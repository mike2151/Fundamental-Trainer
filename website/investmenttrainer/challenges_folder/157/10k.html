   This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that
involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements (including statements to the
effect that we "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "plan" and similar
expressions) that are not statements relating to historical matters should be
considered forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially
from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of
numerous important factors, including those discussed in "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations--Factors that May Affect Future Results."

Item 1. Business.

The Company

   We provide web-enabled payments and cash management, electronic invoice
presentment and payment (EIPP), electronic banking and information reporting
solutions. Bottomline's suite of Financial Resource Management (FRM) offerings
enables businesses and financial institutions worldwide to manage their
critical financial transactions, cash decisions and trading partner financial
relationships, leveraging the Internet. Our products and services enable
organizations to transition from traditional paper-based financial processes to
electronic processes that facilitate e-commerce. Our FRM products extend and
link corporate financial systems to provide better communication and
information within an organization. They also allow organizations to
externalize their activities by enabling banks and trading partners to
participate and collaborate in the information management that FRM provides. To
accomplish this, our FRM modules include Applications, Communication,
Information and Instructions solutions designed to streamline payables,
accelerate receivables and consolidate banking activities, with a single point
of access to real-time information reporting.

  Applications

   Our FRM products adhere to best practices techniques, enabling process
improvements to maximize business value. Our applications include:

   .   Payments and Cash Management;

   .   Electronic Invoice Presentment and Payment (EIPP);

   .   Electronic Banking; and

   .   Information Reporting

  Payments and Cash Management

   Controlling the timing and minimizing the cost of payments, and choosing the
right payment instrument can make a difference in how a business runs. Managing
payments requires protecting a business's paper payments against fraud and
providing remittance information when making payments electronically. However,
people and businesses move at different speeds. Some relationships require
payment by check, some demand electronic payment. Some applications necessitate
wire or SWIFT messaging. Our Universal Payment Engine is a multi-payment
platform that enables organizations to leverage the Internet to connect payment
needs across an enterprise, including payment requests from and delivery to
point-of-need. Browser access for reporting capabilities puts critical
information in the hands of those that need it anytime, anywhere. Adding
Balance and Transaction Reporting (BTR) provides treasury a view into
liabilities and assets before releasing payments. BTR provides a powerful way
to gather all bank account information, including account totals and detailed
transaction data. This single, consolidated payments and reporting engine
improves workflow, and unites financial reporting, bank communications and
payments across all lines of a business into a single, web-enabled
point-of-access.

                                      1

  Electronic Invoice Presentment and Payment (EIPP)

   Accelerating receipts provides more cash to work with for internal and
external investments and enables organizations to pay their bills. Improving
cash flow helps to enhance shareholder value by enabling the production of more
goods and services faster, generating more revenue and getting paid faster. Our
Electronic Invoice Presentment and Payment (EIPP) product is a secure,
interactive system for business-to-business transactions that allows
organizations to present invoicing information, provide online dispute
resolution and accept payments over the Internet. Complemented by our web-based
receivables matching offering, organizations can automate the matching of
payments to open invoices in their ERP systems. However, moving from paper to
collaboration can take time and we understand that not all organizations are
ready to transition at the same speed. To support customers that need to move
in a step-wise fashion, our EIPP solution offers the ability to print, email,
post-only or post and pay invoices from a single invoice file.

  Electronic Banking

   Financial institutions face the same critical business challenges as
corporate enterprises. Connecting a financial institution's disparate back
office processes with client services can be cumbersome and resource intensive.
Enabling clients to browser-access their banking services allows banks to
reduce internal costs, become more competitive and offer an improved customer
experience. Our Electronic Banking solution supports a host of cash management
functions, including balance and transaction reporting, lockbox reporting,
controlled disbursements, positive pay, check imaging, stop payments, and a
broad array of electronic funds transfer instruction. With real-time host
links, it enables the financial institution to provide the corporate entity
with up-to-the-minute access to critical data. Our Electronic Banking product
interfaces directly to a multitude of in-house systems to provide seamless
application integration across one bank or multiple banks.

  Information Reporting

   Reduced closing and reporting cycles, rolling forecasts and escalating
resource costs necessitate consistent data that is available in real-time to
enable faster and better informed decision making. Our Information Reporting
consolidates disparate data files into one pane of information, providing
timely access to critical business information. Distributing this consolidated
picture across the enterprise puts the information in the hands of those that
require it, when they require it. Reducing the time and effort needed to
reconcile various data streams enables executives to make informed decisions
more quickly.

  Communication

   Organizations are leveraging the ubiquity of the Internet to improve partner
relationships, employee satisfaction and increase business. However, it is
often difficult and costly to integrate current business infrastructure with
the Internet. Our suite of FRM products connects the internal workflow of an
enterprise to improve process efficiency. By connecting the different
enterprise systems and replacing paper with electronic workflow, an
organization can streamline activities and provide better process management.
For example, a payment request can automatically flow through an organization
electronically, replacing the need to fax a request from a remote location,
re-keying that request into an internal system, issuing a paper check locally
and then overnighting it to the point of need. With our suite of FRM products,
a request for payment is submitted remotely using a web-browser into the
central payment system. The request is automatically queued for approval and
release. Once it is released, it is printed on a secure printer at the remote
request location. Our suite of FRM products also connects customers, vendors,
banks and partners from outside of the organization to provide better
information and an improved customer experience. This places customer
information at their fingertips when they need it, reducing the internal
resource cost while also improving partner communication. In a competitive
market, it is very important to retain good employees. Delivering payment and
remittance advice electronically for both an organization's payroll, and travel
and expense reimbursement saves employees and employers time and effort. A
self-help portal allows employees to manage their own profile and puts them in
charge.

  Information

   Technology advances have resulted in more and more data being sent to
organizations, but data needs to be processed and consolidated before it
provides business value. When organizations have multiple databases, platforms
and systems that do not communicate, data must be manually rekeyed and
reconciled before it can become information. Our FRM products integrate with
existing corporate systems to enhance the customers' infrastructure investment.
The suite extends an organization's systems financial processing capabilities
normalizes data across different platforms and processes the data so that it
can be viewed by authorized personnel across the enterprise. Accessing
available cash in an organization and deploying it where necessary can save an
organization the expense of unnecessary short-term debt. Views into important
business information can also be extended outside of the organization, enabling
trading partners and employees to add and extract value from an enterprise's
knowledge center. Virtualization enables organizations to intelligently choose
between outsourcing, partnering or continuing to perform activities in-house.
Making these choices requires the ability to break down internal and external
financial and information barriers so that information can readily be shared
inside and outside of an organization. Virtualization requires the secure
integration, normalization and distribution of key information.

  Instructions

   "Hands-free" and "straight-through processing" saves time, eliminates
inadvertent re-keying errors and the costly resources that manual intervention
requires. In order to comply, however, systems both inside and external to an
organization must be in sync. Our FRM suite of products adheres to industry
standards and includes payment instruction sets that interface directly with
bank back office processing systems. Wire transfers, SWIFT messaging or ACH
payments can be entered once at the enterprise level and passed through for
processing without requiring any human intervention. For example, when
requesting a wire transfer from a remote location, first the requisition for
the wire transfer must be keyed in remotely and printed. The printed document
is then faxed to a central location, where the wire transfer information is
again keyed into the central system. After the appropriate approvals, the wire
transfer information is keyed into the bank treasury management system for
uploading to the bank. A reply fax is sent to the remote location to verify
that the request has been submitted. Meanwhile, the bank also prints it out and
keys it into their back office wire transfer processing system. A bank
confirmation is keyed into the treasury management system for access by the
enterprise. This labor-intensive process is costly. The many re-keying efforts
can lead to delays in transfer as well as inadvertent re-keying errors. Our FRM
suite of products electronically instructs the bank of all necessary wire
transfer information, minimizing mistakes and saving time and money.

   All our FRM applications support built-in workflow with a rules engine to
ensure that processes meet or exceed current best business practices.
Conforming to standard business practices reduces costs and process
inefficiencies.

   Our products enable customers to leverage the Internet to automate existing
operations while increasing security and fraud avoidance. They also complement
our customers' existing information systems, accounting applications and
banking functions. To integrate with our customers' existing operations, we
provide multiple options for delivery of complex invoices and detailed payment
or remittance information. We also offer consulting services and related
equipment and supplies to help customers plan, design and implement the
transition from paper to electronic processes.

   With our recent acquisition of Bottomline Europe, a leading U.K.-based
electronic payments automation company, we have opened a new distribution
channel, expanded our international reach and increased our capacity to support
our channel partners and global customers. This acquisition represents a growth
opportunity for us as we seek to provide our products and services to the
global e-commerce marketplace. We have also recently expanded our development
capabilities through the acquisition of a web-based software development
organization based near Boston, Massachusetts.

Strategy

   Our objective is to be the leading provider of software solutions that
enable businesses and financial institutions to create an automated e-business
infrastructure to initiate, implement and manage movements of cash resources,
including bill presentment and payment and electronic banking software. Key
elements of our strategy include the following:

   .   Enable collaborative trading relationships by linking and extending
       current corporate infrastructure. By leveraging our web-enabling
       platform, we can help organizations and financial institutions
       transition from traditional paper-based financial processes to
       electronic, which facilitate e-commerce. Our WebSeries and BankQuest
       products provide the ability to integrate disparate databases and/or
       data streams into a single pane of information. This protects the
       customer's investment in current infrastructure, while allowing them to
       streamline internal business practices and enable collaborative trading.

   .   Focus on the Internet as the medium for billing, payments, and
       electronic banking. Our WebSeries product allows enterprises to use the
       Internet or a corporate intranet to request and disburse payments from
       or to a remote site and to send and receive remittance advices via
       e-mail. With NetTransact, we provide our customers with an integrated,
       secure bill presentment and payment solution that can support e-commerce
       over the Internet. With BankQuest, we enable financial institutions to
       provide their customers with Internet access to electronic banking
       functions such as cash management, trade finance and custody services.

   .   Develop new products and technologies. We intend to develop new products
       and technologies which leverage our existing offerings and customer
       base. To capitalize on the growth of the Internet and e-commerce, and
       changes in payment technologies and practices, we employ professionals
       who are skilled in the complex environments of e-commerce, financial
       EDI, banking and payment and billing systems. Furthermore, our technical
       staff is experienced in the latest database, networking and software
       development tools, technologies and methodologies. We intend to leverage
       this combination of business expertise and technical knowledge to
       enhance our existing offerings and deliver new products and
       technologies, including products incorporating Extensible Markup
       Language (XML), an emerging e-commerce interface standard.

   .   Expand and leverage strategic relationships. We intend to expand and
       leverage our relationships with business partners who play a key role in
       the sales, marketing and distribution of our products. We expect to
       expand sales through our existing strategic alliances with companies
       such as Citibank, UPS Capital, FleetBoston Financial, and others who
       have selected our software for key platforms and who are offering
       NetTransact to their customers. We will also pursue new channel
       partnerships and continue to leverage our relationships with leading
       technology providers. We also intend to expand our relationships with
       enterprise resource planning and accounting system vendors, such as
       Oracle and PeopleSoft, and with consulting firms that assist companies
       with the implementation of our products.

   .   Pursue strategic acquisitions. We believe that significant opportunities
       exist to acquire industry expertise and resources to support our product
       suite, to increase our product offerings and distribution and to provide
       access to international markets. This will assist us in achieving our
       goal of providing a comprehensive business-to-business e-commerce
       infrastructure to initiate, implement and manage movements of cash
       resources to the worldwide market. We therefore intend to continue to
       actively pursue acquisitions of such technologies, as well as
       opportunities to broaden our client base and/or expand our geographic
       presence.

   .   Leverage our European market. We have opened a new distribution channel,
       expanded our international reach and increased our capacity to support
       our global customers and channel partners. We intend to leverage our
       acquisition of Bottomline Europe by introducing our products
       internationally through Bottomline Europe and enhancing our existing
       products with Bottomline Europe's expertise.

                                      4

<PAGE>

   .   Further penetrate our customer base. We intend to further penetrate our
       existing customer base, which we believe is only in the early stages of
       implementing electronic bill presentment and payment solutions.
       Additional sales opportunities to our existing customers include:

      .   cross-selling our electronic bill presentment software to increase
          overall sales of an integrated electronic invoicing and payment
          solution to our existing customers;

      .   selling our electronic banking product to financial institutions that
          are existing customers and that can benefit from its application;

      .   expanding department level installations to encompass an enterprise's
          entire payment system;

      .   adding complementary payment capabilities through sales of additional
          software modules, such as electronic payment and receipt creation or
          check fraud avoidance;

      .   introducing software upgrades and marketing new products; and

      .   generating additional revenues from our customer base by providing
          maintenance and support services and selling supplies.

   .   Expand our customer base. We intend to expand our broad customer base
       by:

      .   supporting our existing co-marketing relationships to introduce our
          products to the customer base of our co-marketers;

      .   adding additional co-marketing relationships with financial
          organizations and hosting partners to re-market our products;

      .   marketing to large enterprises through our direct sales force;

      .   targeting sales opportunities with financial institutions by
          leveraging our experience and industry recognition as the developer
          of FedEDI, the Federal Reserve System's financial Electronic Data
          Interchange, or EDI software solution; and

      .   pursuing strategic acquisitions.

   .   Expand our international capabilities. We intend to enhance our products
       with additional functionality to expand their use in international
       markets. We believe that this will enable us to better accommodate
       existing and future customer needs. We have begun initiatives to extend
       product capabilities to accommodate multiple language output, multiple
       currency requirements and international standards.

       on-line. For example, if an invoice incorrectly states the number of
       products delivered, or if a number of items were damaged during
       shipment, the payer can generate an adjustment that is e-mailed to the
       biller for resolution and pay the undisputed amount, without having to
       wait for a new invoice to be transmitted.

   .   Cost effective bill presentment solution. NetTransact accelerates cash
       receipts and reduces days sales outstanding for billers by identifying
       exceptions and providing an efficient means of dispute resolution.
       NetTransact also provides operational efficiencies to reduce staffing,
       mailing, processing and audit costs, as well as costs associated with
       making adjustments and resolving disputes arising in the billing
       process. Its cost savings and cash flow benefits to both corporate
       billers and payers offer value enhancements to all participants in the
       billing process.

   .   Improved invoice management for payers. NetTransact allows payers to
       identify and manage invoices and schedule payments with time sensitive
       priorities, enhancing their responsiveness and their vendor
       relationships and enabling them to better take advantage of payment term
       discounts. NetTransact also streamlines the payables process to provide
       payers with improved control over cash outflow.

   .   Internet based solution. NetTransact leverages the Internet as an
       effective means of e-commerce and can be integrated with our other
       Internet solutions to provide a complete bill presentment, payment and
       banking solution in an Internet environment.

   .   Savings to billers through reductions in float. By avoiding the delays
       associated with preparation of paper bills, their submission by mail and
       correspondence relating to disputed matters, NetTransact enables
       enterprises to reduce the expense associated with float on outstanding
       receivables.

   .   Seamless integration with accounting systems. NetTransact fully
       integrates with existing accounting systems to facilitate data transfer
       into both the receivables and payables functions for the biller and
       payer respectively.

   NetTransact provides benefits to both billers and payers, creating business
value for trading partners. Its benefits include:

   .   Benefits to Billers

      .   improved cash management by accelerating receipts to reduce total
          days sales outstanding;

  PayBase and WebSeries Products

   PayBase is a client/server, multi-payment platform that provides a single
software solution to control, manage and issue all payments across an entire
enterprise. It allows organizations to migrate from paper-based to electronic
payments as their needs require. PayBase is deployed across an organization's
wide area network and controlled from a centrally managed data center. A single
payment file can issue paper or electronic payments. PayBase can also provide
automatic e-mail delivery of remittance advice both internally and to third
parties such as vendors, customers and employees. PayBase incorporates
administration software that maintains central payment information that can be
accessed from a client on the network by authorized users to approve payments,
review payment status and correct data as appropriate.

   WebSeries is a multi-payment platform that enables organizations to leverage
the Internet to connect payment needs across an enterprise, including payment
requests from and delivery to point-of-need. Browser access for reporting
capabilities provides treasury a view into liabilities and assets before
releasing payments. Our browser access product provides a powerful way to
gather all bank account information, including account totals and detailed
transaction data. This single, consolidated payments and reporting engine
improves workflow, and unites financial reporting, bank communications and
payments across all lines of business into a single, web-enabled point of
access. WebSeries can also provide automatic e-mail delivery of remittance
advice both internally and to third parties such as vendors, customers and
employees. WebSeries incorporates administration software that maintains
central payment information that can be accessed on the Internet or over an
intranet by authorized users to approve payments, review payment status and
correct data as appropriate. WebSeries provides SWIFT and Fedwire payment
capabilities.

   PayBase and WebSeries include the following modules and offerings, which can
be purchased as separate products or together:

   .   WebSeries ASP (Application Service Provider). Our WebSeries ASP offering
       provides organizations with a license to manage and distribute
       Bottomline's web-enabled payment and reporting solutions to their
       customers via a browser from a centrally managed data center. The
       WebSeries ASP product is designed to assist application service
       providers in responding to their customer's demand for secure
       third-party management of their payments and reporting processes. The
       ASP offering for WebSeries can include the ESP (electronically sent
       payments) module, ERADS (electronic remittance advice delivery system)
       module, SWIFT, Fed Wire and laser check modules.

   .   PayBase ASP (Application Service Provider). Our PayBase ASP offering
       provides organizations with a license to manage and distribute
       Bottomline's payment solutions to their customers across a wide area
       network from a centrally managed data center. The PayBase ASP product is
       designed to assist application service providers in responding to their
       customer's demand for secure third-party management of their payments
       process. The ASP offering for PayBase includes the ESP (electronically
       sent payments) module, ERADS (electronic remittance advice delivery
       system) module and laser check module.

                                      7

   .   ESP (Electronically Sent Payments) Module. The ESP module allows users
       to create electronic payments, facilitating the transition from paper
       checks to electronic funds transfer (EFT). This module permits users to
       create electronic payment files for their banks that meet the industry
       requirements of NACHA--The Electronic Payments Association, and other
       financial EDI protocols. With this module, users can process
       instructions received from a payment system, such as payroll or accounts
       receivable. The ESP module can also create electronic tax payments in
       the formats required by federal and state governments. When the ESP
       module is installed with our LaserCheck printing software module,
       PayBase and WebSeries can create both electronic payments and checks
       during the same payment run. The ESP module also can create financial
       EDI payments that will allow vendors to automatically post financial EDI
       remittance information to their accounts receivable system. This feature
       eliminates the need for vendors to manually enter information into
       accounting ledgers, saving time and preventing mistakes.

   .   ERADS (Electronic Remittance Advice Delivery System) Module. The ERADS
       module allows an enterprise to convert to electronic payments
       immediately and to deliver the remittance detail by fax, e-mail,
       communications networks or the Internet, depending on the technology
       available to its payees. This module can be used for payments to
       individuals (e.g., travel and expense reimbursements) and to enterprises
       (e.g., vendor payments). Whenever payments are sent electronically
       through the secure Automated Clearing House network, the ERADS module
       automatically channels the remittance details to each payee by the
       appropriate media and the payee receives an electronic payment directly
       deposited into its bank account. Enterprises can realize cost
       efficiencies through reduced check printing or processing and the lower
       cost of transmitting remittance information electronically.

   .   PayView Module. The PayView module allows users to store and retrieve
       electronic images of printed documents from financial applications such
       as payroll, vendor payments, purchase order creation, claims payment and
       travel and expense reimbursement. These images can be automatically
       e-mailed or faxed to a recipient at the time of creation, reducing costs
       and delays associated with the printing and handling of paper documents.

   .   LaserCheck Module. The LaserCheck module allows users to print checks,
       including all variable data, such as magnetic ink character recognition
       lines, logos and signatures, on blank paper using a laser printer. This
       module can be deployed over the user's network or the Internet wherever
       it is needed, whether in a centralized printing facility, the issuing
       department or in a remote location. With the module's CheckSort feature,
       users can sort checks to lower postage rates and can produce copies in a
       specified order to simplify filing. LaserCheck also provides password
       protection, as well as hardware and software security features, and
       initiates printing of all checks, confirmation notices and reports.

   .   Check Fraud Avoidance Module. The Check Fraud Avoidance module allows
       users to automatically send a digital file of all checks issued to their
       bank. Most commercial banks employ a "Positive Pay" system that
       determines when the check is presented to the bank and whether a bank
       customer has in fact issued it. A number of banks will only reimburse
       customers for check fraud losses if the customer uses Positive Pay. This
       module protects the user from having altered or unissued checks paid
       from their account and protects banks from fraudulent checks received
       from other institutions. The Check Fraud Avoidance software receives its
       data input from PayBase, but can also receive input from a non-PayBase
       system that uses printed checks.

   .   Fedwire for WebSeries. The FedWire module for WebSeries is offered as
       part of Bottomline's e-payment suite of products to facilitate customer
       creation of FedWire payment requests. With this module, WebSeries offers
       application software to secure and manage wire request processes,
       reporting to improve payment monitoring, and payment formatting for
       generation of FedWire transactions from the customer's payment input.
       The resulting formatted files are available for electronic transmission
       to business partners and financial institutions. FedWire for WebSeries
       benefits include:

      .   Increased throughput and more timely data delivery process;

                                      8

      .   Reduced dependence on proprietary bank workstations; and

      .   Increased bank independence and eased transferability of bank service
          providers

   .   SWIFT for WebSeries. The SWIFT module for WebSeries is offered as part
       of Bottomline's e-payment suite of products to facilitate customer
       creation of International payment requests. With this module, WebSeries
       offers application software to secure and manage International payment
       request processes, reporting to improve payment monitoring, and payment
       formatting for generation of International wire transfer transactions
       based on SWIFT 100 message formats. The resulting formatted files are
       available for electronic transmission to business partners and financial
       institutions worldwide.  SWIFT for WebSeries benefits include:

      .   increased throughput and more timely data delivery process;

      .   enhanced payment control and improved audit compliance;

      .   expanded accessibility for initiation of International payment
          requests;

      .   access to SWIFT's BIC directory, the world's largest source of
          address codes for financial institutions;

      .   reduced dependence on proprietary bank workstations; and

      .   increased bank independence and eased transferability of bank service
          providers.

   Our PayBase and WebSeries product suites offer customers the following
benefits:

      .   Internet/intranets remote access capability. Our WebSeries product
          suite provides users with a secure, convenient means to remotely
          access and control payment information. WebSeries enables enterprises
          to manage and control payments through the Internet and corporate
          intranets.

      .   Flexible, dual payment process. Both the WebSeries and PayBase
          product suites have been designed to provide customers with a single
          software solution that permits both paper and electronic payments.
          Their dual payment capacity gives enterprises the flexibility to
          manage the transition to electronic payments at a pace compatible
          with the needs of their vendors and business partners as they evolve
          in response to market demands and government mandates.

      .   Enterprise-wide payment control. Our WebSeries and PayBase product
          suites offer enterprises a centralized payment control and management
          system while allowing users to make payments where needed within an
          organization. They record all payments, transactions and events in a
          central database, which improves cash management, control of
          disbursement and receipt functions and audit capabilities. In
          addition, their payment control capabilities permit enterprises to
          readily outsource payment management functions to banks or other
          third-party suppliers.

      .   Cost-effective payment solution. These product suites provide
          operational efficiencies that reduce staffing, mailing, processing
          and auditing costs as well as costs associated with float, risk of
          error, fraud and fraud related inquiries. They are designed to be
          easy to use and implement, limiting the commitment of an enterprise's
          resources required to achieve operational efficiencies.

      .   Open and scaleable technology. Our WebSeries and PayBase product
          suites run on one or more application servers using Microsoft Windows
          operating systems and leading database servers such as Microsoft SQL
          Server, Oracle and IBM DB2 Universal Server. Their flexible design
          provides an enterprise with a scaleable solution to meet growing
          needs and to manage the migration from a department-wide to an
          enterprise-wide system that provides high levels of performance and
          supports high volumes of payment activity.

                                      9

<PAGE>

      .   Enhanced security and fraud protection. Our WebSeries and PayBase
          product suites reduce the risk of fraud through a secure, encrypted
          database and the control of all payment and operator activity. In
          addition, they can automatically send a file of all checks issued
          instantaneously to the payer's bank, enabling banks to quickly
          isolate fraudulent or incorrect checks and to evaluate questionable
          payments. For its laser-printing process, LaserCheck uses blank paper
          that is non-negotiable until it is printed and can use specialized
          magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) printers for additional
          security.

  BankQuest Product

   Our BankQuest product allows banks to provide their corporate and
institutional customers with electronic banking functions such as cash
management, trade finance and custody services over a browser-based platform.
This improves the processing speed and accuracy of banking functions by
reducing potential delays and input errors associated with a paper-based
process.

   BankQuest acts as an intermediary software solution that integrates with a
bank's legacy systems to enable electronic banking services to their customers
without the bank having to incur the expense of rewriting the existing code and
applications for their back-office functions. Additionally, banks reduce costs
and resources associated with implementing and supporting hardware/software
interfaces for their corporate and institutional customers. In reducing these
costs, banks also have the potential to extend their electronic banking
services to additional customers that were previously restricted by the costs
associated with installation and maintenance.

   Our BankQuest product offers customers the following benefits:

   .   Internet-based access to banking applications. Our BankQuest product
       enables banks to provide their corporate and institutional customers
       with a Web-based interface to access banking services such as trade
       finance, cash management and securities processing.

   .   Increased speed and accuracy in transactions. By providing an electronic
       interface into banking applications, BankQuest helps banks to improve
       the processing speed and accuracy of transactions by reducing potential
       delays and input errors associated with a manual paper-based process.

   .   Integration with existing back-office banking systems. Our BankQuest
       product also serves as an intermediary software solution that integrates
       with legacy banking applications systems. This enables banks to provide
       an additional service to their customers without having to incur the
       expense of rewriting the existing interface for back-office banking
       functions.

   .   Reduced costs associated with electronic banking. Our BankQuest product
       provides Internet access to banking functions that previously required
       dedicated resources to implement. By reducing the costs associated with
       installation and maintenance of these resources, banks can offer
       Internet-based banking services to additional customers.

  SmARtCash Product

   SmARtCash is a software product that improves the efficiency of accounts
receivables transactions by automating the process of matching payments and
remittance information to open invoices. SmARtCash interfaces with the lockbox
services of banks and receives a variety of source data, which is processed to

Bottomline Europe secure print facilities that will in turn produce, stuff and
mail the documents. Bottomline Europe offers the service directly to its
clients and through channel partners like Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (HSBC)
and Royal Bank of Scotland.

Technology

   Our technology focus is on the industry standards for the Internet and
client server platforms. NetTransact, our web-based invoice presentment and
payment system, converts an organization's existing billing file through
proprietary mapping tools into a file that is accessible over the Internet.
This file is transferred using file transfer protocol to a secure hosting
facility where the payer can access the invoice using standard web-browser
technology. Once the payer has reviewed the invoice and made any adjustments,
either on the total invoice or on a line-by-line basis, the payer approves the
amount to be paid and selects a payment date. On the payment date, NetTransact
generates a payment file that contains the bank routing information and account
numbers for both the payer and biller along with the remittance information.
Upon receipt of the file, the biller's bank initiates a secure debit through
the Automated Clearing House that transfers the funds from the payer's
designated account to the biller's designated account.

                                      11

   The server platform for NetTransact is based on Sun Enterprise architecture.
For cross platform capabilities, it is written using the Internet-standard Java
programming language in conjunction with iPlanet Application Server. The data
for NetTransact is stored using database servers such as Sybase Adaptive Server
and Oracle 8i. Database connectivity within the system is accomplished through
the use of JDBC (java database connectivity). The security architecture for
NetTransact is based on sophisticated security protocols that support
firewalls, Secure Socket Layer, HTTPS (hyper text transfer protocol secure) and
digital certificates.

   Two levels of technology comprise the WebSeries product: the toolkit and
packaged applications. The core WebSeries code has no application-specific
logic; it is a library of generic business functions that can be deployed as
part of a packaged product or customized business solution. As a part of its
installation services, Bottomline will use the toolkit and the packaged
applications that reside on a central server to create a solution to meet
specific business requirements.

   WebSeries has three server components, each of which can be independently
scaled. The web front-end servers reside within a DMZ (DMZ is an idiom that
describes a network zone normally set up for web servers between a firewall
blocking the Internet and a firewall protecting the internal network.) The Web
Servers are an independently scalable collective that can be modified for the
required number of simultaneous users. These servers can reside in separate
physical locations as well, with Microsoft IIS and the Bottomline Web
Application COM/DCOM (Component Object Model/ Distributed Component Object
Model) processes (within the MTS (Microsoft Transaction Server) packages)
residing on separate machines with another firewall between them.

   WebSeries is an OLTP (On-Line Transaction Processing) system. The WebSeries
platform currently supports native MS SQL Server7 and Oracle 8i, with support
for other ODBC (Open DataBase Connectivity)-compliant databases planned for
future versions, as data sources for the web reporting functions and reference
information. Reports can be configured to point to other databases for their
content. The database servers are independently tuned to handle the required
transaction traffic and volume.

   The hub servers, which support reformatting and middleware functions are
configured to meet our customers' service level requirements with respect to
data availability and straight-through-processing rates. For example, since all
processes are fully threaded, they can either be scaled up (larger machine) or
scaled out (more machines). Included with the hubs servers can be PayBase/32/
to handle the direct processing of check payments.

   The web servers run exclusively on Microsoft NT/Windows 2000, using IIS and
MTS. MTS is used only as an "object broker" for the application-independent
COM/DCOM modules created to support all WebSeries applications. The software
provides multi-server scalability to allow unlimited concurrent user access.
The Crystal Report objects provide an environment where the client reports and
file download formats can be easily customized, and the Bottomline application
framework allows for easy integration of new products, modules, and transaction
types.

   PayBase/32/, our advanced 32-bit payment processing software, has been
designed using a client/server architecture. The server platform supports open
database connectivity compliant with Unix and Windows NT databases. The server
platform is the warehouse for information relating to the customer's payment
solution, including security tables, application form parameters and audit
tables. The client workstation houses the PayBase executable programs. This
design enables PayBase to be highly scaleable for both distributed and high
volume centralized check printing, as well as electronic payment origination.
The client workstation interacts with the database to ascertain authority, to
retrieve information to create the form and to update the audit tables with
transaction information and payment result information. Print output can be
sent to any addressable network printer. The ESP and Check Fraud Avoidance
modules are bundled with communication software that allows scripting of the
data transmission. Transmission can be executed from any client workstation.

   PayBase is designed to be network independent and can be implemented in
leading network architectures, including Novell, Windows NT and TCP/IP
(Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol). The product

                                      12

<PAGE>

design creates predictable low volume network traffic in order to minimize the
implementation concerns of organizations (for corporate information
technology). Installation of the product is highly automated using
InstallShield.

   PayBase development methods conform to the latest Microsoft development
specifications, including extensive use of MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes)
and the DCOM/COM ((Distributed) Component Object Model) standards. Components
are designed as OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) Automation Servers for ease
of future development and enhancement as well as interoperability. Web enabled
components of PayBase are written as ActiveX controls. The primary development
tool is Visual C++.

   The PayBase suite also includes PayBase DesignerPlus, a sophisticated
proprietary data mapping and design tool. This tool is used to create
sophisticated payment applications using multiple form designs and multiple
payment methods, including all forms of electronic payments. It provides a
proprietary mapping tool to transform any type of host data file into the
format needed for efficient payment creation. The forms design function allows
for easy creation of paper output formats from checks to W-2 forms and includes
design wizards to further automate the process. The data mapping and design are
securely linked to the desired business payment process.

   Our electronic banking product, BankQuest, provides web-enabled information
reporting and transaction initiation, supporting a bank's cash management,
trade finance and custody business. The information reporting modules can
receive information from multiple back-office processing systems and
consolidate the information to be reported with up to eight levels of sub
reporting. The transaction initiation module allows the bank to present
customized instruction screens that replicate functions and features normally
reserved for a workstation environment.

   The BankQuest platform is made up of three main components: web servers,
database servers and hub servers. The web servers are independently scalable
and can be expanded for a high volume of simultaneous users. The database
servers are based on industry standards such as Microsoft and Oracle servers
and they are also independently scalable to service the required transaction
traffic and volume. The hub servers support data reformatting and interface
functions and are also scalable in order to be configured to meet the service
level requirements that are committed to clients in terms of data availability
and processing rates.

   For security, BankQuest provides Secure Socket Layer 3 and 128-bit
encryption. To meet our customer security requirements, BankQuest also provides
supplemental security infrastructures such as digital signatures and smart

level security through an administrative tool that allocates user access levels
along with types of information available to users.

Product Development and Engineering

   Our product development and engineering organization included 145 persons as
of June 30, 2001. There are three primary development groups: software
engineering, quality assurance and technical support. We spent $4.0 million in
fiscal year 1999, $8.6 million in fiscal year 2000 and $13.4 million in fiscal
year 2001 on product development and engineering costs.

   The software engineers have substantial experience in advanced software
development techniques as well as extensive knowledge of the complex processes
involved in business payment and invoicing systems. Our engineers actively
participate in the Microsoft Developer Network, Sun and Oracle developer
programs and maintain extensive knowledge of software development trends,
including the latest Internet technologies.

   Our quality assurance engineers have both extensive knowledge of our
products and expertise in software quality assurance techniques. Members of the
quality assurance group make extensive use of automated software

                                      13

testing tools to facilitate comprehensive and timely testing of products. The
quality assurance group members participate in all beta releases, including all
tests of new products or enhancements, and provide initial training materials
for customer support and service.

   The technical support group provides all product documentation as well as
technical support for released products. Members of the technical group include
experienced technical writers, business analysts and network analysts. The
technical writers are versed in current document technology and work closely
with the software engineers to ensure documentation is clear, current and
complete. The technical support engineers are responsible for the analysis of
reported software problems and work closely with customers and customer support
staff. The group's broad knowledge of our products, operating systems,
communications, and printers allows them to rapidly respond to software
configuration needs.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas

   Prior to the acquisition of Bottomline Europe on August 28, 2000, we did not
have material operations outside the United States. Based on the point of sale,
not customer location, net sales to unaffiliated customers were $50.5 million
in the United States and $26.5 million in the United Kingdom, for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2001.

   At June 30, 2001, long-lived assets of $22.9 million and $56.5 million were
located in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. At June 30,
2000, all long-lived assets were located in the United States.

Customers

   Our customer base includes over 5,500 companies in industries such as
financial services, health care, technology, communications, education, media,
manufacturing and government.

Sales and Marketing

  Sales

   As of June 30, 2001, we employed 88 sales executives worldwide. Among these
sales executives, 55 were divided among four domestic geographical markets and
33 were focused on European markets. Twelve systems engineers and professional
services consultants provide the sales executives with pre-sales technical
support. In addition to our direct selling efforts, we promote our products and
services through strategic relationships with our channel partners.

   In support of our NetTransact product, Bottomline has relationships with
leading organizations including Citibank, UPS Capital, FleetBoston Financial,
and Princeton eCom. We expect these companies to broaden our distribution
channel and support our position in the market. We also promote our products
and services through relationships with enterprise resource planning and
accounting system vendors such as Oracle, PeopleSoft, Microsoft, Lawson and
J.D. Edwards.

  Marketing

   We promote products and services through conferences, seminars, direct
marketing and trade publications. Our marketing partners sponsor joint mailings
and seminars and issue joint press releases with us, as well as advertising on
their web sites. We also maintain membership in key industry organizations such
as Financial Services Technology Consortium, Microsoft Value Chain Initiative,
American Bankers Association and various operating committees of NACHA--The
Electronic Payments Association. In addition, we participate in industry
conferences such as the Association for Financial Professionals, NACHA--The
Electronic Payments Association, Payments, American Payroll Congress and
National User Conferences of Software Partners. We also promote brand awareness
through our public relations program and by advertising in respected buying
guides.

                                      14

Competition

   We encounter competition from various sources for each of our products. For
NetTransact, most companies that entered the market early offered electronic
bill presentment solutions primarily focused on business-to-consumer
applications, such as electronic presentment of utility bills, telephone bills
and cable service bills. These include CheckFree, eDocs, Just-In-Time,
Spectrum, Derivion and Metavante. If these companies expand their focus to
include business-to-business applications, we may encounter increased
competition.

   Over the last year, we have encountered competition for NetTransact from
several companies that have entered the business-to-business electronic bill
presentment and payment market. These include BCE Emergis in Canada and
BillingZone, a private company that is a spin-off of PNC Bank partnered with
Perot Systems.

   For PayBase and WebSeries, we primarily compete with companies, such as
CheckFree and CyberStarts (formerly Westcorp.), that offer a broad suite of
electronic data interchange products, a broad spectrum of electronic payments
solutions, and laser check printing software and services. To a lesser extent,
we compete with providers of enterprise resource planning solutions, such as
SAP and PeopleSoft, and providers of traditional payment products, including
check stock and check printing software and services, such as Standard
Register. In addition, some financial institutions operate as outsourced
providers of check printing and electronic payment services for their
customers. We also experience competition from our customers and potential
customers who develop, implement and maintain their own payment solutions.

   For BankQuest, we primarily compete with companies, such as S1, that offer a
wide range of financial services including electronic banking applications. We
also encounter competition from companies that provide traditional treasury
workstation solutions. These companies include Brokat Financial Services,
Magnet Communications and Politzer and Haney. In addition, we compete with a
bank's internal technical development teams that develop and implement their
own proprietary solution.

   For all of our products, we believe we compete on a number of factors,
including:

   .   scope, quality and cost-effectiveness of our solutions;

   .   industry knowledge and expertise;

   .   interoperability of solutions with existing information technology and
       payments infrastructure;

   .   product performance and technical features;

   .   patented and proprietary technologies; and

   .   customer service and support.

   Although a number of our competitors may be better positioned to compete in
certain aspects of the payments industry, we believe that our market position
is enhanced by:

   .   our ability to provide a comprehensive e-business infrastructure for use
       by businesses and financial institutions to present invoices, make
       payments and conduct electronic banking;

   .   our relationships with our strategic partners;

   .   our large customer base; and

   .   the level of industry expertise of our development, sales and customer
       service and support professionals.

   Although we believe that we compete favorably in our industry, the markets
for payment management, electronic bill presentment and electronic banking
software are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological
change and a number of factors could adversely affect our ability to compete in
the future.

                                      15

<PAGE>

Backlog

   At the end of fiscal year 2001, backlog, including deferred revenue, was $31
million. At the end of fiscal year 2000, backlog was also $31 million. We do
not believe that backlog is a meaningful indicator of sales that can be
expected for any period, and there can be no assurance that backlog at any
point in time will translate into revenue in any subsequent period.

Proprietary Rights

   We rely upon a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and
trade-secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our
technology and products. We have filed patent applications relating to our
products. However, there can be no assurance that our patent applications, or
any others that may be filed in the future, will issue or will be of sufficient
scope and strength to provide meaningful protection of our technology or any
commercial advantage to us, or that the issued patents will not be challenged,
invalidated or circumvented. In addition, we rely upon a combination of
copyright and trademark laws and non-disclosure and other intellectual property
contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary rights. Given the rapidly
changing nature of the industry's technology, the creative ability of our
development, engineering, programming, marketing and service personnel may be
as or more important to our competitive position as the legal protections and
rights afforded by patents. We also enter into agreements with our employees
and clients that seek to limit and protect the distribution of proprietary
information. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect
our property rights, however, will be adequate to deter misappropriation of
proprietary information, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use and
take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual proprietary rights.

Government Regulation

   Although our operations have not been subject to any material
industry-specific governmental regulation, some of our existing and potential
customers are subject to extensive federal and state governmental regulations.
In addition, governmental regulation in the financial services industry is
evolving, particularly with respect to payment technology, and our customers
may become subject to increased regulation in the future. Accordingly, our
products and services must be designed to work within the regulatory
constraints under which our customers operate.

   Federal regulations require that all federal payments, other than payments
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, must be made electronically. These
regulations require that the conversion from checks to electronic payments be
made in two phases. During the first phase, recipients who became eligible to
receive federal payments on or after July 26, 1996 were required to receive
payments electronically unless they certified in writing that they did not have
an account with a financial institution or an authorized payment agent. The
second phase began on January 2, 1999. Beginning on that date, all federal
payments, except payments made under the Internal Revenue Code, are required to
be made electronically.

   The National Automated Clearing House Association now requires that, upon
the request of the receiver of an electronic payment, its bank must provide to
each receiver all payment-related information contained within the transmitted
remittance information. Banks must provide this information to their receivers
by the opening of business on the second banking day following the settlement
date of the entry.

   Current treasury regulations require that a business that paid more than
$50,000 in annual employment or other depository taxes in 1995, 1996 or 1997
now make such payments electronically. This requirement is effective for return
periods beginning before January 1, 2000. The date upon which a business first
becomes subject to the electronic payments requirement depends on the year in
which the business first paid more than $50,000 in depository taxes. Businesses
that made in excess of $200,000 of aggregate federal tax deposits in 1998 must
make such deposits electronically for all return periods beginning on or after
January 1, 2000. If a business first exceeds the $200,000 threshold in 1999 or
in any subsequent year, the electronic deposit obligation will be imposed for
the return period beginning after December 31 of the year ending after the year
the threshold

                                      16

<PAGE>

was surpassed and will continue for all succeeding years. Non-complying
taxpayers may be subject to a 10% penalty if they fail to comply with such
requirements. In addition, state and local taxing authorities have been
implementing electronic solutions for collecting tax payments. The electronic
payment of certain taxes is required by law in states such as New York,
California, Connecticut and Arkansas.

Item 2. Properties.

   We currently lease approximately 54,000 square feet of office space at our
headquarters in Portsmouth, New Hampshire under four leases that expire from
2001 to 2002. In August 2000, we entered into a lease for approximately 83,000
square feet of space for a new headquarters facility in Portsmouth, New

York, New York; and Boston, Massachusetts.

   We own approximately 16,000 square feet of office space in Reading, England
and lease international office space in Reading, London, and Leeds, England;

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

   On July 25, 2001, an action was filed against BancBoston Roberston Stephens,
an underwriter of our initial public offering, in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint in the action does
not name us or any of our officers or directors, and asserts claims against the
underwriter similar to those described in the Cyrek action described below. As
the Cyrek action also names BancBoston Robertson Stephens as a defendant, there
is a possibility that this action will be consolidated with the Cyrek action.

   On August 10, 2001, a class action complaint was filed against us in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York: Paul Cyrek
v. Bottomline Technologies, Inc.; Daniel M. McGurl; Robert A. Eberle;
Fleetboston Robertson Stephens, Inc.; Deutsche Banc Alex Brown Inc.; CIBC World
Markets; and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. The complaint filed in the action asserts
claims under Sections 11, 12(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. The complaint asserts, among other things, that the description in
our prospectus for our initial public offering was materially false and
misleading in describing the compensation to be earned by the underwriters of
our offering, and in not describing certain alleged arrangements among
underwriters and initial purchasers of our common stock from the underwriters.
The complaint seeks damages (or in the alternative tender of the plaintiff and
the class's Bottomline common stock and rescission of their purchases of our
common stock purchased in the initial public offering), costs, attorneys' fees,
experts' fees and other expenses.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

   No matter was submitted to a vote of our stockholders, through the
solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2001.

Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Common Stock and Related Stockholder
Matters.

   Our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol "EPAY" on February 12, 1999. Prior to that date, there was no
established public trading market for our common stock. The following table
sets forth the high and low sale prices of our common stock for the periods
indicated, as quoted on the Nasdaq National Market.

   As of September 18, 2001, there were approximately 13,778,400 holders of
record of our common stock.

   The closing price for our common stock on September 18, 2001 was $4.25. For
purposes of calculating the aggregate market value of the shares of our common
stock held by non-affiliates, as shown on the cover page of this report, it has
been assumed that all the outstanding shares were held by non-affiliates except
for the shares held by our directors and executive officers. However, there may
be other persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of ours.

   We have never paid dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain our
earnings for use in our business and, therefore, do not anticipate paying any
cash dividends on our common stock for at least the next fiscal year.

Sales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds

   On August 28, 2000, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with
stockholders of Checkpoint Holdings, Ltd. We issued 1,013,333 shares of common
stock and warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of 100,000 shares of our
common stock at an exercise price of $50.00 per share and loan notes in the
aggregate amount of approximately $19.8 million to the sellers in exchange for
all of the outstanding capital stock of Checkpoint. The total purchase price,
including the issuance of such securities, was approximately $60.1 million. In
connection with the acquisition, an additional 336,667 shares of  our common
stock and loan notes in the aggregate amount of approximately $579,000 were
issued to satisfy pre-existing loan note obligations of Checkpoint in the
aggregate amount of $10.3 million. On April 26, 2001 we issued 732,798 shares
of our common stock in prepayment of the loan notes. These securities were
registered under the Securities Act under Registration Statements on Form S-3
(Registration Nos. 333-50810 and 333-62330).

   On August 28, 2000, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with
Flashpoint, Inc. and the sole stockholder of Flashpoint. We issued 242,199
shares of common stock to the seller in exchange for all of the outstanding
capital stock of Flashpoint. The aggregate purchase price, including the
issuance of such securities, was approximately $16.8 million. A portion of
these securities, 11,178 shares of common stock, was registered under the
Securities Act under a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No.
333-43842).

Use of Proceeds of Initial Public Offering

   On February 12, 1999 we made an initial public offering of 3,910,000 shares
of common stock registered under a Registration Statement on Form S-1
(Registration No. 333-67309), which was declared effective by the Securities
and Exchange Commission on February 11, 1999. Proceeds of our initial public
offering were used during the period between February 12, 1999 and September
30, 2000 in the amount of $34.9 million to acquire software and related
proprietary intellectual property, assets and certain liabilities from The
Northern Trust Company, Integrated Cash Management Services, Inc., OLC
Software, Inc., Checkpoint Holdings, Ltd. and Flashpoint, Inc. All of the net
proceeds from our initial public offering have been applied.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data.

   You should read the following consolidated financial data in conjunction
with the Financial Statements, including the related notes, and "Item
7--Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations." The results shown herein are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for any future periods. This Annual Report on Form 10-K
contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The
statements contained in this annual report that are not purely historical are
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities

limiting the foregoing, the words "may," will," "should," "could," "expects,"
"plans," "intends," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts,"
"potential," "continue" and similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this
Form 10-K report are based on information available to us up to, and including
the date of this document, and we assume no obligation to update any such
forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from
those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain
factors, including those set forth below under "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Certain Factors
That May Affect Future Results" and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. You should
carefully review those factors and also carefully review the risks outlined in
other documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

   Prior to our initial public offering of common stock in February 1999, there
were 801,000 shares of redeemable common stock outstanding which were
redeemable at the option of the holders at a redemption price that increased
over time. The redemption rights terminated upon the occurrence of our initial
public offering. The earnings (loss) per share available to common stockholders
shown below for periods prior and up to the initial public offering have been
adjusted to reflect the increase in the redemption price for each such period.
The shares used in computing diluted earnings per share available to common
stockholders for periods prior and up to the initial public offering include
the redeemable common stock. For periods occurring after our initial public
offering, such shares are included in the basic earnings per share available to
common stockholders.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.

   The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
of operations should be read in conjunction with "Selected Consolidated
Financial Data" and the financial statements and notes thereto appearing
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview

   Our suite of Financial Resource Management (FRM) offerings enables
businesses and financial institutions to manage their critical financial
transactions, cash decisions and trading partner financial relationships,
leveraging the Internet. Our suite of products extends and links corporate
systems to maximize business value as organizations transition from paper to
digital financial transactions. In 1989, we released our first product,
LaserCheck for DOS, to offer companies a cost-effective means to issue checks
using specialized laser printers and toners, eliminating the need for
pre-printed, negotiable check stock. In 1992, we entered into an arrangement
with Xerox Corporation to sell an advanced laser printer and newly developed
magnetic ink character recognition toners. Over the next few years we became
one of the largest re-sellers of Xerox Corporation magnetic ink character
recognition products. We then adapted our LaserCheck products to run on Windows
3.X and Windows 95 operating platforms and developed new check fraud avoidance
software applications. Our PayBase payments software now provides a
web-interface to control, manage, and issue all payments, whether paper-based
or electronic, across an enterprise.

   During fiscal year 2000, in order to expand our suite of applications, we
acquired NetTransact, an electronic bill presentment and payment software
product from The Northern Trust Company. NetTransact allows companies to
present billing information and accept payments over a secure, interactive
system for complex business-to-business transactions. We also acquired certain
assets and assumed certain liabilities from Integrated Cash Management, Inc.
(ICM), whose BankQuest software offers powerful cash management tools and
Internet access to advanced banking applications such as cash management, trade
finance and securities processing. We also acquired all the outstanding shares
of OLC Software, Inc., whose SmARtCash product improves the efficiency of
accounts receivable transactions by automating the process of matching payments
and remittance information to open invoices.

                                      22

<PAGE>

   During fiscal year 2001 we acquired two companies, U.K.-based Checkpoint
Holdings, Ltd. (doing business as Bottomline Europe) and Flashpoint, Inc.
(Flashpoint), a professional software development company. In acquiring
Bottomline Europe, we have opened a new distribution channel, expanded our
international reach and increased our capacity to support our global customers
and channel partners. We intend to leverage this acquisition by introducing our
products internationally through Bottomline Europe and enhancing our existing
products with the expertise of our Bottomline Europe team. In acquiring
Flashpoint, we have enhanced our research and development with core expertise
in Windows-based software development, leading browser applications, and
programming languages.

   Our goal is to be the leading provider of software solutions that enable
businesses and financial institutions to create an automated e-business
infrastructure to initiate, implement and manage the movements of cash
resources. Our customer base, now at over 5,500 companies, is in industries
such as financial services, health care, technology, communications, education,
media, manufacturing and government. We provide our products and services to
the leading organizations in a broad array of industries and currently include
over half of the Fortune 100 companies and over 90 of the FTSE (Financial
Times) 100 companies.

   Our revenues are primarily derived from the following three sources:

   .   Software License Fees. We derive software license revenues from our
       suite of software applications, which are generally based on the number
       of software applications and user licenses purchased, including PayBase,
       NetTransact, BankQuest and iPoint. Fees from the sale of PayBase and
       iPoint software licenses are generally recognized upon delivery of the
       software to the customer. Certain software arrangements, primarily
       NetTransact and BankQuest software fees, are recognized on a percentage
       of completion basis due to the fact that they require significant
       customization and modification.

   .   Service and Maintenance Fees. We derive service and maintenance revenues
       from (a) consulting, design, project management and training fees, which
       are fixed on a project-to-project basis, (b) customer support and
       maintenance fees and (c) customer-specific customization of our
       BankQuest and NetTransact products. Revenues relating to custom
       consulting, design and service fees are recognized at the time services
       are rendered. Customer support fees are established as a percentage,
       typically 18%, of the list price for the software license, and are
       prepaid annually. Support and maintenance agreements generally have a
       term of 12 months and are renewable annually. We recognize revenues
       related to customer support and maintenance fees ratably over the life
       of the agreement. Certain service contracts are recognized on a
       percentage of completion basis due to extensive customization and
       lengthy implementation.

   .   Equipment and Supplies Sales. We derive equipment and supplies revenues
       from the sales of printers, check paper and magnetic ink character
       recognition toners that are recognized at the time of delivery. With the
       adoption of EITF No. 00-10, "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees
       and Costs" on April 1, 2001, all shipping and handling amounts billed to
       a customer are classified as equipment and supplies revenues. Financial
       statements for prior periods presented have been reclassified to comply
       with the classification guidelines of EITF 00-10.

   We expect to continue making significant investments in product development
and engineering in order to enhance our current products, develop new products
and further advance our Internet and payment technologies. Future investments
in product development and engineering will generally be related to the hiring
of additional software engineering personnel.

   We record software development costs in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 86, which begins upon the establishment of
technological feasibility. In the development of our new products and
enhancements to existing products, the technological feasibility of the
software is not established until substantially all product development is
complete, including the development of a working model. We have not had any
software development costs that were capitalized during the last fiscal year
and do not currently have any software development costs that are being
capitalized, since all costs were incurred prior to attaining technological
feasibility.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

  Accounting Pronouncements

   In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. These standards, among other
things, eliminate the pooling of interests method of accounting for future
acquisitions and require that goodwill no longer be amortized, but instead be
subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis. SFAS No.141 was
effective for all business combinations completed after June 30, 2001.

   SFAS No. 142 must be adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001 (fiscal 2003 for us). Under the provision of SFAS No. 142, intangible
assets with definite useful lives will be amortized to their estimable residual
values over those estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefits
consumed. Such intangible assets remain subject to the impairment provisions of
SFAS No. 121. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will
be tested for impairment annually in lieu of being amortized. Goodwill and
intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001 will continue to be amortized
until adoption of SFAS No. 142.

   Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, we will cease our annual amortization of
goodwill. Our current annual amortization of goodwill is approximately $24
million. We currently plan to adopt SFAS No. 142 effective July 1, 2002 (fiscal
year 2003).

Reclassifications

   Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the
current year presentation. Such reclassifications had no impact on the results
of operations or stockholders' equity for any year presented.

Recent Developments

   On September 17, 2001 our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up
to $3 million of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in
privately negotiated transactions.

</TABLE>

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2001 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2000

  Revenues

   Total revenues increased by $27.5 million to $77.1 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2001 from $49.6 million in the fiscal year ended June 30,
2000, an increase of 55%.

   Software Licenses. Software license fees increased by $4.4 million to $23.9
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 from $19.5 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2000, an increase of 23%. Software license fees represented
31% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 compared to 39% of
total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000. The increase in software
license fees was due primarily to the revenue contribution from Bottomline
Europe. The decrease in percentage of total revenue was due primarily to the
economic slowdown experienced in the U.S. marketplace, which forced many
potential customers to cutback or delay information technology and capital
spending. In addition, Bottomline Europe's strong revenue contribution in
service and maintenance, and equipment and supplies revenues further reduced
software as a

                                      25

<PAGE>

percentage of total revenues. Based on current product plans, we anticipate
that software license fees will increase during the next fiscal year,
reflecting a full year of software license fee contribution from Bottomline
Europe and internal growth.

   Service and Maintenance. Service and maintenance fees increased by $13.4
million to $33.3 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 from $19.9
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000, an increase of 67%. Service and
maintenance fees represented 43% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2001 compared to 40% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June
30, 2000. The increase in service and maintenance fees was due to the revenue
contribution from Bottomline Europe as well as strong recurring maintenance
revenues from the Company's existing installed customer base. Based on current
product plans, we anticipate that service and maintenance fees will increase
during the next fiscal year, reflecting a full year of service and maintenance
fee contribution from Bottomline Europe and internal growth.

   Equipment and Supplies. Equipment and supplies sales increased by $9.6
million to $19.9 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 from $10.3
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000, an increase of 93%. Equipment
and supplies sales represented 26% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2001 compared to 21% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June
30, 2000. The increase in equipment and supplies sales was primarily due to the
strong revenue contribution from Bottomline Europe. Based on current product
plans, we anticipate that equipment and supplies revenues will not change
significantly during the next fiscal year.

  Cost of Revenues

   Software Licenses. Software license costs consist of expenses incurred by us
to manufacture, package and distribute our software products and related
documentation, costs of licensing third-party software incorporated into our
products, and royalties to Northern Trust on revenues from our NetTransact
product. Software license costs increased by $1.7 million to $2.3 million in
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 from $561,000 in the fiscal year ended June
30, 2000, an increase of 310%. Software license costs increased to 10% of
software license fees in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 compared to 3% in
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000. The increase in software license costs as
a percentage of software license revenues was due primarily to a write down of
third-party software acquired for resale and held in inventory. We anticipate
that software license costs as a percent of software license revenues will
decrease during the next fiscal year as we do not anticipate any further write
downs of third-party software held in inventory.

   Service and Maintenance. Service and maintenance costs include salary
expense and other related costs for our customer service, maintenance and
telephone support staffs, as well as third-party contractor expenses. Service
and maintenance costs increased by $7.4 million to $17.1 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2001 from $9.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30,
2000, an increase of 76%. Service and maintenance costs were 52% of service and
maintenance revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 compared to 49% of
service and maintenance revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000. The
increase in service and maintenance costs was due primarily to the increased
costs with lower margin contribution by Bottomline Europe. We anticipate
service and maintenance costs as a percentage of service and maintenance
revenues will remain at current year levels during the next fiscal year.

   Equipment and Supplies. Equipment and supplies costs increased by $6.8
million to $14.5 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 from $7.7
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000, an increase of 88%. Equipment
and supplies costs were 73% of equipment and supplies sales in the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2001 compared to 75% of equipment and supplies sales in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2000. The increase in equipment and supplies costs
was attributable to the corresponding increase in equipment and supplies
revenues, primarily attributable to the contribution of Bottomline Europe. We
anticipate that equipment and supplies costs as a percent of equipment and
supplies revenues will remain at current year levels during the next fiscal
year.

  Operating Expenses

  Sales and Marketing:

   Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales
commissions, travel, public relations and marketing materials and trade shows.
Sales and marketing expenses increased by $10.2 million to $24.0 million in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 from $13.8 million in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2000, an increase of 74%. Excluding the warrants issued to two
companies as discussed below sales and marketing expenses were 31% of total
revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 compared to 28% in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2000. The dollar increase was due primarily to staffing and
personnel related costs necessary to support our expanding operations resulting
from our Bottomline Europe and Flashpoint acquisitions. We anticipate that
sales and marketing expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenues during
the next fiscal year.

   Expense Associated with Warrants Issued. Expense associated with warrants
issued to two companies in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 of $11.9 million
represents non-cash charges related to the issuance of the warrants which
vested immediately. We valued the warrants using the Black-Scholes method,
assuming an expected life of three years and a volatility of 91%. There was no
comparable transaction for the year ended June 30, 2001.

   Product Development and Engineering:

   Product Development and Engineering. Product development and engineering
expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development.
Product development and engineering expenses increased by $4.8 million to $13.4
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 from $8.6 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2000, an increase of 56%. Before the in-process research
and development charge and the stock compensation expense described below,
product development and engineering expenses were a consistent 17% of total
revenues in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000. The dollar
increase was due primarily to the acquisitions of Flashpoint and Bottomline
Europe. We anticipate that product development and engineering expenses will
remain at current year levels as a percentage of revenues during the next
fiscal year.

   In-process Research and Development. In-process research and development of
$3.9 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 represents non-cash charges
related to the NetTransact and ICM acquisitions for in-process research and
development. The in-process research and development projects were valued using
an income approach, which included the application of a discounted future
earnings methodology. Using this methodology, the value of the in-process
technology is comprised of the total present value of the future earnings
stream attributable to the technology throughout its anticipated life. No
alternative future uses were identified prior to reaching technological
feasibility. There was no comparable amount for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2001 since there was no material in-process research and development related to
the acquisitions completed in the most recent fiscal year.

   Stock Compensation Expense. In connection with our acquisition of
Flashpoint, we assumed all of the outstanding common stock options of
Flashpoint, which were exchanged for options for our common stock, and recorded
deferred compensation of $1.3 million relating to the intrinsic value of the
unvested options. The deferred compensation is being amortized to expense over
the remaining vesting period of the options and resulted in $349,000 of stock
compensation expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001. There was no
comparable amount for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000. We expect stock
compensation expense to increase slightly due to a full year of expense during
the next fiscal year.

   General and Administrative:

   General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance
employees, legal and accounting services and certain facilities-related
expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $4.8 million to
$13.4 million in the fiscal year ended

                                      27

<PAGE>

June 30, 2001 from $8.6 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000, an
increase of 56%. Before the amortization of intangible assets described below,
general and administrative expenses were a consistent 17% of total revenues in
the fiscal years ended June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000. The dollar increase was
due primarily to staffing and personnel related costs necessary to support our
expanding operations, and facility and information system requirements
resulting from our Bottomline Europe and Flashpoint acquisitions. We anticipate
that general and administrative expenses will remain at current year levels as
a percentage of revenues during the next fiscal year.

   Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets
increased by $28.2 million to $30.5 million in the fiscal year ended June 30,
2001 from $2.3 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000. The increase in
current year amortization is due to the current year increase in intangible
asset base as a result of the acquisitions of Bottomline Europe and Flashpoint.
The carrying value of intangible assets is periodically reviewed by us based on
the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows of the related asset.
When and if an impairment occurs, we will adjust the carrying value of the
intangible assets. Net intangible assets and goodwill of $71.8 million at June
30, 2001 were 62% of total assets and 77% of stockholders' equity. Net
intangible assets and goodwill of $8.4 million at June 30, 2000 were 12% of
total assets and 15% of stockholders' equity. We anticipate that amortization
of intangible assets will increase during the next fiscal year due to a full
year of amortization on fiscal year 2001 acquisitions.

  Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net consists of interest
income and expense, and other gains and losses. Other income (expense), net was
$734,000 of expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 compared to $1.8
million of other income in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000. This change was
due primarily to interest expense on promissory notes issued in connection with
our acquisition of Bottomline Europe in August 2000. The decrease in interest
income was due to a reduced cash balance in the current period as a result of
cash used in our acquisitions. We expect to generate other income, net during
the next fiscal year resulting from interest earned on our cash and investment
portfolio.

  Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $714,000
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, which represents a change of $2.1
million from a $1.4 million benefit in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000. The
effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 was 2% compared to 9%
benefit in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000. The effective tax rate of 2% in
the fiscal year June 30, 2001 differed from the federal statutory rate due
principally to the recording of a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax
assets, primarily goodwill amortization and net operating loss carryforward.
The effective tax benefit of 9% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 differed
from the federal statutory rate due principally to the effect of expenses
related to the issuance of warrants during fiscal year 2000 that are not
deductible for tax purposes and acquisition related amounts which are not
deductible for tax purposes. As of June 30, 2001 and 2000 we had net deferred
tax assets of $0 and $2.8 million respectively. The realizability of the net
deferred tax assets at June 30, 2000 was deemed more likely than not, as the
net deferred tax assets could be carried back to taxes paid in prior years. The
valuation allowance increased by $12,441,000 million from June 30, 2000. This
increase was required to reduce the net deferred tax assets to zero, the amount
that is now considered more likely than not to be realized.

  Net Loss. Net loss increased by $25.7 million to a $40.0 million loss in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 from a $14.3 million loss in the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2000. The increase in net loss was due primarily to acquisition
related charges and the increased operating costs associated with our
acquisitions.

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2000 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1999

  Revenues

   Total revenues increased by $9.9 million to $49.6 million in the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2000 from $39.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999,
an increase of 25%.

                                      28

<PAGE>

   Software Licenses. Software license fees increased by $3.6 million to $19.5
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 from $15.9 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1999, an increase of 23%. Software license fees represented
39% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 compared to 40% of
total revenues in the fiscal years ended June 30, 1999. The increase in
software license fees was due primarily to growing market acceptance of our
NetTransact software product, which was introduced in fiscal 2000.

   Service and Maintenance. Service and maintenance fees increased by $7.5
million to $19.9 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 from $12.4
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, an increase of 60%. Service and
maintenance fees represented 40% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2000 compared to 31% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June
30, 1999. The increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of sales
of software licenses, which resulted in increased orders for services and sales
of software maintenance and technical support. In addition, there were several
large contracts during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 accounted for on a
percentage of completion basis due to the required customization and
modifications.

   Equipment and Supplies. Equipment and supplies sales decreased by $1.1
million to $10.3 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 from $11.4
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, a decrease of 10%. Equipment
and supplies sales represented 21% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2000 compared to 29% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June
30, 1999. The decrease in equipment and supplies sales was due primarily to our
de-emphasis of this lower margin source of revenues.

  Cost of Revenues

   Software Licenses. Software license costs consist of expenses incurred by us
to manufacture, package and distribute our software products and related
documentation, costs of licensing third-party software incorporated into our
products, and royalties to Northern Trust on revenues from our NetTransact
product. Software license costs increased by $300,000 to $561,000 in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2000 from $261,000 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999,
an increase of 115%. Software license costs increased to 3% of software license
fees in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 compared to 2% at June 30, 1999.
The increase in software license costs was due primarily to the NetTransact
royalties due to The Northern Trust Company.

   Service and Maintenance. Service and maintenance costs include salary
expense and other related costs for our customer service, maintenance and
telephone support staffs, as well as third-party contractor expenses. Service
and maintenance costs increased by $4.4 million to $9.7 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2000 from $5.3 million in the fiscal year ended June 30,
1999, an increase of 83%. Service and maintenance costs were 49% of service and
maintenance revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 compared to 43% of
service and maintenance revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999. The
increase in service and maintenance costs was due primarily to increased
staffing and personnel related costs to support the BankQuest product.

   Equipment and Supplies. Equipment and supplies costs decreased by
approximately $700,000 to $7.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000
from $8.4 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, a decrease of 8%.
Equipment and supplies costs were 75% of equipment and supplies sales in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2000, which is consistent with costs totaling 74% of
equipment and supplies sales in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999.

Operating Expenses

   Sales and Marketing:

   Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales
commissions, travel, public relations and marketing materials and trade shows.
Sales and marketing expenses increased by $2.8 million to $13.8 million in the
fiscal year ended June 30,

                                      29

<PAGE>

2000 from $11.0 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, an increase of
26%. Sales and marketing expenses, excluding the warrant discussed below, were
a consistent 28% of total revenues in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2000 and
1999. The dollar increase was due primarily to increases in staffing and
personnel related costs.

   Expense Associated with Warrants Issued. Expense associated with warrants
issued of $11.9 million represent non-cash charges related to the issuance of
warrants, that vested immediately, to two companies. We valued the warrants
issued using the Black-Scholes method assuming an expected life of three years
and a volatility of 91%. There was no comparable amount for the year ended June
30, 1999 since no such warrants were issued in 1999.

   Product Development and Engineering:

   Product Development and Engineering. Product development and engineering
expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development.
Product development and engineering expenses increased by $4.6 million to $8.6
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 from $4.0 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1999, an increase of 116%. Product development and
engineering expenses before the in-process research and development charge
described below were 17% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30,
2000 compared to 10% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999.
The dollar increase was due primarily to increases in staffing and personnel
related costs to support our expanding suite of software products.

   In-process Research and Development. In-process research and development of
$3.9 million represents non-cash charges related to the NetTransact and ICM
acquisitions for in-process research and development during the year ended June
30, 2000. The in-process research and development projects were valued using an
Income Approach, which included the application of a discounted future earnings
methodology. Using this methodology, the value of the in-process technology is
comprised of the total present value of the future earnings stream attributable
to the technology throughout its anticipated life. No alternative future uses
were identified prior to reaching technological feasibility. There was no
comparable amount for the year ended June 30, 1999 since all the acquisitions
occurred in fiscal 2000.

   General and Administrative:

   General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance
employees, legal and accounting services and certain facilities-related
expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $3.8 million to $8.6
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 from $4.8 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1999, an increase of 81%. General and administrative
expenses were 17% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000
compared to 12% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999. The
dollar increase was due primarily to staffing and personnel related costs,
additional facility and information system requirements resulting from
acquisitions and growth, and other expenses necessary to support our expanding
operations.

   Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets was
$2.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2000. There was no comparable amount
for the year ended June 30, 1999 since all the acquisitions occurred in fiscal
2000. Net intangible assets and goodwill of $8.4 million at June 30, 2000 were
12% of total assets and 15% of stockholders' equity. The carrying value of
intangible assets is periodically reviewed by us based on the expected future
undiscounted operating cash flows of the related asset. If an impairment is
indicated, we will adjust the carrying value of the intangible assets. No event
has occurred that would impair the value of long-lived assets recorded in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

  Interest Income (Expense), Net. Interest income (expense), net consists of
interest income and interest expense. Interest income (expense), net increased
by $1.1 million to $1.8 million of interest income in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2000 from $726,000 of interest income in the fiscal year ended June
30, 1999. The increase in interest income was due to higher available cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, as a result of our initial
public offering in February 1999, on hand for the entire fiscal year 2000.

                                      30

<PAGE>

  Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. Benefit for income taxes was $1.4
million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 which represents a change of
$4.1 million from a $2.7 million provision in the fiscal year ended June 30,
1999. The effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 was 9%
compared to 40% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999. The effective tax rate
of 9% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 differed from the federal
statutory rate due principally to the effect of expenses related to the
issuance of warrants during fiscal year 2000 that are not deductible for tax
purposes and acquisition related amounts which are not deductible for tax
purposes. The effective tax rate of 40% in the fiscal year June 30, 1999
differed from the federal statutory rate due principally to the effect of state
income taxes. As of June 30, 2000 and 1999 we had net deferred tax assets of
$2.8 million and $412,000 respectively. The realizability of the net deferred
tax assets at June 30, 2000 is more likely than not as such net deferred tax
assets are principally able to be carried back to taxes paid in prior years.
The valuation allowance increased by $2.3 million from June 30, 1999. This
increase was required to reduce the net deferred tax assets to the amount that
is considered more likely than not to be realized.

  Net Income (Loss). Net income decreased by $18.4 million to a $14.3 million
loss in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 from $4.1 million of income in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1999. The decrease in net income was due primarily
to the expense associated with warrants issued, acquisition related charges and
the increased operating costs associated with our growth.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

   We have financed our operations primarily from cash provided by operating
activities and the sale of our common stock. We had net working capital of
$13.6 million at June 30, 2001, including cash and cash equivalents totaling
$13.2 million.

   Net cash used in operating activities was $1.5 million in the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2001. Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.4 million
in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 and $3.7 million in the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1999. Net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2001 was primarily due to the net loss and decreases in accounts
payable, accrued expenses, and income taxes payable partially offset by
decreases in accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, and increases in
deferred revenues. Net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal
years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 was primarily the result of net income,
after one time acquisition charges, and increases in deferred revenues,
accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by increases in
accounts receivable and prepaid expenses.

   Net cash used in investing activities was $3.7 million, $29.4 million and
$1.4 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Cash was used in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 for the
acquisition of businesses and assets, to acquire property and equipment, and
investments in affiliates, partially offset by the net proceeds from the sale
of marketable securities.

   Net cash used in financing activities was $8.8 million in the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2001. Net cash provided by financing activities was $13.6
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 and $36.1 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1999. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, the Company
paid $10.3 million of liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition of
Bottomline Europe. Net cash provided by financing activities in the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2000 included issuance of common stock to a company and proceeds
from the exercise of stock options. The net cash provided by financing
activities in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999 was primarily the result of
our initial public offering of common stock in February 1999.

   As of June 30, 2001 and 2000 we had net deferred tax assets of $0 and $2.8
million, respectively. The realizability of the net deferred tax assets at June
30, 2000 was deemed more likely than not as the net deferred tax assets could
be carried back to taxes paid in prior years. The valuation allowance increased
by $12.4 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 to reduce the net
deferred tax assets to zero since no such carryback is available.

   We believe that the cash generated from operations and cash and cash
equivalents and marketable securities on hand will be sufficient to meet our
working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. We also may
receive additional investments from, and make investments in, customers or
other companies.

                CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

   Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should
carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before making an
investment decision involving our common stock. The risks and uncertainties
described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and
uncertainties may also impair our business operations. If any of the following
risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of
operations would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common
stock could fall, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our
common stock.

The market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to be
subject to, extreme price and volume fluctuations

   Stock markets, in general, and The Nasdaq Stock Market in particular, have
experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Broad market fluctuations of
this type may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The market
price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to be subject to,
extreme fluctuations due to a variety of factors, including:

   .   public announcements concerning us, including announcements of
       litigation, our competitors or our industry;

   .   fluctuations in operating results;

   .   introductions of new products or services by us or our competitors;

   .   adverse developments in patent or other proprietary rights;

   .   changes in analysts' earnings estimates;

   .   announcements of technological innovations by our competitors; and

   .   general and industry-specific business, economic and market conditions.

The slowdown in the economy has affected the market for information technology
solutions, including our products and services, and our future financial
results will depend, in part, upon whether this slowdown continues

   As a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital
spending, demand for our products and services has been adversely affected. In
connection with the slowdown, we previously announced that we instituted
several cost reduction initiatives in order to improve our profitability,
including the reduction of U.S. headcount by approximately 10%, the elimination
of two group executive positions and the consolidation of two satellite
offices. If current economic conditions continue or worsen, we may experience a
material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial
condition.

Our fixed costs may lead to fluctuations in operating results if our revenues
are below expectations, and if our operating results are below external
expectations, the market price of our common stock may fall

   A significant percentage of our expenses, particularly personnel costs and
rent, are relatively fixed, and based in part on expectations of future
revenues. We may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate
for any significant fluctuations in revenues. Accordingly, shortfalls in
revenues may cause significant fluctuations in operating results in any
quarter.

   Quarterly operating results that are below the expectations of public market
analysts could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. Factors
that could cause these fluctuations include the following:

   .   the timing of orders and longer sales cycles, particularly due to any
       increase in average selling prices of our software solutions;

   .   economic conditions which may affect out customers' and potential
       customers' budgets for technological expenditures;

                                      32

<PAGE>

   .   the timing and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements
       by either us or our competitors;

   .   the timing of product implementations, which are highly dependent on
       customers' resources and discretion;

   .   the incurrence of costs relating to the integration of software products
       and operations in connection with acquisitions of technologies or
       businesses; and

   .   delivery interruptions relating to equipment and supplies purchased from
       third-party vendors, which could delay system sales.

   Because of these factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of
our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful.

A significant percentage of our revenues to date have come from our payment
management offerings and our performance will depend on continued market
acceptance of these offerings

   A significant percentage of our revenues to date have come from the license
and maintenance of our payment management offerings and sales of related
products and services. Any reduction in demand for our payment management
offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition. Our future performance will depend to a large
degree upon the market acceptance of our payment management offerings as a
payment management solution. Our prospects will also depend upon enterprises
seeking to enhance their payment functions to integrate electronic payment
capabilities. In addition, our future results will depend on the continued
market acceptance of desktop software for use in a departmental setting,
including our laser check printing solutions, as well as our ability to
introduce enhancements to meet the market's evolving needs for secure, payment
management solutions.

Our future financial results will depend upon continued market acceptance of
our NetTransact, BankQuest and iPoint product offerings

   If the NetTransact, BankQuest and iPoint products that we offer as the
result of our acquisitions do not continue to achieve market acceptance, our
future financial results will be adversely affected. We acquired the
NetTransact bill presentment software from The Northern Trust Company, a
financial institution, in July 1999. The NetTransact product was generally
available in February 2000. We acquired the web-based BankQuest cash management
software in our acquisition of Integrated Cash Management Services, Inc. in
October 1999. BankQuest was generally available in April 2000. Bottomline
Europe, which we acquired in August 2000, offers the iPoint solution, became
generally available in April 2000. If any of these products has any
unanticipated performance problems or bugs, or does not enjoy wide commercial
success, our long-term business strategy would be adversely affected.

Integration of acquisitions or strategic investments could disrupt our business
and our financial condition could be harmed

   We have made acquisitions of companies, including our acquisitions in fiscal
2001 of Bottomline Europe and Flashpoint, and we may acquire or make
investments in other businesses, products or technologies in the future. Any
future acquisitions or strategic investments, if any, may entail numerous risks
that include the following:

   .   difficulties in assimilating acquired operations, technologies or
       products;

   .   diversion of management's attention from our core business concerns;

   .   risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior
       experience;

   .   substantial dilution of our current stockholders' ownership;

   .   incurrence of substantial debt;

   .   incurrence of significant amortization expenses related to goodwill and
       other intangible assets; and

   .   incurrence of significant immediate write-offs.

   Any such difficulties encountered as a result of any mergers or acquisitions
could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

We face risks associated with our international operations that could harm our
financial condition and results of operations

   Our future growth rates and success are in part dependent on continued
growth and success in international markets. As is the case with most
international operations, the success and profitability of our international
operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that include, in
addition to the risks our business as a whole faces, the following:

   .   difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;

   .   certification requirements and differing regulatory and industry
       standards;

   .   reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;

   .   fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and

   .   import or export licensing requirements.

Increased competition may result in price reductions and decreased demand for
our products and services

   The market for bill presentment, payment and cash management software is
intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. Growing
competition may result in price reductions of our products and services,
reduced revenues and gross margins and loss of market share, any one of which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and
financial condition. Some competitors in our market have longer operating
histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other
resources, greater brand recognition and a larger installed customer base than
we do. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic
acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships to expand their product
offerings and to offer more comprehensive solutions. We also expect to face
additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the
market for payment management solutions.

Our success depends on our ability to develop new and enhanced software,
services and related products

   The bill presentment, payment and cash management software markets in which
we compete are subject to rapid technological change and our success is
dependent on our ability to develop new and enhanced software, services and
related products that meet our evolving market needs. Trends that could have a
critical impact on us include:

   .   rapidly changing technology that could require us to make our products
       compatible with new database or network systems;

   .   evolving industry standards and mandates, such as those mandated by the
       National Automated Clearing House Association, the Association for
       Payment Clearing Services and the Debt Collection Improvement Act of
       1996; and

   .   developments and changes relating to the Internet that we must address
       as we introduce new products.

   If we are unable to develop and introduce new products, or enhancements to
existing products, in a timely and successful manner, our business, operating
results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

We could become subject to litigation related to a future headquarters
facility, which could impact our business

   In recent weeks, we have been in discussions with the developer of a future
headquarters facility regarding the arrangements for our proposed occupancy. We
sought modifications to the lease, including a reduction in the amount of space
we would initially occupy, and the developer sought security for our
obligations under the lease. To date, we have not reached an agreement with the
developer modifying the terms of our occupancy nor have we provided any
additional security or assurances. There can, however, be no certainty that the
developer will

                                      34

<PAGE>

not elect to initiate litigation against us alleging defaults under our lease
or otherwise seeking financial assurances from us. We believe we would have
meritorious defenses to any claims made by the developer. Any such litigation
could, however, have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition.

Increased government regulation and legal uncertainties may impair the growth
of the Internet and decrease demand for our products and services

   The laws governing the Internet remain largely unsettled, even in areas
where there has been some legislative action. It may take years to determine
whether and how existing laws, including those governing intellectual property,
privacy, libel and taxation, apply to the Internet generally and to e-commerce
in particular.

   Legislation could limit the growth in the use of the Internet generally and
decrease the acceptance of the Internet as a communications and commercial
medium, which may decrease demand for our products and services and thus have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition.

Our success depends on the widespread adoption of the Internet and growth of
electronic business

   Our future success will in large part depend upon the willingness of
businesses and financial institutions to adopt the Internet as a medium of
e-business. These entities will probably accept this medium only if the
Internet provides substantially greater efficiency and enhances their
competitiveness. There are critical issues involved in the commercial use of
the Internet that are not yet fully resolved, including concerns regarding the
Internet's:

   .   security;

   .   reliability;

   .   ease of access; and

   .   quality of services.

   To the extent that any of these issues inhibit or limit the adoption of the
Internet as a medium of e-commerce, our business prospects could be adversely
affected. If electronic business does not continue to grow or grows more slowly
than expected, demand for our products and services may be reduced.

We must attract and retain highly skilled personnel with knowledge of
electronic payment and bill presentment technology and the banking industry

   We are dependent upon the ability to attract, hire, train and retain highly
skilled technical, sales and marketing, and support personnel, particularly
with expertise in electronic payment and bill presentment technology and
knowledge of the banking industry. Competition for qualified personnel is
intense. In addition, our corporate headquarters location in Portsmouth, New
Hampshire may limit our access to skilled personnel. Any failure to attract,
hire or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results and financial condition. Based on our experience,
it takes an average of nine months for a salesperson to become fully
productive. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in increasing the
productivity of our sales personnel, and the failure to do so could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition.

Rapid growth could strain our personnel, systems and controls

   In the past, rapid growth has strained our managerial and other resources.
Our ability to manage any future growth will depend in part on our ability to
continue to enhance our operating, financial and management information
systems. We cannot assure you that our personnel, systems and controls will be
adequate to support any future growth. If we are not able to manage growth
effectively, should it occur, the quality of our services, our ability to
retain key personnel and our business, operating results and financial
condition could be materially adversely affected.

                                      35

Our business can be adversely affected by problems with third-party hardware
that we resell

   Any problems with third-party hardware that we resell could harm our
customer relationships, industry credibility and financial condition. In a
prior fiscal year, we experienced a significant problem with a third-party
printer that we were then reselling which had a material adverse effect on our
operating results. Any repetition of these or similar problems with third party
hardware could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition.

We depend on a few key employees who are skilled in e-commerce, payment and
bill presentment methodology and Internet and other technologies

   Our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers
and key technical employees who are skilled in e-commerce, payment methodology
and regulation, and Internet, database and network technologies. We currently
do not maintain "key man" life insurance policies on any of our employees.
While some of our executive officers have employment agreements with us, the
loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees
could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and
financial condition.

Undetected bugs in our software could adversely affect the performance of our
software and demand for our products

   Our software products could contain errors or "bugs" that we have not been
able to detect which could adversely affect their performance and reduce demand
for our products. Any defects or errors in new products, such as NetTransact,
BankQuest or iPoint, or enhancements could harm our customer relationships and
result in negative publicity regarding us and our products, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition.

Our business could be subject to product liability claims

   Because our software and hardware products are designed to provide critical
payment management, invoicing and cash management functions, we may be subject
to significant product liability claims. Our insurance may not be sufficient to
cover us against these claims or may not be available at all. A product
liability claim brought against us, even if not successful, could require us to
spend significant time and money in litigation. As a result, any such claim,
whether successful or not, could seriously damage our reputation and harm our
business, operating results and financial condition.

Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our
proprietary technology

   We rely upon a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws and
non-disclosure and other intellectual property contractual arrangements to
protect our proprietary rights. However, we cannot assure you that our patents,
pending applications that may be issued in the future, or other intellectual
property will be of sufficient scope and strength to provide meaningful
protection of our technology or any commercial advantage to us, or that the
patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We enter into
agreements with our employees and clients that seek to limit and protect the
distribution of proprietary information. We cannot assure you that the steps we
have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to
deter misappropriation of proprietary information, and we may not be able to
detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual
property rights.

We could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights,
which could seriously harm our business

   In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States
involving patents and other intellectual property rights. We may be a party to
litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or as

                                      36

<PAGE>

a result of an alleged infringement of the intellectual property of others.
These claims could require us to spend significant sums in litigation, pay
damages, delay product installments, develop non-infringing intellectual
property or acquire licenses to intellectual property that is the subject of
the infringement claim. These claims could have a material adverse effect on
our business, operating results and financial condition.

We may incur significant costs from class action litigation due to the expected
volatility of our common stock

   In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price
of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation. In
August 2001, we were named in a securities class action litigation. We could
incur substantial costs and experience a diversion of our management's
attention and resources in connection with such litigation and it could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

   Our exposure to financial risk, including changes in interest rates, relates
primarily to cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. These
investments bear interest at a variable interest rate, which is subject to
market changes. We have not entered into any interest rate swap agreements, or
other instruments to minimize our exposure to interest rate increases. We have
not had any derivative instruments in the past and do not presently plan to in
the future.

   For purposes of specific risk analysis we use sensitivity analysis to
determine the impacts that market risk exposure may have on the fair value of
our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. To perform the
sensitivity analysis, we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the impact
of hypothetical changes in interest rates on market sensitive instruments. We
compare the market values for interest risk based on the present value of
future cash flows as impacted by the changes in the rates. We selected discount
rates for the present value computations based on market interest rates in
effect at June 30, 2001. We compared the market values resulting from these
computations with the market values of these financial instruments at June 30,
2001. The differences in the comparison are the hypothetical gains or losses
associated with each type of risk.

   Our investment portfolio consists of demand deposit accounts, a money market
mutual fund and investment accounts. Due to the short-term average maturity of
the investment portfolio, a sudden sharp change in interest rates would not
have a material adverse effect on the value of the portfolio. Based on our
investment portfolio and interest rates, a 100 basis point increase or decrease
in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately
$400,000, $385,000 and $132,000 for the fiscal years ended 1999, 2000 and 2001,
respectively, in our results from operations and cash flows.

   A portion of our operations is located in the United Kingdom, where the
local currency is British Pound Sterling (the Pound). Although the Pound has
not historically experienced significant fluctuations over short periods of
time, our financial results could be significantly affected by changes in
foreign currency exchange rates. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the
exchange rate between the Pound and the dollar would result in an increase or
decrease to revenue and net income, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, of
approximately $265,000 and $215,000, respectively.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors and Stockholders
Bottomline Technologies (de), Inc.

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bottomline
Technologies (de), Inc. as of June 30, 2000 and 2001, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive
loss, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,
2001. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule
listed in the index at Item 14 (a). These financial statements and schedule are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Bottomline
Technologies (de), Inc. at June 30, 2000 and 2001, and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended June 30, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related consolidated
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                    Year Ended June 30, 1999, 2000 and 2001

1. Organization and Nature of Business

   Bottomline Technologies (de), Inc. (the Company) was originally incorporated
as a New Hampshire corporation in 1989 and was reincorporated as a Delaware
corporation in August 1997. The Company's suite of Financial Resource
Management (FRM) offerings enables businesses and financial institutions to
manage their critical financial transactions, cash decisions and trading
partner financial relationships, leveraging the Internet. The Company's
products and services are sold to customers operating in many different
industries throughout the world.

2. Significant Accounting Policies

  Principles of Consolidation

   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

  Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements

   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Estimates include, but are not limited to,
the allowances for doubtful accounts and returns and accrued liabilities.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  Foreign Currency Translation

   The Company has a non-U.S. subsidiary whose local and functional currency is
the British Pound Sterling. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of this
subsidiary are translated into dollars at year-end exchange rates, and
statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rates during
the year. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency translations are
included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents

   Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposit accounts, a money market
mutual fund and an overnight investment account at a financial institution. The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of
ninety days or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of these
instruments approximates their fair value.

  Marketable Securities

   The Company accounts for marketable securities in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities" (SFAS 115). SFAS 115 establishes the accounting
and reporting requirements for all debt securities and for investments in
equity securities that have readily determinable fair values. All marketable
securities must be classified as one of the following: held-to-maturity,
available-for-sale, or trading. The Company classifies its marketable
securities as available-for-sale and, as such, carries the investments at fair
value, with unrealized holding gains and losses included in accumulated other
comprehensive loss.

  Concentration of Credit Risk

   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities, and accounts receivable. The Company had approximately $13,247,000
of cash and cash equivalents invested with two financial institutions at June
30, 2001.

                                      51

<PAGE>

                      BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES (de), INC.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

The Company invests its excess cash and cash equivalents in high quality
marketable securities. Concentration of credit risk with respect to marketable
securities is limited as the Company's marketable securities are primarily
investment-grade corporate bonds with high-quality credit financial
institutions.

   Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited
due to the large number of companies and diverse industries comprising the
Company's customer base. One unaffiliated customer accounted for 13% of the
Company's total accounts receivable as of June 30, 2001. A customer and
stockholder of the Company accounted for 14% of total accounts receivable as of
June 30, 2000. On-going credit evaluations of customers' financial condition
are performed and collateral is generally not required. The Company maintains
reserves for potential credit losses and such losses, in the aggregate, have
not exceeded management's expectations.

  Financial Instruments

   The fair value of the Company's financial instruments, which include cash
and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and accounts
payable are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated
future cash flows and assumed discount rates reflecting varying degrees of
perceived risk. The carrying value of these financial instruments approximated
their fair value at June 30, 2000 and 2001, respectively, due to the short-term
nature of these instruments.

  Inventory

   Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or
market.

  Property, Plant and Equipment

   Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated
amortization and depreciation. Property and equipment are depreciated on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (three to six
years). Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets (fifty years). Leasehold improvements are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the
asset or the lease term.

  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

   Goodwill and other intangible assets represent core technology, customer
lists, trade name, contract backlog, assembled workforce and goodwill recorded
in connection with acquisitions. As a result of such acquisitions, accounted
for as purchase business combinations and the purchase of assets, the Company
recorded intangible assets based on the excess of the purchase price over the
identifiable tangible assets acquired on the date of purchase. Intangible
assets are reported at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and are being
amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to five years.

   The carrying value of intangible assets is periodically reviewed by the
Company based on the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows of the
related asset. If an impairment is indicated or occurs, the Company will adjust
the carrying value of the intangible assets.

  Advertising Costs

   The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were
$136,000, $358,000 and $460,000 for the years ended June 30, 1999, 2000 and
2001, respectively.

  Income Taxes

   Deferred income taxes are provided for differences in bases of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Temporary
differences relate primarily to acquisition-related intangibles, depreciation,

                                      52

                      BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES (de), INC.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

various accruals, and allowances for doubtful accounts, returns and inventory.
The principal non-deductible expenses relate to the issuance of warrants during
fiscal year 2000 and certain non-deductible acquisition-related intangibles.
The principal non-deductible expense for fiscal year 2001 is intangible asset
amortization associated with business acquisitions.

  Stock-Based Compensation

   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation" (SFAS 123) encourages, but does not require,
companies to record compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation
plans at fair value. The Company has elected to continue to account for stock
based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and
related Interpretations.

   Prior to the Company's initial public offering on February 12, 1999, the
Board of Directors determined the fair value of the Company's common stock in
its good faith judgment at each option grant date for grants under the equity
plans. In determining the fair value, the Board of Directors considered a
number of factors, including the financial and operating performance of the
Company, recent transactions in the Company's common stock, if any, the values
of similarly situated companies and the lack of liquidity of the Company's
common stock.

  Capitalized and Acquired Software Costs

   Capitalization of software development costs under SFAS No. 86 begins upon
the establishment of technological feasibility. In the development of our
products and enhancements to existing products, the technological feasibility
of the software is not established until substantially all product development
is complete, including the development of a working model. The establishment of
technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of recoverability of
capitalized software development costs require considerable judgment by
management with respect to certain external factors, including, but not limited
to, technological feasibility, anticipated future gross revenues, estimated
economic life, and changes in software and hardware technologies. For the years
ended June 30, 1999, 2000 and 2001 there were no costs capitalized since all
costs were incurred prior to attaining technological feasibility.

  Revenue Recognition

   In October 1997, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the
American Institute (AcSEC) of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of
Position (SOP) 97-2 "Software Revenue Recognition", which was adopted effective
July 1, 1998. SOP 98-4, "Deferral of the Effective Date of a Provision of SOP
97-2, Software Revenue Recognition" deferred the effective date of certain
aspects of SOP 97-2. Effective December 15, 1998, SOP 98-9 was issued which
amended SOP 98-4 and extended the deferral of the application of certain
passages of SOP 97-2 to transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning
after March 15, 1999. These statements superseded SOP 91-1, "Software Revenue
Recognition," and provide guidance on applying generally accepted accounting
principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions entered into in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. The adoption of SOP 97-2, as
amended by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9, did not have a material impact on the
Company's revenues and results of operations.

   Consistent with SOP 97-2, revenue recognition from software license fees is
recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the
product has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is
probable. The Company's software arrangements may contain multiple revenue
elements, such as software products, services, hardware and post-contract
customer support (PCS). Revenue earned on software arrangements involving
multiple elements which qualify for separate element treatment is allocated to
each element based on the relative fair values of those elements based on
vendor specific objective evidence. For the years ended June 30, 2000 and 2001,
vendor specific objective evidence is limited to the price charged when the

                                      53

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

element is sold separately or, for an element not yet being sold separately,
the price established by management having the relevant authority. Revenue for
services is recognized as the services are provided to the customer. Revenue
for PCS under software maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the
term of the agreement, generally one year. Revenue for hardware is recognized
when the product is delivered.

   Certain software development arrangements requiring significant
customization and modifications and extended implementation periods are
accounted for using percentage of completion contract accounting as defined by
Statement of Position No. 81-1 ("SOP 81-1"), "Accounting for Performance of
Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts". Under SOP 81-1,
revenue is recognized based on the costs incurred during the reporting period
as a percentage of the estimated total contract costs.

   In December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements, or SAB 101. SAB 101 summarizes certain of
the SEC's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue
recognition in financial statements. In October 2000, the SEC issued further
guidance with respect to adoption of specific issues addressed by SAB 101. The
Company adopted SAB 101 effective July 1, 2000. The adoption of SAB 101 did not
have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

   In September 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues
Task Force (EITF) published its consensus on EITF No. 00-10, "Accounting for
Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs", which requires that all shipping and
handling amounts billed to a customer be classified as revenue. The Company
adopted EITF 00-10 effective April 1, 2001. Prior to adoption, the Company had
recorded such amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. Financial statements for
prior periods presented for comparative purposes have been reclassified to
comply with the classification guidelines of EITF 00-10. (See Note 14.)

  Customer Returns

   The sales value of customer returns are estimated and accrued for based upon
return authorizations issued and past history.

  Earnings per Share

   The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 "Earnings Per Share" (SFAS 128). SFAS
128 requires calculation and presentation of basic and diluted earnings per
share. Basic earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding and excludes any dilutive effects of
warrants, stock options or other type of convertible securities. Diluted
earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding and the dilutive effect of stock options, warrants and other
types of convertible securities calculated using the treasury stock method.
Dilutive securities are excluded from the diluted earnings per share
calculation if their effect is anti-dilutive.

  401(k) and Pension Plans

   The Company has a 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (the Plan), whereby eligible
employees may contribute up to 15% of their compensation, subject to
limitations established by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company may
contribute a discretionary matching contribution annually equal to 50% (30% in
1999) of each such participant's deferred compensation up to 5% of their annual
compensation. The Company charged $129,000, $294,000 and $502,000 to expense in
the years ended 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively, under the Plan.

   The Company has a Group Personal Pension Plan (GPPP) for employees in the
U.K., whereby eligible employees may contribute a portion of their
compensation, subject to their age and other limitations established

                                      54

                      BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES (de), INC.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

by the Inland Revenue. The Company contributes 1.5% of the employee's annual
compensation for those employees who make personal contributions of at least 1%
of their annual earnings. The Company charged $75,000 to expense in the year
ended June 30, 2001, under the GPPP.

  Comprehensive Income (Loss)

   The Company computes comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 130 (SFAS 130), "Reporting
Comprehensive Income". SFAS 130 establishes standards for the reporting and
display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements.
Comprehensive income, as defined, includes all changes in equity during a
period from non-owner sources, such as foreign currency translation adjustments
and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. Comprehensive
income was equal to net income for the year ended June 30, 1999 since there
were no elements of comprehensive income.

  Accounting Pronouncements

   In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. These standards, among other
things, eliminate the pooling of interests method of accounting for future
acquisitions and require that goodwill no longer be amortized, but instead be
subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis. SFAS No. 141 was
effective for all business combinations completed after June 30, 2001.

   SFAS No. 142 must be adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001 (fiscal 2003 for the Company). Under the provision of SFAS No. 142,
intangible assets with definite useful lives will be amortized to their
estimable residual values over those estimated useful lives in proportion to
the economic benefits consumed. Such intangible assets remain subject to the
impairment provisions of SFAS No. 121. Goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives will be tested for impairment annually in lieu of being
amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001 will
continue to be amortized until adoption of SFAS No. 142.

   Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, we will cease our annual amortization of
goodwill. The Company's current annual amortization of goodwill is
approximately $24 million. The Company currently plans to adopt SFAS No. 142
effective July 1, 2002.

  Reclassifications

   Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.

3. Product and Business Acquisitions

   The Company has made five acquisitions since July 1999, all of which have
been accounted for as purchases. The results of operations for each have been
included with those of the Company for all periods subsequent to the date of
acquisition.

  NetTransact

   In July 1999, the Company acquired certain software and related proprietary
intellectual property, NetTransact, from The Northern Trust Company for an
aggregate of $3,800,000 in cash and acquisition costs. NetTransact allows for
the electronic presentment and payment of invoices and related dispute
resolution in a business-to-business environment. In connection with this
product acquisition, the Company recorded a $1,300,000 charge for acquired
in-process research and development and $2,500,000 of intangible assets,
consisting of core technology and goodwill, that is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over a five-year period. In connection with the
acquisition, the Company is obligated to pay The Northern Trust Company a 10%

                                      55

                      BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES (de), INC.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

royalty on all NetTransact revenue related to the software and certain other
property acquired from The Northern Trust Company excluding the initial
$3,500,000 in such revenues. The Company began paying such royalties to The
Northern Trust Company in the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2000.

  Integrated Cash Management Services, Inc.

   In October 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and
assumed certain liabilities of Integrated Cash Management Services, Inc.
("ICM") for an aggregate of $9,300,000 in cash and acquisition costs. In
connection with this asset acquisition, the Company recorded a $2,600,000
charge for acquired in-process research and development. The Company recorded
$6,700,000 of intangible assets consisting of core technology, contract
backlog, assembled workforce and goodwill. The intangible assets are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging
from one to five years.

  OLC Software, Inc.

   In February 2000, the Company acquired all outstanding shares of stock of
OLC Software, Inc. ("OLC") for an aggregate purchase price of $1,500,000 in
cash and acquisition costs. OLC was an early stage development company with
limited operations prior to the acquisition. In connection with this
acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill that is being amortized over its
useful life of three years.

  Checkpoint Holdings, Ltd.

   In August 2000, the Company acquired all outstanding shares of stock of
Checkpoint Holdings, Ltd. (doing business as Bottomline Europe). Checkpoint, a
private company incorporated in England and Wales, is a provider of electronic
commerce and electronic payment software for the United Kingdom. The
acquisition was completed pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated August
28, 2000, as amended, between the Company and Checkpoint stockholders. The
consideration for the acquisition was approximately $60,100,000, consisting of
$4,700,000 in cash, $19,800,000 in loan notes, which, as described in Note 8,
were subsequently redeemed, 1,013,333 shares of the Company's common stock,
warrants to purchase a total of 100,000 shares of common stock at an exercise
price of $50.00 per share and payment of transaction costs. At June 30, 2001,
none of the warrants had been exercised and all such warrants expire in August
2005. The Company valued the warrants issued using the Black-Scholes method
using assumptions of an expected life of three years and a volatility of 91%.
In connection with the acquisition, 336,667 shares of the Company's common
stock were issued to satisfy pre-existing loan note obligations of Checkpoint
in the amount of $10,272,000. As a result of the acquisition and the
preliminary allocation of the purchase price, intangible assets of
approximately $79,800,000 (as measured at exchange rates in effect at the date
of acquisition) were recorded consisting of customer list, contract backlog,
assembled workforce, core technology, trade name and goodwill. Adjustments will
be made to the purchase price allocations if changes to the preliminary
assessments occur prior to August 28, 2001. Adjustments to the purchase price
have been recorded; the net effect of the adjustments had no material impact on
the purchase price in the aggregate. The intangible assets are reported at
cost, net of accumulated amortization, and are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from ten months
to three years.

  Flashpoint, Inc.

   In August 2000, the Company acquired all outstanding shares of stock of
Flashpoint, Inc. ("Flashpoint"). Flashpoint, a Massachusetts corporation, is a
developer of Web-based software. The acquisition was completed pursuant to a
Stock Purchase Agreement dated August 28, 2000 by and among the Company,
Flashpoint, and the sole stockholder of Flashpoint. The consideration for the
acquisition was approximately $16,800,000, consisting of $4,500,000 in cash,
242,199 shares of the Company's common stock, the assumption of all outstanding
stock options of Flashpoint and payment of transaction costs. As a result of
the acquisition and the preliminary allocation of the purchase price,
intangible assets of approximately $16,700,000 were recorded consisting of
contract backlog, assembled workforce and goodwill. Adjustments will be made to
the purchase price allocations if changes to the preliminary assessments occur
prior to August 28, 2001. The intangible assets are reported at

cost, net of accumulated amortization, and are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from ten months
to three years.

  In-Process Research and Development

   In connection with the acquisitions of the NetTransact product and the ICM
net assets, the Company recorded in-process research and development charges of
an aggregate of $3,900,000, representing purchased in-process research and
development that had not reached technological feasibility. The Company's
management made certain assessments with respect to the determination of all
identifiable assets resulting from, or to be used in, research and development
activities as of the respective acquisition dates.

   In the NetTransact product and ICM net asset acquisitions, the in-process
research and development projects were valued using an income approach, which
included the application of a discounted future earnings methodology. Using
this methodology, the value of the in-process technology is comprised of the
total present value of the future earnings stream attributable to the
technology throughout its anticipated life. As a basis for the valuation
process, the Company made estimates of the revenue stream to be generated in
each future period and the corresponding operating expenses and other charges
to apply to this revenue stream. In order to determine the value of the
earnings stream that was specifically attributable to the in-process
technology, the earnings attributable to the projects were calculated by
deducting the earnings streams attributable to all other assets, including
working capital and tangible assets. Based upon these assumptions, the future
after-tax income streams relating to the in-process technologies were
discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate that reflected
the uncertainty involved in successfully completing and commercializing the
in-process technologies.

   The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the
combined results of operations of the Company, ICM, Bottomline Europe and
Flashpoint as if the acquisitions had occurred as of the beginning of fiscal
2000 and 2001, after giving effect to certain adjustments, including
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets. The pro forma financial
information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations that would
have occurred had the Company, ICM, Bottomline Europe and Flashpoint been a
single entity during such period. Since NetTransact was a product acquisition
and OLC had very limited operations prior to the acquisition, no amounts are
included in the pro forma information below for these acquisitions.

   Upon acquiring Flashpoint, the Company ceased providing services to
Flashpoint's third-party customers after completion of existing projects. The
resources providing those services were transitioned to Bottomline product
development. Accordingly, the pro forma revenue shown above for fiscal year
2001 reflects only the completion of existing projects.

4. Marketable Securities

   Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported
at fair value based on quoted market prices with net unrealized gains or losses
excluded from earnings and reported as a component of other comprehensive loss.
Interest income and realized gains and losses are recognized when earned. There
were no marketable securities at June 30, 2001. The carrying amounts of the
Company's marketable securities at June 30, 2000 are as follows:

7. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

   The Company leases its principal office facility under a non-cancelable
operating lease expiring in 2002. In addition to the base term, the Company has
two five-year options to extend the term of the lease. Rent payments are fixed
for the initial two years of the lease and may be increased after that during
the initial term of the lease by the Consumer Price Index. In addition, the
Company is obligated to pay certain incremental operating costs over the base
amount.

   In August 2000, the Company entered into a non-cancelable operating lease
expiring in fiscal year 2012 for a new headquarters facility. In addition to
the base term, the Company has the option to extend the term of the lease by
two five-year options. Rent payments are set for the term of the lease,
including increases each year. The Company is additionally obligated to pay
specific incremental operating expenses over the base rent. The lease
obligation is scheduled to begin in conjunction with occupancy in October 2001.

   The Company also leases office space in other cities worldwide. All such
leases expire by fiscal year 2010.

   Rent expense charged to operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1999,
2000 and 2001 was $454,000, $944,000 and $1,859,000 respectively.

8. Notes Payable and Credit Facility

   In connection with the acquisition of Bottomline Europe, the Company issued
promissory notes with an aggregate value of $20,356,000, of which $579,000 of
loan notes were issued to satisfy pre-existing loan note obligations of
Bottomline Europe. Under their original terms, the promissory notes, including
accrued interest thereon, were scheduled to mature on August 28, 2001. Prior to
the maturity date, the Company had the right to repay the promissory notes,
including accrued interest, in cash. On the maturity date, the Company had the
option to repay the promissory notes, including accrued interest, in cash, the
Company's common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. If all of the
promissory notes or a portion thereof were paid with the Company's common
stock, the number of shares to be issued was to be calculated as the amount of
promissory notes to be repaid divided by a fixed per share stock price of
$30.77. The promissory notes accrued interest at a rate of 10% for the period
beginning on August 28, 2000 and ending on February 28, 2001 and at a rate of
14% for the period beginning on February 28, 2001 and ending on August 28,
2001.

   In April 2001, the Company and the promissory note holders agreed to retire
the promissory notes and accrued interest thereon in exchange for the issuance
of 732,798 shares of the Company's common stock, based on a conversion price of
$29.25 per share. Under the terms of the agreement, promissory note holders
will be entitled to a contingent payment of up to $10 million in the event of a
merger or acquisition closed by August 28, 2001, in which the value of the
Company's common stock is less than $30 per share. Retirement of the notes was
accounted for as an equity transaction with the outstanding balance credited to
additional paid-in capital.

   Bottomline Europe has an overdraft facility for up to 1,000,000 British
Pound Sterling through February 28, 2002. The overdraft facility is
collateralized by eligible Bottomline Europe receivables.

9. Stockholders' Equity

  Common Stock

   In June 2000, the Company issued 307,882 shares of common stock for
aggregate consideration of $9,951,000, net of expenses. In connection with the
equity investment, the Company also issued a warrant for the purchase of
307,882 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $38.00 per share. The
Company valued the warrant issued using the Black-Scholes method using
assumptions of an expected life of three years and a volatility of 91%. The
proceeds of the sale of the common stock and warrant were allocated to each
based on the relative fair value resulting in a charge to operations of
$6,041,000. The warrant was fully vested and exercisable upon issuance. At June
30, 2001 the warrant had not been exercised, and such warrant will expire in
June 2003.

   The Company has 6,364,108 common shares reserved for future issuance with
respect to stock options, the Company's employee stock purchase plan and
warrants.

Equity Plans

Stock Incentive Plans

  1989 Stock Option Plan

   The Company adopted the Bottomline Technologies, Inc. Stock Option Plan, as
amended, (the Plan) on August 1, 1989, which provides for the issuance of
incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options. The Plan is
administered by the Board of Directors, which has the authority to determine to
whom options may be granted, the period of exercise and what other
restrictions, if any, should apply. Vesting for options granted under the Plan
is principally over three years from the date of the grant. The Company
reserved 1,440,000 shares of its common stock for issuance under the Plan.
Incentive stock options may be granted to employees at a price of no less than
100% of the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant. Options
expire a maximum of ten years from the date of grant. The Company no longer
issues options under this plan.

  1997 Stock Incentive Plan

   On August 21, 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan (the
1997 Plan), which provides for the issuance of stock options and nonstatutory
stock options. The 1997 Plan is administered by the Board of Directors which
has the authority to determine to whom options may be granted, the period of
exercise and what other restrictions, if any, should apply. Vesting for options
granted under the 1997 Plan is principally over four years from the date of the
grant. The Company reserved 2,700,000 shares of its common stock for issuance
under the 1997 Plan to employees at a price of no less than 100% of the fair
market value of the common stock at the date of grant. Options expire a maximum
of ten years from the date of grant. The Company no longer issues options under
this plan.

  1998 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan

   On November 12, 1998, the Company adopted the 1998 Non-Employee Director
Stock Option Plan (the Director Plan), which provides for the issuance of
non-statutory stock options. The Company has reserved up to 300,000 shares of
its common stock for issuance under the Director Plan. Under the terms of the
Director Plan, each non-employee director is granted an option to purchase
15,000 shares of common stock upon his or her initial election to the Board of
Directors. Such options vest ratably over four years from the date of the
grant. Additionally, each non-employee director is granted an option to
purchase 7,500 shares of common stock at each annual meeting of stockholders
following the annual meeting of the initial year of the election. Such options
principally vest over one year from the date of the grant. At June 30, 2001,
60,000 options were outstanding under this plan.

  2000 Employee Stock Incentive Plan

   On November 16, 2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Employee Stock Incentive
Plan (the 2000 Plan), which provides for the issuance of stock options and
non-statutory stock options. The 2000 Plan is administered by the Board of
Directors which has the authority to determine to whom options may be granted,
the period of exercise and what other restrictions, if any, should apply.
Vesting for options granted under the 2000 Plan is principally over four years
from the date of the grant. The Company initially reserved 1,350,000 shares of
its common stock for issuance under the 2000 Plan.

   On the first day of each fiscal year, beginning in fiscal year 2001 and
ending in fiscal year 2010, the number of shares of common stock authorized for
issuance under the 2000 Plan will automatically increase, without additional
Board or stockholder approvals. The number of shares authorized for issuance
will increase, when added to the remaining available shares, to total an amount
equal to 12% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the first
day of the fiscal year, or a lesser number as the Board of Directors may
determine prior to such increase. The annual increase can never exceed
5,000,000 shares. In addition, 800,000 shares of

                                      62

common stock reserved for issuance under the 1997 Plan, which have not been
issued or which have been terminated or otherwise surrendered, will be
available for issuance under the 2000 Plan. Stock options issued under the 2000
Plan must be issued at a price no less than 100% of the fair market value of
the common stock at the date of grant. On July 1, 2001, 1,619,992 additional
shares were authorized for issuance under the 2000 Plan. At June 30, 2001,
1,875,000 options were outstanding under this plan.

  Flashpoint Employee Stock Option Plan

   On August 28, 2000 the Company adopted the Flashpoint Employee Stock Option
Plan (the Flashpoint Plan) as part of the acquisition of Flashpoint. Included
in the acquisition was the assumption of all outstanding stock options of
Flashpoint, which were issued under the Flashpoint Plan. At June 30, 2001,
124,000 options were outstanding under this plan. At June 30, 2001 there were
23,300 shares available for grant under the Flashpoint Plan. The Company does
not intend to grant such options.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

  1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

   On November 12, 1998, the Company adopted the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the Stock Purchase Plan), which provides for the issuance of up to a
total of 750,000 shares of common stock to participating employees. Eligible
employees may contribute between 1% and 10% of their base pay to the Stock
Purchase Plan. At the end of a designated offering period, employees purchase
shares of the Company's common stock with their contributions at an amount
equal to 85% of the closing market price per share of the common stock on
either the first day or the last day of the offering period, whichever is
lower. The Company no longer issues shares under this plan.

  2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

   On November 16, 2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (2000 Stock Purchase Plan), which provides for the issuance of up to a
total of 750,000 shares of common stock to participating employees. Eligible
employees may contribute between 1% and 10% of their base pay to the 2000 Stock
Purchase Plan. At the end of a designated offering period, employees purchase
shares of the Company's common stock with their contributions at an amount
equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the
first day of each 24 month offering period and the last day of the applicable
six month purchase period.

  Stock-Based Compensation

   The Company has elected to follow APB 25, and related interpretations in
accounting for its employee stock options because, as discussed below, the
alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS 123 requires the use
of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee
stock options. Under APB 25, as the exercise price of the Company's employee
stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of
grant, no compensation expense is recognized.

   Option valuation models have been developed for use in estimating the fair
value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. Such models require the input of highly subjective assumptions.
Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single

   For purposes of the required pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value

cost for the Company's stock option plan been determined based on the fair
value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with the
Black-Scholes method subsequent to the Company's initial public offering in
February 1999 and the minimum value method prior to February 1999, the

Warrants

   In April 2000, the Company issued warrants to a company for the right to
purchase up to 324,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $55.00
per share. The warrants were fully vested and exercisable upon issuance. The
Company valued the warrants issued using the Black-Scholes method using
assumptions of an expected life of three years and a volatility of 91%. The
value of the warrants, $5,861,000, was charged to the results of operations in
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000. At June 30, 2001, none of these warrants
had been exercised and all such warrants expire in April 2003.

</TABLE>

   SFAS 109 requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets
reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not,
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. After
consideration of all the evidence, both positive and negative, management has
determined the deferred tax assets are less likely, rather than more likely, to
be realized. Accordingly, management has recorded a full valuation allowance of
$14,769,000 for its deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2001. The change in the
valuation allowance for the current year is $12,441,000.

   At June 30, 2001, the Company has available net US operating loss
carry-forwards of $4,619,000, which expire in the year 2021. The Company also
has $2,066,000 of foreign net operating losses available.

   In addition to the above deferred tax assets, the Company also has available
$1,525,000 of tax benefit attributable to the exercise of non-qualified stock
options. When realized, the associated benefit will be recognized as an
increase to additional paid-in capital.

13. Subsequent Events

   From time to time the Company may be named in claims arising in the ordinary
course of business. On August 10, 2001, a class action complaint was filed
against the Company and the underwriters of the Company's initial public
offering in 1999. The complaint asserts, among other things, that the
description in the prospectus for the initial public offering was materially
false and misleading in describing the compensation to be earned by the
underwriters of the offering, and in not describing certain alleged
arrangements among underwriters and initial purchasers of the common stock from
the underwriters. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against such
complaint. While this proceeding is in its early stages, the Company does not
currently believe that the outcome will have a materially adverse impact on its
financial condition

   On September 17, 2001 the Company's Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $3 million of the Company's common stock from time to time
on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.

Dear Dan:

   Reference is made to your employment agreement with Bottomline Technologies
(de), Inc. (the "Company") dated as of December 3, 1998 (the "Agreement").

   By delivery and execution of this letter, the Company hereby agrees to
continue the Agreement for an additional 24-month period commencing December 3,
2001 and ending on December 3, 2003, unless sooner terminated in accordance
with the provisions of Section 5 of the Agreement. For all purposes of the
Agreement, such extension shall be deemed a portion of the Employment Period,
as defined in the Agreement.

   In all respects, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, as so
extended, provided, however, that:

   1.It is agreed and acknowledged that your current titles, for purposes of
     the Agreement, are Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and
     that the first sentence of Section 2 of the Agreement is hereby amended
     accordingly.

   2.It is further agreed that your current annual base salary is $270,000, and
     that Section3.1 of the Agreement is hereby amended accordingly. Further
     salary, bonus and option adjustments may be made from time to time in
     accordance with the terms of the Agreement as so extended.

   3.It is further agreed that in the event of the termination of your
     employment with the Company other than for "cause", as defined in the
     Agreement, (i) all options held by you shall immediately vest and (ii) you
     shall have a period of two years (or the remainder of the option term if
     less than two years) after the date of termination to exercise all options
     you hold; provided, however, the automatic vesting under this particular
     provision shall not apply to any prior grant of options at a strike price
     less than the closing price of Bottomline's stock on the date hereof,
     unless subsequently provided for at a later date by a vote of the Board or
     the Compensation Committee.

   By execution of this letter, you hereby agree to the foregoing extension of
the Agreement, and reaffirm your obligations under the Agreement.

                                          Very truly yours,

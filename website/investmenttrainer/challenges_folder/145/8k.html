             GENCORP COMPLETES SPIN-OFF OF POLYMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT;
                         ANNOUNCES NEW MANAGEMENT TEAM

         SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA, OCTOBER 4, 1999 (NYSE:GY) - GenCorp announced
today that it has completed the spin-off of its Performance Chemicals and
Decorative & Building Products businesses. As a result of the spin-off, the
company has moved its headquarters to Sacramento, next to its principal
aerospace and defense segment, Aerojet. Other businesses in GenCorp's
much-simplified portfolio include a growing Aerojet Fine Chemicals subsidiary
serving the pharmaceutical industry, and an automotive Vehicle Sealing unit,
which supplies major automakers in the U.S. and Europe.

         GenCorp remains listed on the New York Stock Exchange as GY.
 "The spin-off opens an exciting new chapter for GenCorp, with renewed
opportunity to enhance value for our shareholders," said the company's new
Chairman and CEO, Bob Wolfe, who has served for the past two years as President
of Aerojet. "It strengthens our ability to focus attention and resources on
growth in high potential markets such as

commercial space electronics and pharmaceutical fine chemicals, drive needed
consolidation in industries including space propulsion, and implement
significant company-wide internal improvements."

         Mr. Wolfe was named to head GenCorp as Chairman and CEO at completion
of the spin-off when the plan was first announced in December. A seasoned
veteran of the aerospace and defense industry, he has held numerous executive
leadership positions. He joined GenCorp in 1997 from the Pratt & Whitney
division of United Technologies, where he served as President for the Large
Commercial Engine sector, and earlier as Executive Vice President of Pratt &
Whitney's Government and Space Propulsion business.

         Prior to Pratt & Whitney, Mr. Wolfe held key positions at Martin
Marietta, and McDonnell Douglas Corporation. Mr. Wolfe has led a series of
initiatives at Aerojet that have resulted in a significant trend of improved
operational and financial performance.

         Carl B. Fischer has been named President of Aerojet, succeeding Mr.
Wolfe. Formerly, the Senior Vice President of Aerojet's Electronic Weapon
Systems sector, Mr. Fischer has overseen the growth of this largest Aerojet
sector since 1997. Aerojet has benefited from Mr. Fischer's wealth of experience
and expertise for over 30 years.

         As previously announced, Terry L. Hall has assumed the position of
Senior Vice President and CFO for GenCorp. Mr. Hall joined the company earlier
this year from U.S. Airways where he was CFO. Among other executive leadership
positions, Mr. Hall has served as CFO for Apogee Enterprises, Inc., and for Tyco
International, and brings to GenCorp a broad base of expertise in all facets of
corporate financing, tax, audit, and treasury, as well as mergers and
acquisitions.

         Robert G. Miotke will continue in his current capacity as President of
Aerojet Fine Chemicals. Mr. Miotke joined Aerojet in 1996 to drive the
successful start up and growth of this new commercial business enterprise. He
holds a progressive record of U.S. and international sales and management
experience in fine and specialty chemical industries.

         Robert L. Calder will remain President of GenCorp's automotive Vehicle
Sealing unit, a position he has held since 1998. Mr. Calder was previously the
Executive Vice President of TG North America, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Toyota Motor Company.

         With over $1 billion in sales and nearly 8,000 employees worldwide,
GenCorp holds leading positions in the aerospace and defense, fine chemicals and
automotive industries.

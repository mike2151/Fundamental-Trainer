                  7.2      By the Seller. The Seller further agrees to indemnify
                           -------------
and hold harmless the Buyer from any and Losses reasonably incurred by the
Buyer, in connection with each and all of the following:

                           (a)      Any claims against, or liabilities or
obligations of, the Seller or against the Assets not specifically assumed by the
Buyer pursuant this Agreement;

                           (b)      The failure of the Buyer to obtain the
protections afforded by compliance with the notification and other requirements

applicable to either the Seller or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

                           (c)      Any warranty claim or product liability
claim relating to (i) products manufactured or sold by the Seller prior to the

                           (e)      Any claims against, or liabilities or

                           ------------
harmless the Seller from any and all Losses reasonably incurred by the Seller in
connection with any claim against, or liabilities or obligations of, the Seller

representation, warranty or covenant contained herein with respect to such
Assumed Liabilities.

                  7.4      Claims for Indemnification. Whenever any claim shall
                           --------------------------
arise for indemnification hereunder the party seeking indemnification (the
"Indemnified Party"), shall promptly notify the party from whom indemnification
is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the claim and, when known, the facts
constituting the basis for such claim. In the event of any such claim for
indemnification hereunder resulting from or in connection with any claim or
legal proceedings by a third-party, the notice to the Indemnifying Party shall
specify, if known, the amount or an estimate of the amount of the liability
arising therefrom. The Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any
claim by a third party for which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, unless suit shall have been instituted against it and the
Indemnifying Party shall not have taken control of such suit after notification
thereof as provided in Subsection 7.4 of this Agreement.

                  7.5      Defense by Indemnifying Party. In connection with any
                           -----------------------------
claim giving rise to indemnity hereunder resulting from or arising out of any
claim or legal proceeding by a person who is not a party to this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Party at its sole cost and expense may, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party, assume the defense of any such claim or legal proceeding if
it acknowledges to the Indemnified Party in writing its obligations to indemnify
the Indemnified Party with respect to all elements of such claim. The
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the
defense of any such action, with its counsel and at its own expense. If the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any such claim or litigation
resulting therefrom within 30 days after the date such claim is made, (a) the
Indemnified Party may defend against such claim or litigation, in such manner as
it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such claim or
litigation, after giving notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party, on such
terms as the Indemnified Party may deem appropriate, and (b) the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of such
action, with its counsel and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party
thereafter seeks to question the manner in which the Indemnified Party defended
such third party claim or the amount or nature of any such settlement, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the burden to prove by a preponderance of the
evidence that the Indemnified Party did not defend or settle such third party
claim in a reasonably prudent manner. For purposes of this Section 7.5, if the
claim is one for which the Buyer may seek to receive indemnification payments
out of the Escrow, Mr. Eric Campbell shall be notified of such claim
simultaneously with notification to the Seller and shall be entitled to the same
rights as the Seller has pursuant to this Section 7.5

                  7.6      Payment of Indemnification Obligation. The Seller and
                           -------------------------------------
the Buyer hereby agree that any amount for which the Buyer is entitled to
indemnification under this Section 7 or Section 11of this Agreement shall first
be paid to the Buyer out of the Escrow.

                  7.7      Survival of Representations; Claims for
                           ---------------------------------------
Indemnification. All representations and warranties made by the parties herein
- ---------------
or in any instrument or document furnished in connection herewith shall survive
the Closing and any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of the
parties hereto. All such representations and warranties shall expire on the
third anniversary of the Closing Date, except for claims, if any, asserted in
writing prior to such third anniversary, which shall survive until finally
resolved and satisfied in full. All claims and actions for indemnity pursuant to
this Section 7 for breach of any representation or warranty shall be asserted or
maintained in writing by a party hereto on or prior to the expiration of such
three-year period.

                  7.8      Sole Remedy. The indemnification rights provided in
                           -----------
this Section

                                      -29-
<PAGE>

7 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties hereto and their
successors and assigns with respect to any and all claims for Losses incurred
arising out of any breach of a representation or warranty under this Agreement,
except for any rights the Buyer may have (a) against an Original Shareholder for
any fraudulent misrepresentation or a breach by such Original Shareholder of its
agreements contained in Sections 8.1, 8.2 or 8.3 or (b) for any fraudulent
misrepresentation or any material breach of any covenant contained in this
Agreement by the Seller.

         8.       Post-Closing Agreements.
                  -----------------------

         The Seller, and where applicable the Original Shareholders, agree that
from and after the Closing Date:

                  8.1      Proprietary Information.
                           -----------------------

                           (a)      The Seller and the Original Shareholders
shall hold in confidence, and Seller shall use its best efforts to have all of
its officers, directors and employees hold in confidence, all knowledge and
information of a secret or confidential nature with respect to the business of
the Seller and shall not disclose, publish or make use of the same without the
consent of the Buyer, except to the extent that such information shall have
become public knowledge other than by breach of this Agreement by the Seller.

                           (b)      The Seller and the Original Shareholders
agree that the remedy at law for any breach of this Subsection 8.1 would be
inadequate and that the Buyer shall be entitled to injunctive relief in addition
to any other remedy it may have upon breach of any provision of this Subsection
8.1.

                  8.2      No Solicitation or Hiring of Former Employees. Except
                           ---------------------------------------------
as provided by law, for a period of two years after the Closing Date, the Seller
and the Original Shareholders shall not solicit any person who was an employee
of the Seller on the Closing Date to terminate his employment with the Buyer or
to become an employee of the Seller or hire any person who was such an employee
on the Closing Date.




                  8.3      Non-Competition Agreement.
                           -------------------------

                           (a)      For a period of two years after the Closing
Date, neither the Seller, the Original Shareholders, nor any Affiliate thereof
shall (i) manufacture, market

                                      -30-
<PAGE>

or sell any product which has the same or substantially the same form, function
and primary application as any existing or proposed product manufactured by the
Seller on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii) engage in any business
competitive with the business of the Seller as conducted on the date hereof or
on the Closing Date, in the United States or any other country in which the
Seller conducted its business during the two years prior to the Closing Date.

                           (b)      The parties hereto agree that the duration
and geographic scope of the non-competition provision set forth in this
Subsection 8.3 are reasonable. In the event that any court determines that the
duration or the geographic scope, or both, are unreasonable and that such
provision is to that extent unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the
provision shall remain in full force and effect for the greatest time period and
in the greatest area that would not render it unenforceable. The parties intend
that this non-competition provision shall be deemed to be a series of separate
covenants, one for each and every county of each and every state of the United

involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements (including statements to the
effect that we "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "plan" and similar
expressions) that are not statements relating to historical matters should be

Item 1. Business.

The Company

   We provide software solutions that create an e-business infrastructure for
use by businesses and financial institutions to present invoices, make payments
and conduct electronic banking. Our products and services enable organizations
to transition from traditional paper-based billing and payment processes to
electronic processes to facilitate e-commerce. We also provide technology for
banks and companies to access banking applications over the Internet. Our
electronic bill presentment and payment software, NetTransact, provides a
secure, interactive system for complex business-to-business transactions that
allows companies to present billing information and accept payments over an
extranet. Our PayBase payments software provides a Web-interface to control,
manage and issue all payments, whether paper-based or electronic, across an
enterprise. BankQuest is our electronic banking product that provides Internet-
based access to banking applications such as cash management, trade finance and
securities processing. SmARt Cash is a software product that improves the
efficiency of accounts receivables transactions by automating the process of
matching payments and remittance information to open invoices.

   Our products enable customers to leverage the Internet to automate existing
operations while increasing security and fraud avoidance. They also complement
our customers' existing information systems, accounting applications and
banking functions. To integrate with our customers' existing operations, we
provide multiple options for delivery of complex invoices and detailed payment
or remittance information. We also offer consulting services and related
equipment and supplies to help customers plan, design and implement the
transition from paper to electronic processes.

   With our recent acquisition of UK-based Checkpoint Holdings, Ltd., we have
opened a new distribution channel, expanded our international reach and
increased our capacity to support our channel partners and global customers.
The acquisition of Checkpoint Holdings represents a growth opportunity for us
as we seek to provide our products and services to the global eCommerce
marketplace. We have also recently expanded our development capabilities
through the acquisition of Flashpoint, Inc., a web-based software development
organization based in Boston, MA.

 NetTransact Product

   Our NetTransact product provides a pathway for organizations to move from
paper-based to electronic invoicing and payments. NetTransact offers businesses
and financial institutions the following benefits:

  .  Open and interactive bill presentment technology. NetTransact enables
     businesses and banks to leverage electronic billing and maintain an
     open, interactive relationship with customers and corporate account
     holders. It permits speedy and efficient access to accounts receivable
     and accounts payable departments, and it disseminates complex billing
     information wherever required across an organization, regardless of
     whether the bill is one page or thousands of pages.

  .  Facilitation of timely resolution of billing disputes. NetTransact
     allows payers to review and, if necessary, make adjustments to a bill
     on-line. For example, if an invoice incorrectly states the number of
     products delivered, or if a number of items were damaged during
     shipment, the payer can generate

                                       1
<PAGE>

     an adjustment that is e-mailed to the biller for resolution and pay the
     undisputed amount, without having to wait for a new invoice to be
     transmitted.

  .  Cost effective bill presentment solution. NetTransact accelerates cash
     receipts and reduces days sales outstanding (DSO) for billers by
     identifying exceptions and providing an efficient means of dispute
     resolution. NetTransact also provides operational efficiencies to reduce
     staffing, mailing, processing and audit costs, as well as costs
     associated with making adjustments and resolving disputes arising in the
     billing process. Its cost savings and cash flow benefits to both
     corporate billers and payers offer value enhancements to all
     participants in the billing process.

  .  Improved invoice management for payers. NetTransact allows payers to
     identify and manage invoices and schedule payments with time sensitive
     priorities, enhancing their responsiveness and their vendor
     relationships and enabling them to better take advantage of payment term
     discounts. NetTransact also streamlines the payables process to provide
     payers with improved control over cash outflow.

  .  Internet based solution. NetTransact leverages the Internet as an
     effective means of e-commerce and can be integrated with our other
     Internet solutions to provide a complete bill presentment, payment and
     banking solution in an Internet environment.

  .  Savings to billers through reductions in float. By avoiding the delays
     associated with preparation of paper bills, their submission by mail and
     correspondence relating to disputed matters, NetTransact enables
     enterprises to reduce the expense associated with float on outstanding
     receivables.

  .  Seamless integration with accounting systems NetTransact fully
     integrates with existing accounting systems to facilitate data transfer
     into both the receivables and payables functions for the biller and
     payer respectively.

 PayBase Products

   Our PayBase product suite offers customers the following benefits:

  .  Internet/intranets remote access capability. Our PayBase product suite
     provides users with a secure, convenient means to remotely access and
     control payment information. PayBase enables enterprises to manage and
     control payments through the Internet and intranets.

  .  Flexible, dual payment process. Our PayBase product suite has been
     designed to provide customers with a single software solution that
     permits both paper and electronic payments. PayBase's dual payment
     capacity gives enterprises the flexibility to manage the transition to
     electronic payments at a pace compatible with the needs of their vendors
     and business partners as they evolve in response to market demands and
     government mandates.

  .  Enterprise-wide payment control. Our PayBase product suite offers
     enterprises a centralized payment control and management system while
     allowing users to make payments where needed within an organization.
     PayBase records all payments, transactions and events in a central
     database, which improves cash management, control of disbursement and
     receipt functions and audit capabilities. In addition, our PayBase
     payment control capabilities permit enterprises to readily outsource
     payment management functions to banks or other third-party suppliers.

  .  Cost-effective payment solution. Our PayBase product suite provides
     operational efficiencies that reduce staffing, mailing, processing and
     auditing costs as well as costs associated with float, risk of error,
     fraud and fraud related inquiries. PayBase is designed to be easy to use
     and implement, limiting the commitment of an enterprise's resources
     required to achieve operational efficiencies.

  .  Open and scaleable technology. Our PayBase product suite runs on one or
     more application servers using Microsoft Windows operating systems and
     leading database servers such as Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle and IBM
     DB2 Universal Server. PayBase's flexible design provides an enterprise
     with a scaleable solution to meet growing needs and to manage the
     migration from a department-wide to

                                       2
<PAGE>

     an enterprise-wide system that provides high levels of performance and
     supports high volumes of payment activity.

  .  Enhanced security and fraud protection. Our PayBase product suite
     reduces the risk of fraud through a secure, encrypted database and the
     control of all payment and operator activity. In addition, PayBase can
     automatically send a file of all checks issued instantaneously to the
     payer's bank, enabling banks to quickly isolate fraudulent or incorrect
     checks and to evaluate questionable payments. For its laser-printing
     process, LaserCheck uses blank paper that is non-negotiable until it is
     printed and can use specialized magnetic ink character recognition
     (MICR) printers for additional security.

 BankQuest Product

   Our BankQuest product offers customers the following benefits:

  .  Internet-based access to banking applications. Our BankQuest product
     enables banks to provide their corporate and institutional customers
     with a Web-based interface to access banking services such as trade
     finance, cash management and securities processing.

  .  Increased speed and accuracy in transactions. By providing an electronic
     interface into banking applications, BankQuest helps banks to improve
     the processing speed and accuracy of transactions by reducing potential
     delays and input errors associated with a manual paper-based process.

  .  Integration with existing back-office banking systems. Our BankQuest
     product also serves as an intermediary software solution that integrates
     with legacy banking applications systems. This enables banks to provide
     an additional service to their customers without having to incur the
     expense of rewriting the existing interface for back-office banking
     functions.

  .  Reduced costs associated with electronic banking. Our BankQuest product
     provides Internet access to banking functions that previously required
     dedicated resources to implement. By reducing the costs associated with
     installation and maintenance of these resources, banks can offer
     Internet-based banking services to additional customers.

Strategy

   Our objective is to be the leading provider of software solutions that
enable businesses and financial institutions to create an automated e-business
infrastructure to initiate, implement and manage movements of cash resources,
including bill presentment and payment and electronic banking software. Key
elements of our strategy include the following:

  .  Focus on the Internet as the medium for billing, payments, and
     electronic banking. Our PayBase product allows enterprises to use the
     Internet or a corporate intranet to make payments from a remote site and
     to send and receive remittance advices via e-mail. With NetTransact, we
     provide our customers with an integrated, secure bill presentment and
     payment solution that can support e-commerce over the Internet. With
     BankQuest, we enable financial institutions to provide their customers
     with Internet access to electronic banking functions such as cash
     management, trade finance and custody services.

  .  Develop new products and technologies. We intend to develop new products
     and technologies which leverage our existing offerings and customer
     base. To capitalize on the growth of the Internet and e-commerce, and
     changes in payment technologies and practices, we employ professionals
     who are skilled in the complex environments of e-commerce, financial
     EDI, banking and payment and billing systems. Furthermore, our technical
     staff is experienced in the latest database, networking and software
     development tools, technologies and methodologies. We intend to leverage
     this combination of business expertise and technical knowledge to
     enhance our existing offerings and deliver new products and
     technologies, including products incorporating XML, an emerging e-
     commerce interface standard.


                                       3
<PAGE>

  .  Expand and leverage strategic relationships. We intend to expand and
     leverage our relationships with business partners who play a key role in
     the sales, marketing and distribution of our products. We expect to
     expand sales through our existing strategic alliances with companies
     such as Citibank, UPS Capital, FleetBoston Financial, The Northern Trust
     Company and Princeton eCom, who have selected our software for key
     platforms and who are offering NetTransact to their customers. We will
     also pursue new channel partnerships and continue to leverage our
     relationships with leading technology providers. We also intend to
     expand our relationships with enterprise resource planning and
     accounting system vendors, such as Oracle, PeopleSoft and SAP, and with
     consulting firms that assist companies with the implementation of our
     products.

  .  Pursue strategic acquisitions. We believe that significant opportunities
     exist to acquire industry expertise and resources to support our product
     suite, to increase our product offerings and distribution and to provide
     access to international markets. This will assist us in achieving our
     goal of providing a comprehensive business-to-business e-commerce
     infrastructure to initiate, implement and manage movements of cash
     resources to the worldwide market. We therefore intend to continue to
     actively pursue acquisitions of such technologies, as well as
     opportunities to broaden our client base and/or expand our geographic
     presence.

  .  Leverage our acquisition of CheckPoint Holdings, Ltd. In acquiring
     CheckPoint Holdings, Ltd., we have opened a new distribution channel,
     expanded our international reach and increased our capacity to support
     our global customers and channel partners. We intend to leverage the
     acquisition by introducing our products internationally through
     Checkpoint and enhancing our existing products with CheckPoint's
     expertise.

  .  Further penetrate customer base. We intend to further penetrate our
     existing customer base, which we believe is only in the early stages of
     implementing electronic bill presentment and payment solutions.
     Additional sales opportunities to our existing customers include:

    .  cross-selling our electronic bill presentment software to increase
       overall sales of an integrated electronic invoicing and payment
       solution to our existing customers;

    .  selling our electronic banking product to financial institutions
       that are existing customers and can benefit from its application;

    .  expanding department level installations to encompass an
       enterprise's entire payment system;

    .  adding complementary payment capabilities through sales of
       additional software modules, such as electronic payment and receipt
       creation or check fraud avoidance;

    .  introducing software upgrades marketing new products; and

    .  generating additional revenues from our customer base by providing
       maintenance and support services and selling supplies.

  .  Expand customer base. We intend to expand our broad customer base by:

    .  supporting our existing co-marketing relationships to introduce our
       products to their customer base;

    .  adding additional co-marketing relationships with financial
       organizations and hosting partners to re-market our products;

    .  enhancing our direct sales force to market to large enterprises;

    .  targeting sales opportunities with financial institutions by
       leveraging our experience and industry recognition as the developer
       of FedEDI, the Federal Reserve System's financial Electronic Data
       Interchange or EDI software solution; and

    .  pursuing strategic acquisitions.

  .  Expand international capabilities. We intend to enhance our products
     with additional functionality to expand their use in international
     markets. We believe that this will enable us to better accommodate
     existing and future customer needs. We have begun initiatives to extend
     product

                                       4
<PAGE>

     capabilities to accommodate multiple language output, multiple currency
     requirements and international standards.

Products and Services

   Our software products enable enterprises to electronically present bills to
their customers, control, manage and issue all payments, whether paper-based or
electronic, and access electronic banking functions. We also offer
complementary add-on functionality software for our payment products that
customers can select according to their specific needs, as well as hardware to
complement our software product offerings. Our software products are further
enhanced by an experienced and integrated consulting service and support
system. These consultants help customers to plan, design, implement and manage
an organization's transition from paper-based to electronic invoicing and
payments to enhance operational productivity and customer satisfaction.

 NetTransact Product

   NetTransact supports corporate billing applications through features that
are designed to meet the specific needs of the business-to-business
environment. NetTransact is a secure interactive system that allows companies
to present billing information and accept payment for transactions. NetTransact
operates on an extranet-based Web site in which both billers and payers have an
electronic interface. The NetTransact system integrates with the billers' and
payers' existing receivables and payables management processes and provides
trading partners with opportunities to communicate online before funds are
transferred. Payers have the ability to review invoices online, modify them if
necessary, approve them for payment and schedule the date of funds transfer to
take advantage of payment discount terms. NetTransact is currently configured
to make payments using the Automated Clearing House (ACH) and represent
authorized debits to the payer's account.

   NetTransact provides benefits to both billers and payers, creating business
value for trading partners. Its benefits include:

  .  Benefits to Billers

    .  improved cash management by accelerating receipts to reduce total
       days sales outstanding;

    .  reduction in administrative costs in accounts receivable;

    .  improved billing accuracy;

    .  real-time access to credit risk management and income forecasting;

    .  streamlined operations with the ability to resolve billing
       differences online before funds are transferred; and

    .  ability to conduct electronic transactions with customers not
       configured for electronic data interchange (EDI).

  .  Benefits to Payers

    .  streamlined payables processing with improved cash management and
       more control over payment schedules to manage cash flow;

    .  increased opportunity to take advantage of biller discount terms;

    .  lower costs through a reduction in data-entry costs and automatic
       payment through accounts payable;

    .  improved communication with business partners through online
       resolution of billing differences both on an entire-bill or line-by-
       line basis; and

    .  Internet access to participate in electronic transactions without
       incurring additional costs for financial electronic data interchange
       (EDI) hardware or software resources.

   ESP (Electronically Sent Payments) Module. The ESP module allows users to
create electronic payments, facilitating the transition from paper checks to
electronic funds transfer (EFT). This module permits users to create electronic
payment files for their banks that meet the industry requirement of NACHA--The
Electronic Payments Association, and other financial EDI (FEDI) protocols. With
this module, users can process instructions received from a payment system,
such as payroll or accounts receivable. The PayBase ESP module can also create
electronic tax payments in the formats required by federal and state
governments. When the ESP module is installed with our LaserCheck printing
software module, PayBase can create both electronic payments and checks during
the same payment run. The ESP module also can create financial EDI payments
that will allow vendors to automatically post financial EDI remittance
information to their accounts receivable system. This feature eliminates the
need for vendors to manually enter information into accounting ledgers, saving
time and preventing mistakes.

   ERADS (Electronic Remittance Advice Delivery System) Module. The ERADS
module allows an enterprise to convert to electronic payments immediately and
to deliver the remittance detail by fax, e-mail, communications networks or the
Internet, depending on the technology available to its payees. This module can
be used for payments to individuals (e.g., travel reimbursements) and to
enterprises (e.g., vendor payments). Whenever payments are sent electronically
through the secure Automated Clearing House network, the ERADS module
automatically channels the remittance details to each payee by the appropriate
media and the payee receives an electronic payment directly deposited into its
bank account. Enterprises can realize cost efficiencies through reduced check
printing or processing and the lower cost of transmitting remittance
information electronically.

   PayBase Web Series (Internet/Intranet Access) Modules. The Web Series
Internet/intranet access modules extend the functionality of PayBase to the
Internet. PayBase Web Series allows enterprises to use the Internet or a
corporate intranet to request, approve and initiate payments from remote sites,
including locations that are not linked by a corporate network. Web Series can
also provide automatic e-mail delivery of remittance advice both internally and
to third parties such as vendors, customers and employees. Web Series
incorporates administration software that maintains central payment information
that can be accessed on the Internet or over an intranet by authorized users to
approve payments, review payment status and correct data as appropriate.

   PayView Module. The PayView module allows users to store and retrieve
electronic images of printed documents from financial applications such as
payroll, vendor payments, purchase order creation, claims payment and travel
and expense reimbursement. These images can be automatically e-mailed or faxed
to a recipient at the time of creation, reducing costs and delays associated
with the printing and handling of paper documents.

   LaserCheck Module. The LaserCheck module allows users to print checks,
including all variable data, such as magnetic ink character recognition lines,
logos and signatures, on blank paper using a laser printer. This module can be
deployed over the user's network or the Internet wherever it is needed, whether
in a

                                       6
<PAGE>

centralized printing facility, the issuing department or in a remote location.
With the module's CheckSort feature, users can sort checks to lower postage
rates and can produce copies in a specified order to simplify filing.
LaserCheck also provides password protection, as well as hardware and software
security features, and initiates printing of all checks, confirmation notices
and reports.

   Check Fraud Avoidance Module. The Check Fraud Avoidance module allows users
to automatically send a digital file of all checks issued to their bank. Most
commercial banks employ a "Positive Pay" system that determines when the check
is presented to the bank and whether a bank customer has in fact issued it. A
number of banks will only reimburse customers for check fraud losses if the
customer uses Positive Pay. This module protects the user from having altered
or unissued checks paid from their account and protects banks from fraudulent
checks received from other institutions. The Check Fraud Avoidance software
receives its data input from PayBase, but can also receive input from a non-
PayBase system that uses printed checks.

 BankQuest Product

   Our BankQuest product allows banks to provide their corporate and
institutional customers with electronic banking functions such as cash
management, trade finance and custody services over a browser-based platform.
This improves the processing speed and accuracy of banking functions by
reducing potential delays and input errors associated with a paper-based
process.

   BankQuest acts as an intermediary software solution that integrates with a
bank's legacy systems to enable electronic banking services to their customers
without the bank having to incur the expense of rewriting the existing code and
applications for their back-office functions. Additionally, banks reduce costs
and resources associated with implementing and supporting hardware/software
interfaces for their corporate and institutional customers. In reducing these
costs, banks also have the potential to extend their electronic banking
services to additional customers that were previously restricted by the costs
associated with installation and maintenance.

 SmARt Cash

   SmARt Cash is a software product that improves the efficiency of accounts
receivables transactions by automating the process of matching payments and
remittance information to open invoices. SmARt Cash interfaces with the lockbox
services of banks and receives a variety of source data which is processed to
match more accurately with the open invoices of the customer. In this manner,
the SmARt Cash software helps to automate the cash application process for
accounts receivables and reduces the clerical function of data entry and the
errors associated with a manual process. Our SmARt Cash product is available to
both banks and corporate customers.

 Professional Services

   Our team of service professionals draws on extensive experience in e-
commerce to provide consulting services, project implementation and training
services to our clients. Consulting service professionals are available to
review clients' current bill presentment and payment methods and processes,
report findings and recommend changes and solutions. Project implementation
professionals are available to coordinate system installation, including
billing and payment design, reporting format and delivery, bank data and
communication requirements, signature and authority set up and security, audit
and control procedures. We offer training services to all customer personnel
involved in the billing and payment cycle, including management, users and
information technology personnel involved in the transition from paper-based
methods to electronic methods.

 Equipment and Supplies

   We offer consumable products needed for payment disbursements and check
printing, including magnetic ink character recognition toner and blank-paper
check stock. We also provide printers and printer-related equipment, primarily
through drop-ship arrangements with our hardware vendors, to enhance our
software

                                       7
<PAGE>

product offerings. We have reseller agreements with the two leading secure
magnetic ink character recognition printer manufacturers in the country, Troy
Systems, which primarily uses Hewlett Packard printers, and Source Technology,
which primarily uses Lexmark printers.

Technology

   Our technology focus is on the industry standards for Internet and client
server platforms. NetTransact, our web-based invoice presentment and payment
system, converts an organization's existing billing file through proprietary
mapping tools into a file that is accessible over the Internet. This file is
transferred using file transfer protocol (FTP) to a secure hosting facility
where the payer can access the invoice using standard Web-browser technology.
Once the payer has reviewed the invoice and made any adjustments, either on the
total invoice or on a line-by-line basis, the payer approves the amount to be
paid and selects a payment date. On the payment date, NetTransact generates a
payment file that contains the bank routing information and account numbers for
both the payer and biller along with the remittance information. Upon receipt
of the file, the biller's bank initiates a secure debit through the Automated
Clearing House that transfers the funds from the payer's designated account to
the biller's designated account.

   The server platform for NetTransact is based on Sun Enterprise architecture.
For cross platform capabilities, it is written using the Internet-standard Java
programming language in conjunction with iPlanet Application Server. The data
for NetTransact is stored using database servers such as Sybase Adaptive Server
and Oracle 8i. Database connectivity within the system is accomplished through
the use of JDBC (java database connectivity). The security architecture for
NetTransact is based on sophisticated security protocols that support
firewalls, Secure Socket Layer, HTTPS (hyper text transfer protocol secure) and
digital certificates.

   PayBase/32/, our advanced 32-bit payment processing software, has been
designed using a client/server architecture. The server platform supports open
database connectivity (ODBC) compliant Unix and Windows NT databases. The
server platform is the warehouse for information relating to the customer's
payment solution, including security tables, application form parameters and
audit tables. The client workstation houses the PayBase executable programs.
This design enables PayBase to be highly scaleable for both distributed and
high volume centralized check printing, as well as electronic payment
origination. The client workstation interacts with the database to ascertain
authority, to retrieve information to create the form and to update the audit
tables with transaction information and payment result information. Print
output can be sent to any addressable network printer. The ESP and Check Fraud
Avoidance modules are bundled with communication software that allows scripting
of the data transmission. Transmission can be executed from any client
workstation.

   PayBase is designed to be network independent and can be implemented in
leading network architectures, including Novell, Windows NT and TCP/IP. The
product design creates predictable low volume network traffic in order to
minimize the implementation concerns for corporate information technology.
Installation of the product is highly automated using InstallShield.

   PayBase development methods conform to the latest Microsoft development
specifications, including extensive use of MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes)
and the DCOM/COM ((Distributed) Component Object Model) standards. Components
are designed as OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) Automation Servers for ease
of future development and enhancement as well as interoperability. Web enabled
components of PayBase are written as ActiveX controls. The primary development
tool is Visual C++.

   The PayBase suite also includes PayBase DesignerPlus, a sophisticated
proprietary data mapping and design tool. This tool is used to create
sophisticated payment applications using multiple form designs and multiple
payment methods, including all forms of electronic payments. It provides a
proprietary mapping tool to transform any type of host data file into the
format needed for efficient payment creation. The forms design function allows
easy creation of paper output formats from checks to W-2 forms and includes
design wizards to

                                       8
<PAGE>

further automate the process. The data mapping and design are securely linked
to the desired business payment process.

   Our electronic banking product, BankQuest, provides web-enabled information
reporting and transaction initiation, supporting a bank's cash management,
trade finance and custody business. The information reporting modules can
receive information from multiple back-office processing systems and
consolidate the information to be reported with up to eight levels of sub
reporting. The transaction initiation module allows the bank to present
customized instruction screens that replicate functions and features normally
reserved for a workstation environment.

   The BankQuest platform is made up of three main components, web servers,
database servers and hub servers. The web servers are independently scalable
and can be expanded for a high volume of simultaneous users. The database
servers are based on industry standards such as Microsoft and Oracle servers
and they are also independently scalable to service the required transaction
traffic and volume. The hub servers support data reformatting and interface
functions and are also scalable in order to be configured to meet the service
level requirements that are committed to clients in terms of data availability
and processing rates.

   For security, BankQuest provides Secure Socket Layer 3 and 128-bit
encryption. To meet our customer's security requirements, BankQuest also
provides supplemental security infrastructures such as digital signatures and
smart cards through our security partner, Ubizen. BankQuest also provides
application level security through an administrative tool that allocates access
levels for users along with types of information available to users.

Product Development and Engineering

   Our product development and engineering organization included 92 persons as
of June 30, 2000. There are three primary development groups: software
engineering, quality assurance and technical support. We spent $3.2 million in
fiscal year 1998, $4.0 million in fiscal year 1999 and $8.6 million in fiscal
year 2000 on product development and engineering costs.

   The software engineers have substantial experience in advanced software
development techniques as well as extensive knowledge of the complex processes
involved in business payment systems. Our engineers actively participate in the
Microsoft Developer Network programs and maintain extensive knowledge of
software development trends.

   Our quality assurance engineers have both extensive knowledge of our
products and expertise in software quality assurance techniques. Members of the
quality assurance group make extensive use of automated software testing tools
to facilitate comprehensive and timely testing of products. The quality
assurance group members participate in all beta releases, including all tests
of new products or enhancements, and provide initial training materials for
customer support and service.

   The technical support group provides all product documentation as well as
technical support for released products. Members of the technical group include
experienced technical writers, business analysts and network analysts. The
technical writers are versed in current document technology and work closely
with the software engineers to ensure documentation is clear, current and
complete. The technical support engineers are responsible for the analysis of
reported software problems and work closely with customers and customer support
staff. The group's broad knowledge of our products, operating systems,
communications, and printers allows them to rapidly respond to software
configuration needs.

Customers

   Our customer base includes over 2,500 companies in industries such as
financial services, health care, communications, education, media,
manufacturing and government.

Sales and Marketing

 Sales

   As of June 30, 2000, we employed 57 sales executives trained on Bottomline's
systems. Among these sales executives, 51 were divided among six geographical
markets and focused on sales to large and medium sized enterprises and six of
were focused exclusively on sales to large banks and financial institutions.
Eight systems engineers support our sales executives. We also have a dedicated
telephone-sales team that markets new applications, software upgrades and
additional services to our existing customers. In addition to our direct
selling efforts, we promote our products and services through strategic
relationships with our channel partners.

   In support of our NetTransact product, Bottomline has relationships with
leading organizations including Citibank, UPS Capital, FleetBoston Financial,
The Northern Trust Company and Princeton eCom. We expect these companies to
broaden our distribution channel and support our position in the market. We
also promote our products and services through relationships with enterprise
resource planning and accounting system vendors, such as Oracle, PeopleSoft and
SAP.

 Marketing

   We promote products and services through conferences, seminars, direct
marketing and trade publications. Our marketing partners sponsor joint mailings
and seminars and issue joint press releases with us, as well as advertising our
on their web sites. We also maintain membership in key industry organizations
such as Financial Services Technology Consortium, Microsoft Value Chain
Initiative, American Bankers Association and various operating committees of
NACHA--The Electronic Payments Association. In addition, we participate in
industry conferences such as the Association for Financial Professionals,
NACHA--The Electronic Payments Association, Payments, American Payroll Congress
and National User Conferences of Software Partners. We also promote brand
awareness through our public relations program and by advertising in respected
buying guides.

Competition

   We encounter competition from various sources for each of our products. For
NetTransact, most companies that are marketing electronic bill presentment
solutions have been primarily focused on business-to-consumer applications,
such as electronic presentment of utility bills, telephone bills and cable
service bills. If these companies expand their focus to include business-to-
business applications, we may encounter increased competition from companies in
this industry such as CheckFree, eDocs, Just-In-Time, Spectrum, Derivion and
Metavante.

   We also expect to encounter competition for NetTransact from companies
entering the business-to-business electronic bill presentment and payment
market along with some financial institutions, including large banks, that are
developing internal capabilities such as PNC Bank in conjunction with Perot
Systems.

   For PayBase, we currently compete primarily with companies that offer a
broad suite of electronic data interchange products, companies that provide a
broad spectrum of electronic payments solutions, such as CheckFree, and
companies that offer laser check printing software and services. To a lesser
extent, we compete with providers of enterprise resource planning solutions,
such as SAP and PeopleSoft, and providers of traditional payment products,
including check stock and check printing software and services, such as
Standard Register. In addition, some financial institutions operate as
outsourced providers of check printing and electronic payment services for
their customers. We also experience competition from our customers and
potential customers who develop, implement and maintain their own payment
solutions.

   For BankQuest, we primarily compete with companies, such as S1, that offer a
wide range of financial services including electronic banking applications. We
also encounter competition from companies that provide

                                       10
<PAGE>

traditional treasury workstation solutions. These companies include Brokat
Financial Services, Magnet Communications and Politzer and Haney. In addition,
we compete with a bank's internal technical development teams that develop and
implement their own proprietary solution.

   For all of our products, we believe we compete on a number of factors,
including:
  .  scope, quality and cost-effectiveness of our solutions;
  .  industry knowledge and expertise;
  .  interoperability of solutions with existing information technology and
     payments infrastructure;
  .  product performance and technical features;
  .  patented and proprietary technologies; and
  .  customer service and support.

   Although a number of our competitors may be better positioned to compete in
certain aspects of the payments industry, we believe that our market position
is enhanced by:
  .  our ability to provide a comprehensive e-business infrastructure for use
     by businesses and financial institutions to present invoices, make
     payments and conduct electronic banking;
  .  our relationships with our strategic partners;
  .  our large customer base; and
  .  the level of industry expertise of our development, sales and customer
     service and support professionals.

   Although we believe that we compete favorably in our industry, the markets
for payment management, electronic bill presentment and electronic banking
software are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological
change and a number of factors could adversely affect our ability to compete in
the future.

Backlog
   At the end of fiscal year 2000, backlog, including deferred revenue, was $31
million compared with backlog of $8.3 million at the end of fiscal year 1999.
We do not believe that backlog is a meaningful indicator of sales that can be
expected for any period, and there can be no assurance that the backlog at any
point in time will translate into revenue in any subsequent period.

Proprietary Rights
   We rely upon a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade-
secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and
products. We have filed patent applications relating to our products. However,
there can be no assurance that our patent applications, or any others that may
be filed in the future will issue or will be of sufficient scope and strength
to provide meaningful protection of our technology or any commercial advantage
to us, or that the issued patents will not be challenged, invalidated or
circumvented. In addition, we rely upon a combination of copyright and
trademark laws and non-disclosure and other intellectual property contractual
arrangements to protect our proprietary rights. Given the rapidly changing
nature of the industry's technology, the competence and creative ability of our
development, engineering, programming, marketing and service personnel may be
as or more important to its competitive position as the legal protections and
rights afforded by patents. We also enter into agreements with our employees
and clients that seek to limit and protect the distribution of proprietary
information. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect
our property rights, however, will be adequate to deter misappropriation of
proprietary information, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use and
take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual proprietary rights.

Government Regulation

   Although our operations have not been subject to any material industry-
specific governmental regulation, some of our existing and potential customers
are subject to extensive federal and state governmental

                                       11
<PAGE>

regulations. In addition, governmental regulation in the financial services
industry is evolving, particularly with respect to payment technology, and our
customers may become subject to increased regulation in the future.
Accordingly, our products and services must be designed to work within the
regulatory constraints under which our customers operate.

   Federal regulations require that all federal payments, other than payments
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, must be made electronically. These
regulations required that the conversion from checks to electronic payments be
made in two phases. During the first phase, recipients who became eligible to
receive federal payments on or after July 26, 1996 were required to receive
payments electronically unless they certified in writing that they did not have
an account with a financial institution or an authorized payment agent. The
second phase began on January 2, 1999. Beginning on that date, all federal
payments, except payments made under the Internal Revenue Code, are required to
be made electronically.

   The National Automated Clearing House Association now requires that, upon
the request of the receiver of an electronic payment, its bank must provide to
each receiver all payment-related information contained within the transmitted
remittance information. Banks must provide this information to their receivers
by the opening of business on the second banking day following the settlement
date of the entry.

   Current treasury regulations require that a business that paid more than
$50,000 in annual employment or other depository taxes in 1995, 1996 or 1997
now make such payments electronically. This requirement is effective for return
periods beginning before January 1, 2000. The date upon which a business first
becomes subject to the electronic payments requirement depends on the year in
which the business first paid more than $50,000 in depository taxes. Businesses
that made in excess of $200,000 of aggregate federal tax deposits in 1998 must
make such deposits electronically for all return periods beginning on or after
January 1, 2000. If a business first exceeds the $200,000 threshold in 1999 or
in any subsequent year, the electronic deposit obligation will be imposed for
the return period beginning after December 31 of the year ending after the year
the threshold was surpassed and will continue for all succeeding years. Non-
complying taxpayers may be subject to a 10% penalty if they fail to comply with
such requirements. In addition, state and local taxing authorities have been
implementing electronic solutions for collecting tax payments. The electronic
payment of certain taxes is required by law in states such as New York,
California, Connecticut and Arkansas.

   The closing price for our common stock on September 20, 2000 was $36 1/4.
For purposes of calculating the aggregate market value of the shares of our
common stock held by non-affiliates, as shown on the cover page of this report,
it has been assumed that all the outstanding shares were held by non-affiliates
except for the shares held by our directors and executive officers. However,
this should not be deemed to constitute an admission that all these persons
are, in fact, affiliates of ours, or that there are not other persons who may
be deemed to be affiliates of ours.

   We have never paid dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain our
earnings for use in our business and, therefore, do not anticipate paying any
cash dividends on our common stock for at least the next fiscal year.

Sales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds

   In June 2000, United Technologies Corporation purchased 307,882 shares of
common stock for an aggregate consideration of $9,951,000, net of expenses. In
connection with the equity investment, we issued warrants for the purchase of
307,882 shares of common stock to United Technologies Corporation at an
exercise price of $38.00. The warrants were fully vested and exercisable upon
date of issuance. The proceeds will be used for working capital purposes.

   In April 2000, we issued warrants to Citibank for the right to purchase
324,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $55.00. The warrants
were fully vested and exercisable upon date of issuance.

   These securities were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended ("the Act") pursuant to the exemption from the registration
requirements of the Act provided by Section 4(2) of the Act.

Use of Proceeds of Initial Public Offering

   On February 12, 1999 we made an initial public offering of 3,910,000 shares
of common stock registered under a Registration Statement on Form S-1
(Registration No. 333-67309), which was declared effective by the Securities
and Exchange Commission on February 11, 1999. Proceeds of our initial public
offering were used during the period between July 1, 1999 and June 30, 2000 in
the amount of $14.6 million to acquire software and related proprietary
intellectual property, assets and certain liabilities from The Northern Trust
Company, Integrated Cash Management Services, Inc., and OLC Software, Inc.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data.

   You should read the following financial data in conjunction with the
Financial Statements, including the related notes, and "Item 7--Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

   Prior to our initial public offering of common stock in February 1999, there
were 801,000 shares of redeemable common stock outstanding which were
redeemable at the option of the holders at a redemption price that increased
over time. The redemption rights terminated upon the occurrence of our initial
public offering. The earnings (loss) per share available to common stockholders
shown below for periods prior and up to the initial public offering have been
adjusted to reflect the increase in the redemption price for each such period.
The shares used in computing diluted earnings per share available to common
stockholders for periods prior and up to the initial public offering include
the redeemable common stock. For periods occurring after our initial public
offering, such shares are included in the basic earnings per share available to
common stockholders.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.

   The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
of operations should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and
the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Overview

   We provide a complete suite of applications to help our customers leverage
the Internet to reduce costs, streamline operations and improve existing
processes for payments. In 1989, we released our first product, LaserCheck for
DOS, to offer companies a cost-effective means to issue checks using
specialized laser printers and toners, eliminating the need for pre-printed,
negotiable check stock. In 1992, we entered into an arrangement with Xerox
Corporation to sell an advanced laser printer and newly developed magnetic ink
character recognition toners. Over the next few years we became one of the
largest re-sellers of Xerox Corporation magnetic ink character recognition
products. We then adapted our LaserCheck products to run on Windows 3.X and
Windows 95 operating platforms and developed new check fraud avoidance software
applications. Our PayBase payments software now provides a Web-interface to
control, manage, and issue all payments, whether paper-based or electronic,
across an enterprise.

   During fiscal year 2000, in order to expand our suite of applications, we
acquired NetTransact, an electronic bill presentment and payment software
product from The Northern Trust Company. NetTransact allows companies to
present billing information and accept payments over a secure, interactive
system for complex business-to-business transactions. We also acquired certain
assets and assumed certain liabilities from Integrated Cash Management, Inc.
(ICM), whose BankQuest software offers powerful cash management tools

                                       16
<PAGE>

and Internet access to advanced banking applications. BankQuest provides
Internet-based access to back-office banking applications such as cash
management, trade finance and securities processing. We also acquired all the
outstanding shares of OLC Software, Inc., whose SmARtCash product improves the
efficiency of accounts receivable transactions by automating the process of
matching payments and remittance information to open invoices.

   On August 28, 2000 we acquired two companies, U.K.-based Checkpoint
Holdings, Ltd. (Checkpoint) and Flashpoint, Inc. (Flashpoint) a professional
software development company. In acquiring Checkpoint, we have opened a new
distribution channel, expanded our international reach and increased our
capacity to support our global customers and channel partners. We intend to
leverage the acquisition by introducing our products internationally through
Checkpoint and enhancing our existing products with CheckPoint's expertise.

   Our goal is to be the leading provider of software solutions that enable
businesses and financial institutions to create an automated e-business
infrastructure to initiate, implement and manage the movements of cash
resources. Our customer base, now at over 2,500 companies, are in industries
such as financial services, health care, communications, education, media,
manufacturing and government. We provide our products and services to the
leading organizations in virtually every industry and currently include over
half of the Fortune 100 companies as our customers.

   Our revenues are primarily derived from the following three sources:

  .  Software License Fees. We derive software license revenues from our
     suite of software applications, which are generally based on the number
     of software applications and user licenses purchased, including PayBase,
     NetTransact and BankQuest. Fees from the sale of these software licenses
     are generally recognized upon delivery of the software to the customer.
     Certain software arrangements are recognized on a percentage of
     completion basis due to the fact that they require significant
     customization and modification.

  .  Service and Maintenance Fees. We derive service and maintenance revenues
     from (a) consulting, design, project management and training fees which
     are fixed on a project-to-project basis, (b) customer support and
     maintenance fees and (c) customer-specific customization of our
     BankQuest product. Revenues relating to custom consulting, design and
     service fees are recognized at the time services are rendered. Customer
     support and training fees are established as a percentage, typically 18%
     of the list price for the software license, and are prepaid annually.
     Support and maintenance agreements generally have a term of 12 months
     and are renewable annually. We recognize revenues related to customer
     support and maintenance fees ratably over the life of the agreement.
     Certain service contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion
     basis due to extensive customization and lengthy implementation.

  .  Equipment and Supplies Sales. We derive equipment and supplies revenues
     from the sales of printers, check paper and magnetic ink character
     recognition toners that are recognized at the time of delivery.

   We expect to continue making significant investments in product development
and engineering in order to enhance our current products, develop new products
and further advance our Internet and payment technologies. Future investments
in product development and engineering will generally be related to the hiring
of additional software engineering personnel.

   We record software development costs in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 86. We have not had any software development
costs that were capitalized during the last fiscal year and do not currently
have any software development costs that are being capitalized.

                                       17

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

   In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission published Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101"), "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements" which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and
disclosure of revenue in financial statements. Due to a variety of
implementation questions that have arisen, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) has deferred the implementation of SAB 101 until no later than
the fourth quarter for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1999. The SEC
is expected to issue further interpretive guidance in the fall of 2000. We will
adopt SAB 101 no later than the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending June
30, 2001. We are still assessing the impact of adopting SAB 101 and do not
expect to make a definitive assessment until the further guidance is issued.

   In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation" an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25 ("APB 25"), "Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees". Interpretation 44 clarifies guidance for
certain issues that arose in the application of APB 25. Areas of focus within
Interpretation 44 include repricings, modifications to extend the option term,
change of grantee status, modifications to accelerate vesting and options
exchanged in a purchase business combination. Interpretation 44 will be applied
prospectively to new awards, modifications to outstanding awards, and changes
in employee status on or after July 1, 2000. Effective July 1, 2000, should
these types of transactions occur, we will account for them under APB 25 as
clarified by Interpretation 44.

   In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No.
133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities", which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the
balance sheet effective July 1, 2000 at their fair value. We will adopt SFAS
133, as amended by SFAS 137 effective July 1, 2000. We do not expect the
adoption of SFAS 133 to have a material impact on our results of operations or
financial position.

Recent Developments

   On August 28, 2000 we acquired Checkpoint Holdings, Ltd. and Flashpoint,
Inc.

   Checkpoint, based in Reading, England, is an eCommerce and electronic
payments software provider. By acquiring Checkpoint's technology, expertise and
customer base, we opened a new distribution channel that will significantly
enhance our international growth opportunities. The transaction is valued at
approximately $82 million, including $15 million in cash consideration, $20
million in the form of a promissory note, 1,350,000 newly issued shares of
common stock, a warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of common stock at a price
of $50 per share and acquisition related costs. We will account for the
transaction as a purchase and will report Checkpoint's financial results under
our current revenue classifications.

   Flashpoint is a professional software development company based in Boston,
MA. Flashpoint has core expertise in Windows-based software development,
leading browser applications and programming languages including C++, Java and
XML. The purchase price is approximately $14.5 million, consisting of $4.5
million in cash, 242,200 newly issued shares of common stock, the assumption of
all outstanding stock options of Flashpoint and acquisition related costs. We
will exchange all outstanding stock options of Flashpoint for our options based
on the transaction conversion ratio. We will account for the transaction as a
purchase.

   The Company is evaluating and making preliminary assessments of the purchase
price allocation. The Company's early assessment is that a significant amount
of the purchase price will result in identifiable intangibles and goodwill and
will result in significant amounts of amortization in future years, including
fiscal year 2001. The Company's analysis is not yet complete but the Company
estimates the expected useful life to be in the three to five year range.

   In August 2000, we made a $900,000 equity investment in Princeton eCom, an
electronic bill presentment and payment services provider, and a $500,000
equity investment in Magnet Corporation, a business-to-business e-finance
infrastructure and services provider. Both of these investments will be
accounted for on the cost basis.

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2000 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1999

 Revenues

   Total revenues increased by $9.8 million to $49.1 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2000 from $39.3 million in the fiscal year ended June 30,
1999, an increase of 25%.

   Software Licenses. Software license fees increased by $3.6 million to $19.5
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 from $15.9 million in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, an increase of 23%. Software license fees
remained constant at approximately 40% of total revenues in the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2000 and June 30, 1999. The increase in software license fees
was due primarily to growing market acceptance of our NetTransact software
product, which was introduced in fiscal 2000.

   Service and Maintenance. Service and maintenance fees increased by $7.5
million to $19.9 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 from $12.4
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, an increase of 60%. Service
and maintenance fees represented 40% of total revenues in the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2000 compared to 32% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1999. The increase was due primarily to an

                                      19
<PAGE>

increase in the number of sales of software licenses, which resulted in
increased orders for services and sales of software maintenance and technical
support. In addition, there were several large contracts during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2000 accounted for on a percentage of completion basis due to
the required customization and modifications.

   Equipment and Supplies. Equipment and supplies sales decreased by $1.2
million to $9.8 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 from $11.0
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, a decrease of 11%. Equipment
and supplies sales represented 20% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2000 compared to 28% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June
30, 1999. The decrease in equipment and supplies sales was due primarily to our
de-emphasis of this lower margin source of revenues. We anticipate this source
of revenue to continue to decline as a percentage of total revenues due to
Northern Trust.

 Cost of Revenues

   Software Licenses. Software license costs consist of expenses incurred by us
to manufacture, package and distribute our software products and related
documentation, costs of licensing third-party software incorporated into our
products, and royalties to Northern Trust on revenues from our NetTransact
product. Software license costs increased by $300,000 to $561,000 in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2000 from $261,000 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999,
an increase of 115%. Software license costs increased to 3% of software license
fees in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 compared to 2% at June 30, 1999.
The increase in software license costs was due primarily to the NetTransact
royalties due to The Northern Trust Company.

   Service and Maintenance. Service and maintenance costs include salary
expense and other related costs for our customer service, maintenance and
telephone support staffs, as well as third-party contractor expenses. Service
and maintenance costs increased by $4.4 million to $9.7 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2000 from $5.3 million in the fiscal year ended June 30,
1999, an increase of 83%. Service and maintenance costs were 49% of service and
maintenance revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 compared to 43% of
service and maintenance revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999. The
increase in service and maintenance costs was due primarily to increased
staffing and personnel related costs to support the BankQuest product.

   Equipment and Supplies. Equipment and supplies costs decreased by $700,000
to $7.3 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 from $8.0 million in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, a decrease of 9%. Equipment and supplies costs
were 74% of equipment and supplies sales in the fiscal year ended June 30,
2000, which is consistent with costs totaling 73% of equipment and supplies
sales in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999.

 Operating Expenses

  Sales and Marketing:

   Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales
commissions, travel, public relations and marketing materials and trade shows.
Sales and marketing expenses increased by $2.8 million to $13.8 million in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 from $11.0 million in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1999, an increase of 26%. Sales and marketing expenses, excluding the
warrant discussed below, remained constant at 28% of total revenues in the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999. The dollar increase was due
primarily to increases in staffing and personnel related costs.

   Expense Associated with Warrants Issued. Expense associated with warrants
issued of $11.9 million represent non-cash charges related to the issuance of
warrants, that vested immediately, to two companies. The Company valued the
warrants issued using the Black-Scholes method assuming an expected life of
three years and a volatility of 91%. There was no comparable amount for the
year ended June 30, 1999 since no such warrants were issued in 1999. In the
future we may incur such costs in connection with transactions involving other
companies.

                                       20

 Product Development and Engineering:

   Product Development and Engineering. Product development and engineering
expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development.
Product development and engineering expenses increased by $4.6 million to $8.6
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 from $4.0 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1999, an increase of 116%. Product development and
engineering expenses before the in-process research and development charge
described below were 18% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30,
2000 compared to 10% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999.
The dollar increase was due primarily to increases in staffing and personnel
related costs to support our expanding suite of software products.

   In-process Research and Development. In-process research and development of
$3.9 million represents non-cash charges related to the NetTransact and ICM
acquisitions for in-process research and development during the year ended June
30, 2000. The in-process research and development projects were valued using an
Income Approach, which included the application of a discounted future earnings
methodology. Using this methodology, the value of the in-process technology is
comprised of the total present value of the future earnings stream attributable
to the technology throughout its anticipated life. No alternative future uses
were identified prior to reaching technological feasibility. In connection with
these acquisitions, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill amounts were
recorded and are being amortized over a period ranging from one to five years.
There was no comparable amount for the year ended June 30, 1999 since all the
acquisitions occurred in fiscal 2000.

   General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance
employees, legal and accounting services and certain facilities-related
expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $3.8 million to $8.6
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 from $4.8 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1999, an increase of 81%. General and administrative
expenses were 18% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000
compared to 12% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999. The
dollar increase was due primarily to staffing and personnel related costs,
additional facility and information system requirements resulting from
acquisitions and growth, and other expenses necessary to support our expanding
operations.

   Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets was
$2.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2000. There was no comparable amount
for the year ended June 30, 1999 since all the acquisitions occurred in fiscal
2000. As a result of our acquisitions, total identifiable tangible and
intangible assets and goodwill approximating $10.7 million or 15% of total
assets and 18.8% of stockholders equity was recorded.

   The carrying value of intangible assets is periodically reviewed by the
Company based on the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows of the
related asset. If an impairment is indicated, the Company will adjust the
carrying value of the intangible assets. No event has occurred that would
impair the value of long-lived assets recorded in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

   Interest Income (Expense), Net. Interest income (expense), net consists of
interest income and interest expense. Interest income (expense), net increased
by $1.1 million to $1.8 million of interest income in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2000 from $726,000 of interest income in the fiscal year ended June
30, 1999. The increase in interest income was due to higher available cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, as a result of our initial
public offering in February 1999, on hand for the entire fiscal year 2000.

   Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. Benefit for income taxes was $1.4
million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 which represents a change of
$4.1 million from a $2.7 million provision in the fiscal year ended June 30,
1999. The effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 was 9%
compared to 40% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999. The effective tax rate
of 9% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 differed from the federal
statutory rate due principally to the effect of expenses related to the
issuance of warrants during fiscal year 2000 that are not deductible for tax
purposes and acquisition related amounts which are not deductible for tax
purposes. The effective tax rate of 40% in the fiscal year June 30, 1999
differed from the

                                       21
<PAGE>

federal statutory rate due principally to the effect of state income taxes. As
of June 30, 2000 and 1999 we had net deferred tax assets of $2.8 million and
$412,000 respectively. The realizability of the net deferred tax assets at June
30, 2000 is more likely than not as such net deferred tax assets are
principally able to be carried back to taxes paid in prior years. The valuation
allowance increased by $2.3 million from June 30, 1999. This increase was
required to reduce the net deferred tax assets to the amount that is considered
more likely than not to be realized.

   Net Income (Loss). Net income decreased by $18.4 million to a $14.3 million
loss in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 from $4.1 million of income in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1999. The decrease in net income was due primarily
to the expense associated with warrants issued, acquisition related charges and
the increased operating costs associated with the Company's growth.

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1999 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1998

 Revenues

   Total revenues increased by $10.3 million to $39.3 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1999 from $29.0 million in the fiscal year ended June 30,
1998, an increase of 35%.

   Software Licenses. Software license fees increased by $6.0 million to $15.9
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999 from $9.9 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1998, an increase of 61%. Software license fees represented
40% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999 compared to 34% of
total revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. The increase in
software license fees was due primarily to growing market acceptance of our
PayBase product suite, and the delivery of software to The Federal Reserve
System, which resulted in recognition of one-time software license fees of
approximately $1.1 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999.

   Service and Maintenance. Service and maintenance fees increased by $2.7
million to $12.4 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999 from $9.7
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998, an increase of 28%. Service and
maintenance fees represented 32% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1999 compared to 33% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June
30, 1998. The dollar increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of
sales of software licenses, which resulted in increased orders for services and
sales of software maintenance and technical support.

   Equipment and Supplies. Equipment and supplies sales increased by $1.5
million to $11.0 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999 from $9.5
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998, an increase of 16%. Equipment
and supplies sales represented 28% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1999 compared to 33% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June
30, 1998. The increase in equipment and supplies sales was due primarily to an
increase in printer sales.

 Cost of Revenues

   Software Licenses. Software license costs consist of expenses incurred by us
to manufacture, package and distribute our software products and related
documentation and costs of licensing third-party software incorporated into our
products. Software license costs increased by $46,000 to $261,000 in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1999 from $215,000 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998,
an increase of 21%. Software license costs remained constant at 2% of software
license fees in each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 1999 and June 30, 1998.
The increase in software license costs was due primarily to third-party royalty
payments of approximately $100,000 made in connection with the software
delivered to The Federal Reserve System, which was offset by other small
reductions.

   Service and Maintenance. Service and maintenance costs include salary
expense and other related costs for our customer service, maintenance and
telephone support staffs, as well as third-party contractor expenses. Service
and maintenance costs increased by $1.1 million to $5.3 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1999 from $4.3 million in the fiscal year ended June 30,
1998, an increase of 25%. Service and maintenance costs

                                       22
<PAGE>

were 43% of service and maintenance revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30,
1999 compared to 44% of service and maintenance revenues in the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1998. The increase in service and maintenance costs was due
primarily to increased staffing and personnel related costs.

   Equipment and Supplies. Equipment and supplies costs increased by $1.5
million to $8.0 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999 from $6.5
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998, an increase of 23%. Equipment
and supplies costs were 73% of equipment and supplies sales in the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1999 compared to 69% of equipment and supplies sales in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. The increase in equipment and supplies costs
as a percentage of equipment and supplies sales was due primarily to
competitive pressure on the pricing of both hardware and supplies.

 Operating Expenses

   Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales
commissions, travel, public relations and marketing materials and trade shows.
Sales and marketing expenses increased by $3.3 million to $11.0 million in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1999 from $7.7 million in the fiscal year ended June
30, 1998, an increase of 43%. Sales and marketing expenses were 28% of total
revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999 compared to 26% of total
revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. The increase was due primarily
to increases in staffing and personnel related costs.

   Product Development and Engineering. Product development and engineering
expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development.
Product development and engineering expenses increased by $813,000 to $4.0
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999 from $3.2 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1998, an increase of 26%. Product development and
engineering expenses were 10% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June
30, 1999 compared to 11% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30,
1998. The dollar increase was due primarily to increases in staffing and
personnel related costs.

   General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance
employees, legal and accounting services and certain facilities-related
expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $383,000 to $4.8
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999 from $4.4 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1998, an increase of 9%. General and administrative
expenses were 12% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999
compared to 15% of total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. The
dollar increase was due primarily to staffing and personnel related costs and,
to a lesser extent, facility, information system and other expenses necessary
to support our expanding operations.

   Interest Income (Expense), Net. Interest income (expense), net consists of
interest income and interest expense. Interest income (expense), net increased
by $776,000 to $726,000 of interest income in the fiscal year ended June 30,
1999 from $50,000 of interest expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998.
The increase in interest income was due to higher available cash and cash
equivalent balances on hand as a result of our initial public offering in
February 1999 and lower average balances outstanding under our revolving credit
agreement.

   Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by $1.5
million to $2.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999 from $1.2
million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. The effective tax rate in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1999 was 40% compared to 42% in the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1998.

   Net Income. Net income increased by $2.5 to $4.1 million in the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1999 from $1.6 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

   We have financed our operations primarily from cash provided by operating
activities and the sale of our common stock. We had net working capital of
$41.0 million at June 30, 2000, including cash and cash equivalents and
marketable securities totaling $38.5 million.

                                       23
<PAGE>

   Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.4 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2000, $3.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999,
and $2.6 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. Net cash provided by
operating activities for each of the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2000 was
primarily the result of net income and increases in deferred revenues, accounts
payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by increases in accounts
receivable and prepaid expenses.

   Net cash used in investing activities was $29.4 million in the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2000, $1.4 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, and
$993,000 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. Cash was used in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2000 for the acquisition of businesses and assets and
marketable securities and to acquire property and equipment.

   On August 28, 2000 we acquired two companies Checkpoint Holdings, Ltd.
(Checkpoint) and Flashpoint, Inc. (Flashpoint) for an aggregate of
approximately $20 million in cash, $20 million in the form of a promissory
note, approximately $50 million in stock, and a warrant to purchase 100,000
shares of common stock at a price of $50 per share. We currently have no
significant capital spending or purchase commitments, but expect to continue to
engage in capital spending in the ordinary course of business.

   Net cash provided by financing activities was $13.6 million in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2000, and $36.1 million in the fiscal year ended June 30,
1999. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 million in the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1998. The net decrease was primarily the result of our initial
public offering of common stock in February 1999, as compared with issuance of
common stock to a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation and proceeds
from the exercise of stock options in the year ended June 30, 2000. Net cash
used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998
primarily represented repayment of indebtedness.

   We believe that the cash generated from operations and cash and cash
equivalents and marketable securities on hand will be sufficient to meet our
working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We also may receive
additional investments from, and make investments in, customers or other
companies.

                     FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

   Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should
carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before
purchasing our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are
not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties may
also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually
occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely
suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could fall, and you
may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock.

A significant percentage of our revenues to date have come from our payment
management offerings and our performance will depend on continued market
acceptance of these offerings

   A significant percentage of our revenues to date have come from the license
and maintenance of our payment management offerings and sales of related
products and services. Any reduction in demand for our PayBase product could
have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition. Our future performance will depend to a large degree upon the market
acceptance of PayBase as a payment management solution. Our prospects will also
depend upon enterprises seeking to enhance their payment functions to integrate
electronic payment capabilities. In addition, our future results will depend on
the continued market acceptance of desktop software for use in a departmental
setting, including our LaserCheck solution, as well as our ability to introduce
enhancements to meet the market's evolving needs for secure, payment management
solutions.

Our future financial results will depend upon market acceptance of our
NetTransact and BankQuest products

   If the NetTransact and BankQuest products that we acquired in recent
acquisitions do not achieve market acceptance, our future financial results
will be adversely affected. We acquired NetTransact bill presentment software
from The Northern Trust Company, a financial institution, in July 1999. General
availability of the NetTransact product was announced in February 2000. We
acquired the web-based BankQuest cash management software in our acquisition of
Integrated Cash Management Services, Inc. in October 1999. BankQuest was
commercially introduced in April 2000 and is now generally available. If either
of these products has any unanticipated performance problems or bugs, or does
not enjoy wide commercial success, our long-term business strategy would be
adversely affected.

Integration of new acquisitions.

   We have been actively pursuing acquisitions of other companies, including
our recent acquisitions of Checkpoint and Flashpoint, and plan to continue to
make such acquisitions in the future. If we are unable to integrate the
operations of the companies we acquire on a timely basis, we may lose the
benefit of these acquisitions. Such acquisitions may also create management
dislocation or result in unexpected costs. We have limited experience with
mergers and acquisitions and any such difficulties encountered as a result of
any mergers or acquisition could materially affect our business, operating
results and financial condition.

We must attract and retain highly skilled personnel with knowledge of
electronic payments and bill presentment and the banking industry

   We are dependent upon the ability to attract, hire, train and retain highly
skilled technical, sales and marketing, and support personnel, particularly
with expertise in electronic payment and bill presentment technology and
knowledge of the banking industry. Competition for qualified personnel is
intense. In addition, our corporate headquarters location in Portsmouth, New
Hampshire may limit our access to skilled personnel. Any failure to attract,
hire or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we plan to
expand our sales and marketing and customer support organizations. Based on our
experience, it takes an average of nine months for a salesperson to become

                                       25
<PAGE>

fully productive. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in increasing
the productivity of our sales personnel, and the failure to do so could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition.

Our fixed costs may lead to fluctuations in operating results if our revenues
are below expectations, and if our operating results are below external
expectations, the market price of our stock may fall.

   A significant percentage of our expenses, particularly personnel costs and
rent, are relatively fixed, and based in part on expectations of future
revenues. We may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate
for any significant fluctuations in revenues. Accordingly, shortfalls in
revenues may cause significant fluctuations in operating results in any
quarter. Quarterly operating results that are below the expectations of public
market analysts could adversely affect the market price for our common stock.
Factors that could cause these fluctuations include the following:

  .  The timing of orders and longer sales cycles, particularly due to any
     increase in average selling prices of our software solutions;

  .  the timing and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements
     by either us or our competitors;

  .  the timing of product implementations, which are highly dependent on
     customers' resources and discretion;

  .  the incurrence of costs relating to the integration of software products
     and operations in connection with acquisitions of technologies or
     businesses;

  .  delivery interruptions relating to equipment and supplies purchased from
     third-party vendors, which could delay system sales; and

  .  economic conditions which may affect our customers' and potential
     customers' budgets for technological expenditures.

   Because of these factors, we believe that period to period comparisons of
our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful.

The market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to be
subject to, extreme price and volume fluctuations

   Stock markets in general, and The Nasdaq Stock Market in particular, have
experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Broad market fluctuations of
this type may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

   The market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to be
subject to extreme fluctuations due to a variety of factors, including:

  .  public announcements concerning us, our competitors or our industry;

  .  fluctuations in operating results;

  .  introductions of new products or services by us or our competitors;

  .  adverse developments in patent or other proprietary rights;

  .  changes in analysts' earnings estimates;

  .  announcements of technological innovations by our competitors; and

  .  general and industry-specific business, economic and market conditions

We may experience accounting charges in connection with the issuance of
warrants

   During the quarter ended June 30, 2000, we incurred non-cash charges in
connection with the issuance of warrants to Citibank and a subsidiary of United
Technologies Corporation. In the future, we may experience similar accounting
charges to the extent we issue warrants to channel partners or others.

Our success depends on our ability to develop new and enhanced software,
services and related products

   The bill presentment, payment and cash management software markets in which
we compete are subject to rapid technological change and our success is
dependent on our ability to develop new and enhanced software, services and
related products that meet our evolving market needs. Trends which could have a
critical impact on us include:

  .  rapidly changing technology that could require us to make our products
     compatible with new database or network systems;

  .  evolving industry standards and mandates, such as those mandated by the
     National Automated Clearing House Association and by the Debt Collection
     Improvement Act of 1996; and

  .  developments and changes relating to the Internet that we must address
     as we introduce new products.

   If we are unable to develop and introduce new products, or enhancements to
existing products, in a timely and successful manner, our business, operating
results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Our success depends on the wide-spread adoption of the internet and growth of
electronic business

   Our future success will in large part depend upon the willingness of
businesses and financial institutions to adopt the Internet as a medium of e-
commerce. These entities will probably accept this new medium only if the
Internet provides substantially greater efficiency and enhances their
competitiveness. There are critical issues involved in the commercial use of
the Internet which are not yet fully resolved, including concerns regarding the
Internet's:

  .  security;

  .  reliability;

  .  ease of access; and

  .  quality of services.

   To the extent that any of these issues inhibit or limit the adoption of the
Internet as a medium of e-commerce, our business prospects could be adversely
affected. If electronic business does not continue to grow or grows more slowly
than expected, demand for our products and services may be reduced.

If the internet infrastructure is not adequately maintained, the demand for our
products and services may decrease

   Our future success will depend, in part, on the maintenance of the Internet
infrastructure. To the extent that the Internet continues to experience
increased numbers of users, frequency of use or increased bandwidth
requirements of users, the Internet infrastructure may not continue to support
the demands placed on it and, as a result, the performance or reliability of
the Internet may be adversely affected. In addition, the Internet could lose
its viability as a form of media due to delays in the development or adoption
of new standards and protocols that can handle increased levels of activity.
The infrastructure and complementary products and services necessary to
maintain the Internet as a viable commercial medium may not be developed or
maintained. Any failure in performance or reliability of the Internet could
adversely affect the demand for our products and services and, consequently,
hurt our operating results.

Increased government regulation and legal uncertainties may impair the growth
of the internet and decrease demand for our products and services

   The laws governing the Internet remain largely unsettled, even in areas
where there has been some legislative action. It may take years to determine
whether and how existing laws, including those governing intellectual property,
privacy, libel and taxation, apply to the Internet generally and to the e-
commerce in

                                       27
<PAGE>

particular. Legislation could dampen the growth in the use of the Internet
generally and decrease the acceptance of the Internet as a communications and
commercial medium, which may decrease demand for our products and services and
thus have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

Our business can be adversely affected by problems with third-party hardware
that we resell

   Any problems with third-party hardware that we resell could harm our
customer relationships, industry credibility and financial condition. In a
prior fiscal year, we experienced a significant problem with a third-party
printer that we were then reselling which had a material adverse effect on our
operating results. Any repetition of these or similar problems with third party
hardware could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition.

Increased competition may result in price reductions and decreased demand for
our products and services

   The market for bill presentment, payment and cash management software is
intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. Growing
competition may result in price reductions of our products and services,
reduced revenues and gross margins and loss of market share, any one of which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and
financial condition. Some competitors in our market have longer operating
histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other
resources, greater brand recognition and a larger installed customer base than
we do. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic
acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships to expand their product
offerings and to offer more comprehensive solutions. We also expect to face
additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the
market for payment management solutions.

Rapid growth could strain our personnel, systems and controls

   In the past, rapid growth has strained our managerial and other resources.
Our ability to manage any future growth will depend in part on our ability to
continue to enhance our operating, financial and management information
systems. We cannot assure you that our personnel, systems and controls will be
adequate to support any future growth. If we are not able to manage growth
effectively, should it occur, the quality of our services, our ability to
retain key personnel and our business, operating results and financial
condition could be materially adversely affected.

We depend on a few key employees who are skilled in e-commerce, payment
methodology and internet and other technologies

   Our success depends upon the efforts and ability of our executive officers
and key technical employees who are skilled in e-commerce, payment methodology
and regulation, and Internet, database and network technologies. We currently
do not maintain "key man" life insurance policies on any of our employees.
While some of our executive officers have employment agreements with us, the
loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees
could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and
financial condition.

Undetected bugs in our software could adversely affect the performance of our
software and demand for our products

   Our software products could contain errors or "bugs" that we have not been
able to detect which could adversely affect their performance and reduce demand
for our products. Any defects or errors in new products, such as NetTransact or
BankQuest, or enhancements could harm our customer relationships and result in
negative publicity regarding us and our products, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.


                                       28
<PAGE>

Our business could be subject to product liability claims

   Because our software and hardware products are designed to provide critical
payment management and invoicing functions, we may be subject to significant
product liability claims. Our insurance may not be sufficient to cover us
against these claims or may not be available at all. A product liability claim
brought against us, even if not successful, could require us to spend
significant time and money in litigation. As a result, any such claim, whether
successful or not, could seriously damage our reputation and harm our business,
operating results and financial condition.

Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our
proprietary technology

   We rely upon a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws and non-
disclosure and other intellectual property contractual arrangements to protect
our proprietary rights. However, we cannot assure you that our patents, pending
applications that may be issued in the future, or other intellectual property
will be of sufficient scope and strength to provide meaningful protection of
our technology or any commercial advantage to us, or that the patents will not
be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We enter into agreements with our
employees and clients that seek to limit and protect the distribution of
proprietary information. We cannot assure you that the steps we have taken to
protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter
misappropriation of proprietary information, and we may not be able to detect
unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual
property rights.

We could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights,
which could seriously harm our business

   In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States
involving patents and other intellectual property rights. We may be a party to
litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or as a result of
an alleged infringement of the intellectual property of others. These claims
could require us to spend significant sums in litigation, pay damages, delay
product installments, develop non-infringing intellectual property or acquire
licenses to intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement
claim. These claims could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operating results and financial condition.

We may incur significant costs from class action litigation due to the expected
volatility of our common stock

   In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price
of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation. If
we were the object of securities class action litigation, we could incur
substantial costs and experience a diversion of our management's attention and
resources and such securities class action litigation could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

   Our exposure to financial risk, including changes in interest rates, relates
primarily to cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. These
investments bear interest at a variable interest rate, which is subject to
market changes. We have not entered into any interest rate swap agreements, or
other instruments to minimize our exposure to interest rate increases. We have
not had any derivative instruments in the past and do no presently plan to in
the future.

   For purposes of specific risk analysis we use sensitivity analysis to
determine the impacts that market risk exposure may have on the fair value of
our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. To perform sensitivity
analysis, we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of
hypothetical changes in interest rates on market sensitive instruments. We
compare the market values for interest risk based on the present value of
future cash flows as impacted by the changes in the rates. We selected discount
rates for the present value computations based on market interest rates in
effect at June 30, 2000. We compared the market values resulting from these
computations with the market values of these financial instruments at June 30,
2000. The differences in the comparison are the hypothetical gains or losses
associated with each type of risk.

                                       29

   Our investment portfolio consists of demand deposit accounts, a money market
mutual fund and investment accounts. Due to the short-term average maturity of
the investment portfolio, a sudden sharp change in interest rates would not
have a material adverse effect on the value of the portfolio. Based on our
investment portfolio and interest rates, a 100 basis point increase or decrease
in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately
$400,000 and $385,000 for the years ended 1999 and 2000, respectively, in our
results from operations and cash flows.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors and Stockholders
Bottomline Technologies (de), Inc.

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bottomline
Technologies (de), Inc. as of June 30, 1999 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive
loss, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,
2000. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule
listed in the index at Item 14 (a). These financial statements and schedule are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Bottomline
Technologies (de), Inc. at June 30, 1999 and 2000, and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended June 30, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related consolidated
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                    Year Ended June 30, 1998, 1999 and 2000

1. Organization and Nature of Business

   Bottomline Technologies (de), Inc. was originally incorporated as a New
Hampshire corporation in 1989 and was reincorporated as a Delaware corporation
in August 1997. The Company is a software company that creates an automated e-
business infrastructure for use by businesses and financial institutions to
make payments and present bills. The Company's products and services are sold
to customers operating in many different industries throughout the world.

2. Significant Accounting Policies

 Principles of Consolidation

   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

   The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application
of certain significant accounting policies as described in this note and
elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.

 Cash and Cash Equivalents

   Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposit accounts, a money market
mutual fund and an overnight investment account at a financial institution. The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of
ninety days or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of these
instruments approximates their fair value.

 Marketable Securities

   The Company accounts for marketable securities in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities" (SFAS 115). SFAS 115 establishes the accounting
and reporting requirements for all debt securities and for investments in
equity securities that have readily determinable fair values. All marketable
securities must be classified as one of the following: held-to-maturity,
available-for-sale, or trading. The Company classifies its marketable
securities as available-for-sale and, as such, carries the investments at fair
value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity.

 Concentration of Credit Risk

   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities, and accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents subject us to
concentrations of credit risk as the Company had approximately $27,300,000
invested with a single financial institution at June 30, 2000. The Company
invests its excess cash and cash equivalents in high quality marketable
securities. Concentration of credit risk with respect to marketable securities
is limited as marketable securities are primarily investment-grade corporate
bonds with high-credit, quality financial institutions.

   Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited
due to the large number of companies and diverse industries comprising the
Company's customer base. At June 30, 2000, a subsidiary of United Technologies
Corporation, a related party, accounted for 14.4% of total accounts receivable.
On-going credit evaluations of customer' financial condition are performed and
collateral is generally not required. The Company maintains reserves for
potential credit losses and such losses, in the aggregate, have not exceeded
management's expectations.

                       BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES (de), INC.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


 Financial Instruments

   The fair value of the Company's financial instruments, which include cash
and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and accounts
payable are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated
future cash flows and assumed discount rates reflecting varying degrees of
perceived risk. The carrying value of these financial instruments approximated
their fair value at June 30, 1999 and 2000, respectively, due to the short-term
nature of these instruments.

 Inventory

   Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or
market.

 Property and Equipment

   Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization
and depreciation. Property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (three to five years).
Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser
of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.

 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

   Goodwill and other intangible assets represent core technology, contract
backlog, assembled workforce and goodwill in connection with acquisitions made
during the fiscal year. In connection with the acquisitions accounted for as
business combinations and the acquisition of assets, the Company recorded
intangible assets based on the excess of the purchase price over the
identifiable tangible assets acquired on the date of purchase. Intangible
assets are reported at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and are being
amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to five years.
Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, was
$8,416,000 at June 30, 2000. Amortization expense was $2,311,000 for the year
ended June 30, 2000.

   The carrying value of intangible assets is periodically reviewed by the
Company based on the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows of the
related asset. If an impairment is indicated, the Company will adjust the
carrying value of the intangible assets. No event has occurred that would
impair the value of long-lived assets recorded in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

 Advertising Costs

   The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were
$129,000, $136,000 and $358,000 for the years ended June 30, 1998, 1999 and
2000, respectively.

 Use of Estimates

   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Estimates include, but are not limited to,
the allowances for doubtful accounts and returns and accrued liabilities.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 Income Taxes

   Deferred income taxes are provided for differences in bases of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Temporary
differences relate primarily to acquisition-related intangibles, depreciation,

                                       44
<PAGE>

                       BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES (de), INC.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

various accruals, and allowances for doubtful accounts, returns and inventory.
The principal non-deductible expenses relate to the issuance of a warrant
during fiscal year 2000 and certain non-deductible acquisition-related
intangibles.

 Stock-Based Compensation

   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-
Based Compensation" (SFAS 123) encourages, but does not require, companies to
record compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans at fair
value. The Company has elected to continue to account for stock based
compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and
related Interpretations.

   Prior to the Company's initial public offering on February 12, 1999, the
Board of Directors determined the fair value of the Company's common stock in
its good faith judgement at each option grant date for grants under the equity
plans. In determining the fair value, the Board of Directors considered a
number of factors including the financial and operating performance, recent
transactions in the Company's common stock, if any, the values of similarly
situated companies and the lack of marketability of the Company's common stock.

 Capitalized and Acquired Software Costs

   Capitalization of software development costs under SFAS No. 86 begins upon
the establishment of technological feasibility. Technological feasibility is
established upon the completion of a working model. The establishment of
technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of recoverability of
capitalized software development costs require considerable judgment by
management with respect to certain external factors, including, but not limited
to, technological feasibility, anticipated future gross revenues, estimated
economic life, and changes in software and hardware technologies. Capitalized
and acquired software costs charged to operations were $253,000 for the year
ending June 30, 1998. For the years ended June 30, 1999 and 2000, there were no
costs capitalized since none met the definition of technological feasibility.

 Revenue Recognition

   In October 1997, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the
American Institute (AcSEC) of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of
Position (SOP) 97-2 "Software Revenue Recognition", which was adopted effective
July 1, 1998. SOP 98-4, "Deferral of the Effective Date of a Provision of SOP
97-2, Software Revenue Recognition" deferred the effective date of certain
aspects of SOP 97-2. Effective December 15, 1998, SOP 98-9 was issued which
amended SOP 98-4 and extended the deferral of the application of certain
passages of SOP 97-2 to transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning
after March 15, 1999. These statements superseded SOP 91-1, "Software Revenue
Recognition," and provide guidance on applying generally accepted accounting
principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions entered into in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. The adoption of SOP 97-2, as
amended by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9, did not have a material impact on the
Company's revenues and results of operations.

   Revenue recognition from software license fees is recognized when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the
fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. The Company's
software arrangements may contain multiple elements, such as software products,
services, hardware and post-contract customer support (PCS). Revenue earned on
software arrangements involving multiple elements which qualify for separate
element treatment is allocated to each element based on the relative fair
values of those elements based on vendor specific objective evidence. For the
year ended June 30, 2000, vendor specific objective evidence is limited to the
price charged when the element is sold separately or,

                                       45
<PAGE>

                       BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES (de), INC.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

for an element not yet being sold separately, the price established by
management having the relevant authority. Accordingly, revenue for software
licenses is recognized when the product is shipped. Revenue for services is
recognized as the services are provided to the customer. Revenue for PCS under
software maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the
agreement, generally one year. Revenue for hardware is recognized when the
product is shipped.

   Certain arrangements requiring significant customization and modifications
and extended implementation periods are accounted for using percentage of
completion contract accounting as defined by Statement of Position No. 81-1
("SOP 81-1"), "Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
Production-Type Contracts". Under SOP 81-1, revenue is recognized based on the
costs incurred during the reporting period as a percentage of the estimated
total contract costs.

   For the year ended June 30, 1998, revenue was recognized in accordance with
SOP 91-1 and, accordingly, revenue for software was recognized when the product
was shipped and there were no significant remaining company obligations.

 Customer Returns

   Customer returns are estimated and accrued for when known based on return
authorizations and past history.

 Earnings per Share

   The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 "Earnings Per Share" (SFAS 128). SFAS
128 requires calculation and presentation of basic and diluted earnings per
share. Basic earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding and excludes any dilutive effects of
warrants, stock options or other type securities. Diluted earnings per share is
calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
and the dilutive effect of stock options, warrants and related securities
calculated using the treasury stock method. Dilutive securities are excluded
from the diluted earnings per share calculation if their effect is
antidilutive.

 401(k) Plan

   The Company has a 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (the Plan), whereby eligible
employees may contribute up to 15% of their compensation, subject to
limitations established by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company may
contribute a discretionary matching contribution annually equal to 50% (30% in
1999 and 25% in 1998) of each such participant's deferred compensation up to 5%
of their annual compensation. The Company charged $98,000, $129,000 and
$294,000 to expense in the years ended 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively, under
the Plan.

 Comprehensive Income (Loss)

   The Company computes comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 130 (SFAS 130), "Reporting
Comprehensive Income". SFAS 130 establishes standards for the reporting and
display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements.
Comprehensive income, as defined, includes all changes in equity during a
period from non-owner sources, such as foreign currency translation adjustments
and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. Comprehensive
income was equal to net income for the years ended June 30, 1998 and 1999 since
there were no elements of comprehensive income. Comprehensive loss for the year
ended June 30, 2000 was

                                       46
<PAGE>

                       BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES (de), INC.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

$14,273,000. The difference between net loss and comprehensive loss for the
year ended June 30, 2000 was $8,000 of net unrealized losses on the Company's
investments.

 Segment Reporting

   Effective July 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No.131, "Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" (SFAS 131). SFAS 131
superseded FASB Statement No. 14, "Financial Reporting for Segments of a
Business Enterprise." SFAS 131 established standards for the way that public
business enterprises report information about operating segments in financial
reports. SFAS 131 also established standards for related disclosures about
products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The adoption of
SFAS 131 did not affect results of operations, financial position, or the
footnote disclosure as the Company operates in a single industry segment.

 Accounting Pronouncements

   In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission published Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101"), "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements" which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and
disclosure of revenue in financial statements. Due to a variety of
implementation questions that have arisen, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) has deferred the implementation of SAB 101 until no later than
the fourth quarter for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1999. The SEC
is expected to issue further interpretive guidance in the fall of 2000. We will
adopt SAB 101 no later than the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending June
30, 2001. We are still assessing the impact of adopting SAB 101 and do not
expect to make a definitive assessment until the further guidance is issued.

   In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation" an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25 ("APB 25"), "Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees". Interpretation 44 clarifies guidance for
certain issues that arose in the application of APB 25. Areas of focus within
Interpretation 44 include repricings, modifications to extend the option term,
change of grantee status, modifications to accelerate vesting and options
exchanged in a purchase business combination. Interpretation 44 will be applied
prospectively to new awards, modifications to outstanding awards, and changes
in employee status on or after July 1, 2000. Effective July 1, 2000, should
these types of transactions occur, we will account for them under APB 25 as
clarified by Interpretation 44.

   In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No.
133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities", which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the
balance sheet effective July 1, 2000 at their fair value. We will adopt SFAS
133, as amended by SFAS 137 effective July 1, 2000. We do not expect the
adoption of SFAS 133 to have a material impact on our results of operations or
financial position.

3. Product and Business Acquisitions

 NetTransact

   In July 1999, the Company acquired certain software and related proprietary
intellectual property, NetTransact, from The Northern Trust Company for
$3,800,000 in cash and acquisition costs. NetTransact allows for the electronic
presentment and payment of invoices and related dispute resolution in a
business-to-business environment. In connection with this product acquisition,
the Company recorded a $1,300,000 charge for acquired in-process research and
development and a $2,500,000 intangible asset that is being amortized on a
straight line basis over a five-year period. Accumulated amortization on
intangible assets was $503,000 at June 30, 2000. In

                                       47
<PAGE>

                       BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES (de), INC.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

connection with the acquisition, the Company is obligated to pay The Northern
Trust Company a 10% royalty on all NetTransact revenue related to the software
and certain other property acquired from The Northern Trust Company excluding
the initial $3,500,000 in revenues.

 Integrated Cash Management Services, Inc.

   In October 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and
assumed certain liabilities of Integrated Cash Management Services, Inc.
("ICM") for an aggregate of $9,300,000 in cash and acquisition costs.

   In connection with this asset acquisition, the Company recorded a $2,600,000
charge for acquired in-process research and development. The Company recorded
$6,700,000 of intangible assets consisting of core technology, contract
backlog, assembled workforce and goodwill. The intangible assets are reported
at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and are being amortized on a straight
line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to five years.
Accumulated amortization on intangible assets was $1,637,000 at June 30, 2000.

   The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase with results of operations
included with those of the Company for periods subsequent to the date of
acquisition.

 OLC Software, Inc.

   In February 2000, the Company acquired all outstanding shares of stock of
OLC Software, Inc. ("OLC") for an aggregate of $1,500,000 in cash and
acquisition costs. OLC was an early stage development company with limited
operations prior to the acquisition. In connection with this acquisition, the
Company recorded an intangible asset that is being amortized over its useful
life of three years. Accumulated amortization on intangible assets was $171,000
at June 30, 2000.

   The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase with results of operations
included with those of the Company for periods subsequent to the date of
acquisition.

 In-Process Research and Development

   In connection with the acquisitions of the NetTransact product and the ICM
net assets, the Company recorded in-process research and development charges of
$3,900,000 representing purchased in-process research and development that has
not yet reached technological feasibility. The Company's management made
certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable
assets resulting from, or to be used in, research and development activities as
of the respective acquisition dates.

   In the NetTransact product and ICM net asset acquisitions, the in-process
research and development projects were valued using an Income Approach, which
included the application of a discounted future earnings methodology. Using
this methodology, the value of the in-process technology is comprised of the
total present value of the future earnings stream attributable to the
technology throughout its anticipated life. As a basis for the valuation
process, the Company made estimates of the revenue stream to be generated in
each future period and the corresponding operating expenses and other charges
to apply to this revenue stream. In order to determine the value of the
earnings stream that was specifically attributable to the in-process
technology, the earnings attributable to the projects were calculated by
deducting the earnings streams attributable to all other assets, including
working capital and tangible assets. Based upon these assumptions, the future
after-tax income streams relating to the in-process technologies were
discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate that reflected
the uncertainty involved in successfully completing and commercializing the in-
process technologies.

   The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the
combined results of operations of the Company and ICM as if the acquisition had
occurred as of the beginning of fiscal 1999 and 2000, after giving effect to
certain adjustments, including amortization of goodwill and other intangible
assets. The pro forma financial information does not necessarily reflect the
results of operations that would have occurred had the Company and ICM been a
single entity during such period. Since NetTransact was a product acquistion
and OLC had very limited operations prior to the acquisition, no amounts are

7. Borrowing Arrangements

   The Company had a revolving credit agreement (the revolving agreement) with
a bank which provided for available borrowings of up to $5,000,000. The
revolving agreement expired on December 30, 1999 and the Company chose not to
renew it. There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving agreement at
June 30, 1999.

8. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

   The Company leases its principal office facility under a noncancellable
operating lease expiring in 2002. In addition to the base term, the Company has
two five-year options to extend the term of the lease. Rent payments are fixed
for the initial two years of the lease and may be increased after that during
the initial term of the lease by the Consumer Price Index. In addition, the
Company is obligated to pay certain incremental operating costs over the base
amount.

   The Company also leases office space in other cities. All such leases expire
by fiscal year 2010.

9. Capital Transactions

 Preferred Stock

   On November 12, 1998, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a class of
preferred stock, $.001 par value with 4,000,000 shares available for issuance.

 Common Stock

   In connection with the sale of its common stock in 1992, the Company agreed
with certain stockholders to redeem, at the stockholders' option, 801,000
shares of common stock anytime after June 29, 1995. The initial redemption
value was $1.00 per share and increased each year in accordance with the
agreement. These redemption rights terminated in February 1999 upon the
effectiveness of the Company's initial public offering. The redemption value at
termination was $1,423,000.

   In February 1999, the Company completed the sale of 3,029,466 shares of its
common stock in its initial public offering for proceeds of approximately
$34,874,000, net of expenses of the offering.

   In June 2000, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation (UTC)
purchased 307,882 shares of common stock for aggregate consideration of
$9,951,000, net of expenses. In connection with the equity investment, the
Company also issued warrants to UTC for the purchase of 307,882 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $38.00. The Company valued the warrants
issued using the Black-Scholes method using assumptions of an expected life of
three years and a volatility of 91%. The proceeds of the sale of the common
stock and warrants were allocated to each based on the relative fair value
resulting in a charge to operations of $6,041,000. The warrants were fully
vested and exercisable upon issuance.

   Shares reserved for future issuance were 3,468,811 at June 30, 2000.

Equity Plans

 1989 Stock Option Plan

   The Company adopted the Bottomline Technologies, Inc. Stock Option Plan, as
amended, (the Plan) on August 1, 1989, which provides for the issuance of
incentive stock options and nonstatutory stock options. The Plan is
administered by the Board of Directors, which has the authority to determine to
whom options may be granted, the period of exercise and what other
restrictions, if any, should apply. Vesting for options granted under the Plan
is principally over three years from the date of the grant. The Company has
reserved up to 1,440,000 shares of its common stock for issuance under the
Plan. Incentive stock options may be granted to employees at a price of no less
than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant.
Options expire a maximum of ten years from the date of grant.

 1997 Stock Incentive Plan

   On August 21, 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan (the
1997 Plan), which provides for the issuance of stock options and nonstatutory
stock options. The 1997 Plan is administered by the Board of Directors which
has the authority to determine to whom options may be granted, the period of
exercise and what other restrictions, if any, should apply. Vesting for options
granted under the 1997 Plan is principally over four years from the date of the
grant. The Company has reserved up to 2,700,000 shares of its common stock for
issuance under the 1997 Plan to employees at a price of no less than 100% of
the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant. Options expire
a maximum of ten years from the date of grant.

 1998 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan

   On November 12, 1998, the Company adopted the 1998 Non-Employee Director
Stock Option Plan (the Director Plan), which provides for the issuance of non-
statutory stock options. The Company has reserved up to 300,000 shares of its
common stock for issuance under the Director Plan. Under the terms of the
Director Plan, each non-employee director is granted an option to purchase
15,000 shares of common stock upon his or her initial election to the Board of
Directors. Such options vest ratably over four years from the date of the
grant. Additionally, each non-employee director is granted an option to
purchase 7,500 shares of common stock at each annual meeting of stockholders
following the annual meeting of the initial year of the election. Such options
principally vest over one year from the date of the grant.

 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

   On November 12, 1998, the Company adopted the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the Stock Purchase Plan), which provides for the issuance of up to a
total of 750,000 shares of common stock to participating employees. Eligible
employees may contribute between 1% and 10% of their base pay to the Stock
Purchase Plan. At the end of a designated offering period, employees purchase
shares of the Company's common stock with their contributions at an amount
equal to 85% of the closing market price per share of the common stock on
either the first day or the last day of the offering period, whichever is
lower.

 Stock-Based Compensation

   The Company has elected to follow APB 25, and related interpretations in
accounting for its employee stock options because, as discussed below, the
alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS 123 requires the use
of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee
stock options. Under APB 25, as the exercise price of the Company's employee
stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of
grant, no compensation expense is recognized.

   Option valuation models have been developed for use in estimating the fair
value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. Such models require the input of highly subjective assumptions.
Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options. The following
assumptions were made for grants in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively:

   Volatility...............................        --         45.0%       91.0%
</TABLE>

   For purposes of the required pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value
of the options is amortized over the options' vesting period. Had compensation
cost for the Company's stock option plan been determined based on the fair
value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with the
Black-Scholes method subsequent to the Company's initial public offering in
February 1999 and the minimum value method prior to February 1999, the
Company's pro forma net income (loss) and pro forma earnings (loss) per share
available to common stockholders would have been as follows:

   As the provisions of SFAS 123 are effective only for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1994, the effects of applying SFAS 123 for pro forma
disclosures are not necessarily representative of the effects on net income
(loss) for future years.

   A summary of option activity is as follows:

Warrants

   In connection with the sale of its common stock in March 1992, the Company
issued warrants for the purchase of an aggregate 644,000 shares of common stock
at exercise prices ranging from $1.00 to $2.00 per share. During 1999, the
remaining warrants outstanding of 143,000 shares were exercised at a weighted
average price of $1.19.

   In April 2000, the Company issued warrants to a company for the right to
purchase up to 324,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $55.00.
The warrants were fully vested and exercisable upon issuance. At June 30, 2000,
none of these warrants had been exercised. The Company valued the warrants
issued using the Black-Scholes method using assumptions of an expected life of
three years and a volatility of 91%. The value of the warrants, $5,861,000, was
charged to the results of operations.

   Options for 18,000 and 1,966,000 shares for the years ended June 30, 1999
and 2000, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings

shares for the year ended June 30, 2000 were excluded from the calculation of
diluted earnings per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

11. Income Taxes

   The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109. SFAS
No. 109 requires the use of the liability method in which income taxes reflect
the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   The principal non-deductible expense for income tax purposes is a warrant
that is not deductible for income tax purposes and goodwill amortization on a
stock acquisition.

   SFAS 109 requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets
reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not,
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. After
consideration of all the evidence, both positive and negative, management has
determined that a $2,328,000 valuation allowance at June 30, 2000 is necessary
to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not
be realized. The change in the valuation allowance for the current year is
$2,328,000.

   In addition to the above deferred tax assets, the company also has available
$1,308,000 of tax benefit attributable to the exercise of non-qualified stock
options. When realized, the associated benefit will be recognized as an
increase to additional paid-in capital.

12. Subsequent Events

   On August 28, 2000, the Company acquired the stock of two companies,
Checkpoint Holdings, Ltd. (Checkpoint) and Flashpoint, Inc. (Flashpoint).

   Checkpoint is an eCommerce and electronic payments software provider. The
purchase price for Checkpoint was approximately $82 million, with $15 million
paid in cash, $20 million in the form of a promissory note, 1,350,000 newly
issued shares of common stock, a warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of common
stock at a price of $50 per share and acquisition related costs. The
transaction will be accounted for as a purchase and Checkpoint's financial
results will be included with the Company's results from the acquisition date.

   Flashpoint is a professional software development company. The purchase
price was approximately $14.5 million, consisting of $4.5 million in cash,
242,200 newly issued shares of common stock, the assumption of all outstanding
stock options of Flashpoint and acquisition related costs. The transaction will
be accounted for as a purchase and Flashpoint's results will be included in the
Company's results from the acquisition date.

   The Company is evaluating and making preliminary assessments of the purchase
price allocation. The Company's early assessment is that a significant amount
of the purchase price will result in identifiable intangibles and goodwill and
will result in significant amounts of amortization in future years, including
fiscal year 2001. The Company's analysis is not yet complete but the Company
estimates the expected useful life to be in the three to five year range.

   In August 2000, we entered into a ten-year lease for approximately 83,000
square feet of space for a new headquarters facility in Portsmouth, New
Hampshire. Total lease payments for this new facility will be approximately $15
million.

   In August 2000, we made a $900,000 equity investment in Princeton eCom, an
electronic bill presentment and payment services provider, and a $500,000
equity investment in Magnet Corporation, a business-to-business e-finance
infrastructure and services provider. Both of these investments will be
accounted for on the cost basis.

           THIS WARRANT AND THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUED UPON ITS
                   EXERCISE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RESTRICTIONS ON
                 TRANSFER SET FORTH IN SECTION 4 OF THIS WARRANT
               ---------------------------------------------------

Date of Issuance: June 9, 2000                         Number of Shares: 307,882

                       BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES (DE), INC.
                       ----------------------------------

                          Common Stock Purchase Warrant
                          -----------------------------

     Bottomline Technologies (de), Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
for value received, hereby certifies that Nevada Bond Investment Corp. II or its
registered assigns (the "Registered Holder"), is entitled, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth below, to purchase from the Company, at any time or
from time to time on or after the date of issuance and on or before (i) the
closing of a Sale of the Company (as defined in Section 2(e)) or (ii) the third
anniversary of the date of issuance of this Warrant, 307,882 shares of Common
Stock, $.001 par value per share, of the Company, at a purchase price of $38.00
per share. The shares purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant, and the
purchase price per share, each as adjusted from time to time pursuant to the
provisions of this Warrant, are hereinafter referred to as the "Warrant Shares"
and the "Purchase Price," respectively.

     1.   Exercise.
          --------

          (a) This Warrant may be exercised by the Registered Holder, in whole
or in part, by surrendering this Warrant, with the purchase form appended hereto
as Exhibit I duly executed by the Registered Holder or by the Registered
   ---------
Holder's duly authorized attorney, at the principal office of the Company, or at
such other office or agency as the Company may designate, accompanied by payment
in full, in lawful money of the United States, of the Purchase Price payable in
respect of the number of Warrant Shares purchased upon such exercise.

          (b) The Registered Holder may, at its option, elect to pay some or all
of the Purchase Price payable upon an exercise of this Warrant by cancelling a
portion of this Warrant exercisable for such number of Warrant Shares as is
determined by dividing (i) the total Purchase Price payable in respect of the
number of Warrant Shares being purchased upon such exercise by (ii) the excess
of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock (as defined below) as of the
Exercise Date (as defined in subsection 1(c) below) over the Purchase Price per
share. If the Registered Holder wishes to exercise this Warrant pursuant to this
method of payment with respect to the maximum number of Warrant Shares
purchasable pursuant to this method, then the number of Warrant Shares so
purchasable shall be equal to the total number of Warrant Shares, minus the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of Warrant Shares by

                                      -1-
<PAGE>

(y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Purchase Price per share and
the denominator of which shall be the Fair Market Value per share of Common
Stock as of the Exercise Date. The Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock
shall be determined as follows:

          (i) If the Common Stock is listed on a national securities exchange,
the Nasdaq National Market or another nationally recognized trading system as of
the Exercise Date, the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock shall be
deemed to be the average of the high and low reported sale prices per share of
Common Stock thereon on the trading day immediately preceding the Exercise Date
(provided that if no such price is reported on such day, the Fair Market Value
per share of Common Stock shall be determined pursuant to clause (ii)).

          (ii) If the Common Stock is not listed on a national securities
exchange, the Nasdaq National Market or another nationally recognized trading
system as of the Exercise Date, the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock
shall be deemed to be the amount most recently determined by the Board of
Directors to represent the fair market value per share of the Common Stock
(including without limitation a determination for purposes of granting Common
Stock options or issuing Common Stock under an employee benefit plan of the
Company); and, upon request of the Registered Holder, the Board of Directors (or
a representative thereof) shall promptly notify the Registered Holder of the
Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Board of Directors has not made such a determination within the three-month
period prior to the Exercise Date, then (A) the Board of Directors shall make a
determination of the Fair Market Value per share of the Common Stock within 15
days of a request by the Registered Holder that it do so, and (B) the exercise
of this Warrant pursuant to this subsection 1(b) shall be delayed until such
determination is made.

          (c) Each exercise of this Warrant shall be deemed to have been
effected immediately prior to the close of business on the day on which this
Warrant shall have been surrendered to the Company as provided in subsection
1(a) above (the "Exercise Date"). At such time, the person or persons in whose
name or names any certificates for Warrant Shares shall be issuable upon such
exercise as provided in subsection 1(d) below shall be deemed to have become the
holder or holders of record of the Warrant Shares represented by such
certificates.

          (d) As soon as practicable after the exercise of this Warrant in full
or in part, and in any event within 10 days thereafter, the Company, at its
expense, will cause to be issued in the name of, and delivered to, the
Registered Holder, or as such Holder (upon payment by such Holder of any
applicable transfer taxes) may direct:

          (i) a certificate or certificates for the number of full Warrant
Shares to which the Registered Holder shall be entitled upon such exercise plus,
in lieu of any

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

fractional share to which the Registered Holder would otherwise be entitled,
cash in an amount determined pursuant to Section 3 hereof; and

          (ii) in case such exercise is in part only, a new warrant or warrants
(dated the date hereof) of like tenor, calling in the aggregate on the face or
faces thereof for the number of Warrant Shares equal (without giving effect to
any adjustment therein) to the number of such shares called for on the face of
this Warrant minus the sum of (a) the number of such shares purchased by the
Registered Holder upon such exercise plus (b) the number of Warrant Shares (if
any) covered by the portion of this Warrant cancelled in payment of the Purchase
Price payable upon such exercise pursuant to subsection 1(b) above.

     2.   Adjustments.
          -----------

          (a) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Company shall
              --------------------------------------------
at any time or from time to time after the date on which this Warrant was first
issued (the "Original Issue Date") effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock, the Purchase Price then in effect immediately before that
subdivision shall be proportionately decreased. If the Company shall at any time
or from time to time after the Original Issue Date combine the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, the Purchase Price then in effect immediately before the
combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this
paragraph shall become effective at the close of business on the date the
subdivision or combination becomes effective.

          (b) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event
              --------------------------------------------------
the Company at any time, or from time to time after the Original Issue Date
shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in
additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the Purchase
Price then in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the
time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed,
as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the Purchase
Price then in effect by a fraction:

               (1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
          Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of
          such issuance or the close of business on such record date, and

               (2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares
          of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time
          of such issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the
          number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend
          or distribution;

provided, however, if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend
is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed
therefor, the Purchase Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of
business on such

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

record date and thereafter the Purchase Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
paragraph as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions.

          (c) Adjustment in Number of Warrant Shares. When any adjustment is
              --------------------------------------
required to be made in the Purchase Price pursuant to subsections 2(a) or 2(b),
the number of Warrant Shares purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall
be changed to the number determined by dividing (i) an amount equal to the
number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to
such adjustment, multiplied by the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to
such adjustment, by (ii) the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such
adjustment.

          (d) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event
              -------------------------------------------------
the Company at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall
make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common
Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in
securities of the Company (other than shares of Common Stock) or in cash or
other property (other than cash out of earnings or earned surplus, determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), then and in each such
event provision shall be made so that the Registered Holder shall receive upon
exercise hereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
hereunder, the kind and amount of securities of the Company and/or cash and
other property which the Registered Holder would have been entitled to receive
had this Warrant been exercised into Common Stock on the date of such event and
had the Registered Holder thereafter, during the period from the date of such
event to and including the Exercise Date, retained any such securities
receivable, giving application to all adjustments called for during such period
under this Section 2 with respect to the rights of the Registered Holder.

          (e) Adjustment for Mergers or Reorganizations, etc. If there shall
              ----------------------------------------------
occur any reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation or merger involving
the Company in which the Common Stock is converted into or exchanged for
securities, cash or other property (other than a Sale of the Company transaction
(as defined below) or a transaction covered by subsections 2(a), 2(b) or 2(d)),
then, following any such reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation or
merger, the Registered Holder shall receive upon exercise hereof the kind and
amount of securities, cash or other property which the Registered Holder would
have been entitled to receive if, immediately prior to such reorganization,
recapitalization, consolidation or merger, the Registered Holder had held the
number of shares of Common Stock subject to this Warrant. In any such case,
appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of
the Company) shall be made in the application of the provisions set forth herein
with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Registered Holder, to
the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 2 (including provisions
with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Purchase Price) shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any
securities, cash or other property thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of
this Warrant. For the purposes hereof, a "Sale of the Company" shall mean (i)
the sale of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of the

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

Company or (ii) the acquisition of the Company by means of a reorganization,
merger, consolidation or recapitalization unless the owners of the capital stock
of the Company before such transaction continue to own after such transaction
more than 50% of the capital stock of the acquiring or succeeding entity in
substantially the same proportions as held prior to such transaction.

          (f) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each
              -----------------------------
adjustment or readjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2, the
Company at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to the Registered Holder a
certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment (including the kind
and amount of securities, cash or other property for which this Warrant shall be
exercisable and the Purchase Price) and showing in detail the facts upon which
such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Company shall, upon the written
request at any time of the Registered Holder, furnish or cause to be furnished
to the Registered Holder a certificate setting forth (i) the Purchase Price then
in effect and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any,
of other securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the
exercise of this Warrant.

     3.   Fractional Shares. The Company shall not be required upon the exercise
          -----------------
of this Warrant to issue any fractional shares, but shall make an adjustment
therefor in cash on the basis of the Fair Market Value per share of Common
Stock, as determined pursuant to subsection1(b) above.

     4.   Requirements for Transfer.
          --------------------------

          (a) This Warrant and the Warrant Shares shall not be sold or
transferred unless either (i) they first shall have been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), or (ii) the Company first shall
have been furnished with an opinion of legal counsel, reasonably satisfactory to
the Company (it being acknowledged that Kirkpatrick & Lockhart LLP shall be
deemed satisfactory), to the effect that such sale or transfer is exempt from
the registration requirements of the Act.

          (b) Each certificate representing Warrant Shares shall bear a legend
substantially in the following form:

               "The securities represented by this certificate have not been
               registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may
               not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred, pledged or
               hypothecated unless and until such securities are registered
               under such Act or an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the
               Company is obtained to the effect that such registration is not
               required."

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

     The foregoing legend shall be removed from the certificates representing
any Warrant Shares, at the request of the holder thereof, at such time as they
become eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Act. The Company
shall cause the legend to be removed upon the registration of the Warrant Shares
pursuant to that certain Investor Rights Agreement dated of even date herewith
between the Company and the Registered Holder.

     5.   No Impairment. The Company will not, by amendment of its charter or
          -------------
through reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution,
issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, but
will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and
in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to
protect the rights of the holder of this Warrant against impairment.

     6.   Notices of Record Date, etc. In the event:
          ----------------------------

          (a) the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock
(or other stock or securities at the time deliverable upon the exercise of this
Warrant) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend
or other distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any
shares of stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other
right; or

          (b) of any capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification
of the Common Stock of the Company, any consolidation or merger of the Company
with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which
the Company is the surviving entity and its Common Stock is not converted into
or exchanged for any other securities or property), or any transfer of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company; or

          (c) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or
winding-up of the Company,

then, and in each such case, the Company will mail or cause to be mailed to the
Registered Holder a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date
for such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such
dividend, distribution or right, or (ii) the effective date on which such
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up is to take place, and the time, if any is to be fixed,
as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or
securities at the time deliverable upon the exercise of this Warrant) shall be
entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other stock or
securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up. Such notice shall be mailed at least ten days prior
to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice.

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

     7.   Reservation of Stock. The Company will at all times reserve and keep
          --------------------
available, solely for issuance and delivery upon the exercise of this Warrant,
such number of Warrant Shares and other securities, cash and/or property, as
from time to time shall be issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant.

     8.   Exchange of Warrants. Upon the surrender by the Registered Holder,
          --------------------
properly endorsed, to the Company at the principal office of the Company, the
Company will, subject to the provisions of Section 4 hereof, issue and deliver
to or upon the order of such Holder, at the Company's expense, a new Warrant or
Warrants of like tenor, in the name of the Registered Holder or as the
Registered Holder (upon payment by the Registered Holder of any applicable
transfer taxes) may direct, calling in the aggregate on the face or faces
thereof for the number of shares of Common Stock (or other securities, cash
and/or property) then issuable upon exercise of this Warrant.

     9.   Replacement of Warrants. Upon receipt of evidence reasonably
          -----------------------
satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of
this Warrant and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) upon delivery of an
indemnity agreement (with surety if reasonably required) in an amount reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, or (in the case of mutilation) upon surrender and
cancellation of this Warrant, the Company will issue, in lieu thereof, a new
Warrant of like tenor.

     10.  Transfers, etc.
          ---------------

          (a) The Company will maintain a register containing the name and
address of the Registered Holder of this Warrant. The Registered Holder may
change its or his address as shown on the warrant register by written notice to
the Company requesting such change.

          (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 4 hereof, this Warrant and
all rights hereunder are transferable, in whole or in part, upon surrender of
this Warrant with a properly executed assignment (in the form of Exhibit II
                                                                 ----------
hereto) at the principal office of the Company.

          (c) Until any transfer of this Warrant is made in the warrant
register, the Company may treat the Registered Holder as the absolute owner
hereof for all purposes; provided, however, that if and when this Warrant is
                         --------  -------
properly assigned in blank, the Company may (but shall not be obligated to)
treat the bearer hereof as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes,
notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

     11.  Mailing of Notices, etc. All notices and other communications from the
          -----------------------
Company to the Registered Holder shall be mailed by first-class certified or
registered mail, postage prepaid, to the address last furnished to the Company
in writing by the Registered Holder. All notices and other communications from
the Registered Holder or in connection herewith to the Company shall be mailed
by first-class certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, to the Company at
its principal office set forth below. If the Company should at any time change
the location of its principal office to a place

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

other than as set forth below, it shall give prompt written notice to the
Registered Holder and thereafter all references in this Warrant to the location
of its principal office at the particular time shall be as so specified in such
notice.

     12.  No Rights as Stockholder. Until the exercise of this Warrant, the
          ------------------------
Registered Holder shall not have or exercise any rights by virtue hereof as a
stockholder of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event (i) the
Company effects a split of the Common Stock by means of a stock dividend and the
Purchase Price of and the number of Warrant Shares are adjusted as of the date
of the distribution of the dividend (rather than as of the record date for such
dividend), and (ii) the Registered Holder exercises this Warrant between the
record date and the distribution date for such stock dividend, the Registered
Holder shall be entitled to receive, on the distribution date, the stock
dividend with respect to the shares of Common Stock acquired upon such exercise,
notwithstanding the fact that such shares were not outstanding as of the close
of business on the record date for such stock dividend.

     13.  Change or Waiver. Any term of this Warrant may be changed or waived
          ----------------
only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which enforcement
of the change or waiver is sought.

     14.  Section Headings. The section headings in this Warrant are for the
          ----------------
convenience of the parties and in no way alter, modify, amend, limit or restrict
the contractual obligations of the parties.

     15.  Governing Law. This Warrant will be governed by and construed in
          -------------
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware (without reference to
the conflicts of law provisions thereof).

           THIS WARRANT AND THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUED UPON ITS
                   EXERCISE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RESTRICTIONS ON
                 TRANSFER SET FORTH IN SECTION 4 OF THIS WARRANT
             -----------------------------------------------------

Warrant No. 1                                          Number of Shares: 324,000
                                                         (subject to adjustment)
Date of Issuance: April 4,  2000

                       BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES (DE), INC.
                       ----------------------------------

                          Common Stock Purchase Warrant
                          -----------------------------

     Bottomline Technologies (de), Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
for value received, hereby certifies that Citibank, N.A. or its registered
assigns (the "Registered Holder"), is entitled, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth below, to purchase from the Company, at any time on or
before (i) the closing of a Sale of the Company (as defined in Section 2(e)) or
(ii) the third anniversary of the date of issuance of this Warrant, 324,000
shares of Common Stock, $.001 par value per share, of the Company, at a purchase
price of $55.00 per share. The shares purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant,
and the purchase price per share, each as adjusted from time to time pursuant to
the provisions of this Warrant, are hereinafter referred to as the "Warrant
Shares" and the "Purchase Price," respectively.

     1.   Exercise.
          ---------

          (a) This Warrant may be exercised by the Registered Holder, in whole
or in part, by surrendering this Warrant, with the purchase form appended hereto
as Exhibit I duly executed by the Registered Holder or by the Registered
Holder's duly authorized attorney, at the principal office of the Company, or at
such other office or agency as the Company may designate, accompanied by payment
in full, in lawful money of the United States, of the Purchase Price payable in
respect of the number of Warrant Shares purchased upon such exercise.

          (b) Each exercise of this Warrant shall be deemed to have been
effected immediately prior to the close of business on the day on which this
Warrant shall have been surrendered to the Company as provided in subsection
1(a) above (the "Exercise Date"). At such time, the person or persons in whose
name or names any certificates for Warrant Shares shall be issuable upon such
exercise as provided in subsection 1(d) below shall be deemed to have become the
holder or holders of record of the Warrant Shares represented by such
certificates.

          (c) As soon as practicable after the exercise of this Warrant in full
or in part, and in any event within 10 days thereafter, the Company, at its
expense, will cause to be issued in the name of, and delivered to, the
Registered Holder, or as such Holder (upon payment by such Holder of any
applicable transfer taxes) may direct:

          (i) a certificate or certificates for the number of full Warrant
Shares to which the Registered Holder shall be entitled upon such exercise plus,
in lieu of any fractional share to

                                      -1-
<PAGE>

which the Registered Holder would otherwise be entitled, cash in an amount
determined pursuant to Section 3 hereof; and

          (ii) in case such exercise is in part only, a new warrant or warrants
(dated the date hereof) of like tenor, calling in the aggregate on the face or
faces thereof for the number of Warrant Shares equal (without giving effect to
any adjustment therein) to the number of such shares called for on the face of
this Warrant minus the number of such shares purchased by the Registered Holder
upon such exercise.

     2.   Adjustments.
          -----------

          (a) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Company shall
              --------------------------------------------
at any time or from time to time after the date on which this Warrant was first
issued (the "Original Issue Date") effect a subdivision of the outstanding
Common Stock, the Purchase Price then in effect immediately before that
subdivision shall be proportionately decreased. If the Company shall at any time
or from time to time after the Original Issue Date combine the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, the Purchase Price then in effect immediately before the
combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this
paragraph shall become effective at the close of business on the date the
subdivision or combination becomes effective.

          (b) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event
              --------------------------------------------------
the Company at any time, or from time to time after the Original Issue Date
shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in
additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the Purchase
Price then in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the
time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been fixed,
as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the Purchase
Price then in effect by a fraction:

               (1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
          Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of
          such issuance or the close of business on such record date, and

               (2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares
          of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time
          of such issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the
          number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend
          or distribution;

provided, however, if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend
is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed
therefor, the Purchase Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of
business on such record date and thereafter the Purchase Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to this paragraph as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or
distributions.

          (c) Adjustment in Number of Warrant Shares. When any adjustment is
              --------------------------------------
required to be made in the Purchase Price pursuant to subsections 2(a) or 2(b),
the number of Warrant Shares purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall
be changed to the number determined by dividing (i) an amount equal to the
number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to
such adjustment, multiplied by the Purchase Price in effect

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

immediately prior to such adjustment, by (ii) the Purchase Price in effect
immediately after such adjustment.

          (d) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event
              -------------------------------------------------
the Company at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall
make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common
Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in
securities of the Company (other than shares of Common Stock) or in cash or
other property (other than cash out of earnings or earned surplus, determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), then and in each such
event provision shall be made so that the Registered Holder shall receive upon
exercise hereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
hereunder, the kind and amount of securities of the Company and/or cash and
other property which the Registered Holder would have been entitled to receive
had this Warrant been exercised into Common Stock on the date of such event and
had the Registered Holder thereafter, during the period from the date of such
event to and including the Exercise Date, retained any such securities
receivable, giving application to all adjustments called for during such period
under this Section 2 with respect to the rights of the Registered Holder.

          (e) Adjustment for Mergers or Reorganizations, etc. If there shall
              ----------------------------------------------
occur any reorganization, recapitalization or consolidation involving the
Company in which the Common Stock is converted into or exchanged for securities,
cash or other property (other than a Sale of the Company transaction (as defied
below) or a transaction covered by subsections 2(a), 2(b) or 2(d)), then,
following any such reorganization, recapitalization or consolidation, the
Registered Holder shall receive upon exercise hereof the kind and amount of
securities, cash or other property which the Registered Holder would have been
entitled to receive if, immediately prior to such reorganization,
recapitalization or consolidation, the Registered Holder had held the number of
shares of Common Stock subject to this Warrant. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Company) shall be made in the application of the provisions set forth herein
with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Registered Holder, to
the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 2 (including provisions
with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Purchase Price) shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any
securities, cash or other property thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of
this Warrant. For the purpposes hereof, a "Sale of the Company" shall mean (i)
the sale of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of the Company or
(ii) the acquisition of the Company by means of a reorganization, merger,
consolidation or recapitalization unless the owners of the capital stock of the
Company before such transaction continue to own after such transaction more than
50% of the capital stock of the acquiring or succeeding entity in substantially
the same proportions as held prior to such transaction.

          (f) Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each
              -----------------------------
adjustment or readjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2, the
Company at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in
accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to the Registered Holder a
certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment (including the kind
and amount of securities, cash or other property for which this Warrant shall be
exercisable and the Purchase Price) and showing in detail the facts upon which
such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Company shall, upon the written
request at any time of the Registered Holder, furnish or cause to be furnished
to the Registered Holder a certificate

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

setting forth (i) the Purchase Price then in effect and (ii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or
property which then would be received upon the exercise of this Warrant.

     3.   Fractional Shares. The Company shall not be required upon the exercise
          -----------------
of this Warrant to issue any fractional shares, but shall make an adjustment
therefor in cash on the basis of the fair market value per share of Common Stock
on the date of exercise.

     4.   Requirements for Transfer.
          -------------------------

          (a) This Warrant and the Warrant Shares shall not be sold or
transferred unless either (i) they first shall have been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), or (ii) the Company first shall
have been furnished with an opinion of legal counsel, reasonably satisfactory to
the Company, to the effect that such sale or transfer is exempt from the
registration requirements of the Act.

          (b) Each certificate representing Warrant Shares shall bear a legend
substantially in the following form:

               "The securities represented by this certificate have not been
               registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may
               not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred, pledged or
               hypothecated unless and until such securities are registered
               under such Act or an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the
               Company is obtained to the effect that such registration is not
               required."

     The foregoing legend shall be removed from the certificates representing
any Warrant Shares, at the request of the holder thereof, at such time as they
become eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Act.

     5.   No Impairment. The Company will not, by amendment of its charter or
          -------------
through reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution,
issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, but
will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and
in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to
protect the rights of the holder of this Warrant against impairment.

     6.   Notices of Record Date, etc. In the event:
          ----------------------------

          (a) the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock
(or other stock or securities at the time deliverable upon the exercise of this
Warrant) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend
or other distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any
shares of stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other
right; or

          (b) of any capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification
of the Common Stock of the Company, any consolidation or merger of the Company
with or into

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Company
is the surviving entity and its Common Stock is not converted into or exchanged
for any other securities or property), or any transfer of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company; or

          (c) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or
winding-up of the Company,

then, and in each such case, the Company will mail or cause to be mailed to the
Registered Holder a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date
for such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such
dividend, distribution or right, or (ii) the effective date on which such
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up is to take place, and the time, if any is to be fixed,
as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other stock or
securities at the time deliverable upon the exercise of this Warrant) shall be
entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other stock or
securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up. Such notice shall be mailed at least ten days prior
to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice.

     7.   Reservation of Stock. The Company will at all times reserve and keep
          --------------------
available, solely for issuance and delivery upon the exercise of this Warrant,
such number of Warrant Shares and other securities, cash and/or property, as
from time to time shall be issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant.

     8.   Exchange of Warrants. Upon the surrender by the Registered Holder,
          --------------------
properly endorsed, to the Company at the principal office of the Company, the
Company will, subject to the provisions of Section 4 hereof, issue and deliver
to or upon the order of such Holder, at the Company's expense, a new Warrant or
Warrants of like tenor, in the name of the Registered Holder or as the
Registered Holder (upon payment by the Registered Holder of any applicable
transfer taxes) may direct, calling in the aggregate on the face or faces
thereof for the number of shares of Common Stock (or other securities, cash
and/or property) then issuable upon exercise of this Warrant.

     9.   Replacement of Warrants. Upon receipt of evidence reasonably
          -----------------------
satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of
this Warrant and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) upon delivery of an
indemnity agreement (with surety if reasonably required) in an amount reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, or (in the case of mutilation) upon surrender and
cancellation of this Warrant, the Company will issue, in lieu thereof, a new
Warrant of like tenor.

     10.  Transfers, etc.
          --------------

          (a) The Company will maintain a register containing the name and
address of the Registered Holder of this Warrant. The Registered Holder may
change its or his address as shown on the warrant register by written notice to
the Company requesting such change.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

          (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 4 hereof, this Warrant and
all rights hereunder are transferable, in whole or in part, upon surrender of
this Warrant with a properly executed assignment (in the form of Exhibit II
hereto) at the principal office of the Company.

          (c) Until any transfer of this Warrant is made in the warrant
register, the Company may treat the Registered Holder as the absolute owner
hereof for all purposes; provided, however, that if and when this Warrant is
properly assigned in blank, the Company may (but shall not be obligated to)
treat the bearer hereof as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes,
notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

     11.  Mailing of Notices, etc. All notices and other communications from the
          -----------------------
Company to the Registered Holder shall be mailed by first-class certified or
registered mail, postage prepaid, to the address last furnished to the Company
in writing by the Registered Holder. All notices and other communications from
the Registered Holder or in connection herewith to the Company shall be mailed
by first-class certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, to the Company at
its principal office set forth below. If the Company should at any time change
the location of its principal office to a place other than as set forth below,
it shall give prompt written notice to the Registered Holder and thereafter all
references in this Warrant to the location of its principal office at the
particular time shall be as so specified in such notice.

     12.  No Rights as Stockholder. Until the exercise of this Warrant, the
          ------------------------
Registered Holder shall not have or exercise any rights by virtue hereof as a
stockholder of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event (i) the
Company effects a split of the Common Stock by means of a stock dividend and the
Purchase Price of and the number of Warrant Shares are adjusted as of the date
of the distribution of the dividend (rather than as of the record date for such
dividend), and (ii) the Registered Holder exercises this Warrant between the
record date and the distribution date for such stock dividend, the Registered
Holder shall be entitled to receive, on the distribution date, the stock
dividend with respect to the shares of Common Stock acquired upon such exercise,
notwithstanding the fact that such shares were not outstanding as of the close
of business on the record date for such stock dividend.

     13.  Change or Waiver. Any term of this Warrant may be changed or waived
          ----------------
only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which enforcement
of the change or waiver is sought.

     14.  Section Headings. The section headings in this Warrant are for the
          ----------------
convenience of the parties and in no way alter, modify, amend, limit or restrict
the contractual obligations of the parties.

     15.  Governing Law. This Warrant will be governed by and construed in
          -------------
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware (without reference to
the conflicts of law provisions thereof).

specifically agreed that Tenant shall not be entitled to any setoff or
reduction of rent by reason of any failure of Owner to comply with the covenants
of this or any other article of this Lease. Tenant agrees that Tenant's sole
remedy at law in such instance will be by way of an action for damages for

regulations or requirements with respect thereto Tenant may, after securing,
Owner to Owner, satisfaction against all damages, interest, penalties and
expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees, by cash
deposit or by surety bond in an amount and in a company satisfactory to Owner,
contest and appeal any such laws, ordinances, orders, rules, regulations or
requirements provided same is done with all reasonable promptness and provided

constitute a default under any lease or mortgage under which Owner may be
obligated, or cause the demised premises or any part thereof to be condemned or
vacated Tenant shall not do or permit any act or thing to be done in or to the
demised premises which is contrary to law, or which will invalidate or be in
conflict with public liability, fire or other policies of insurance at any time

the building of which the demised premises form a part, or which shall or might
subject Owner to any liability or responsibility to any person or for property
damage. Tenant shall not keep anything in the demised premises except as now or
hereafter permitted by the Fire Department, Board of Fire Underwriters, Fire

therein over that in effect prior to the commencement of Tenant's occupancy.

imposed upon Owner by reason of Tenant's failure to comply with the provisions
of this article and if by reason of such failure the fire insurance rate shall,
at the beginning of this lease or at any time thereafter, be higher than it
otherwise would be, then Tenant shall reimburse Owner, as additional rent
hereunder, for that portion of all fire insurance premiums thereafter paid by
Owner which shall have been charged because of such failure by Tenant. In any
action or proceeding wherein Owner and Tenant are parties, a schedule or "make-
up" of rate for the building or demised premises issued by the New York Fire

premises shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated and of the
several items and charges in the fire insurance rates then applicable to said
premises. Tenant shall not place a load upon any floor of the demised premises
exceeding the floor load per square foot area which it was designed to carry and
which is allowed by law. Owner reserves the right to prescribe the weight and

installations shall be placed and maintained by Tenant, at Tenant's expenses, in
settings sufficient, in Owner's judgement, to absorb and prevent vibration,
noise and annoyance.

               underlying leases and to all mortgages which may now or hereafter
affect such leases or the real property of which demised premises are a part and
to all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and extensions of
any such underlying leases and mortgages. This clause shall be self-operative
and no further instrument of subordination shall be required by any ground or
underlying lessor or by any mortgagee, affecting any lease or the real property
of which the demised premises are a part. In confirmation of such subordination,

repaired and restored [illegible] subject to Owner's right to elect not to
restore the same as herein provided (d) If the demised premises are rendered
wholly [illegible] whether; or not the demised premises are damaged in whole or
in part the building shall be so damaged that Owner shall decide to demolish or
to rebuild it, then, in any of such events. Owner may elect to terminate this
lease by written notice to Tenant, given within 90 days after [illegible] or
casualty, specifying a date for the expiration of the lease, which shall not be

the [illegible] permitted by law, Owner and Tenant each hereby releases and
waives [illegible] right of recovery against the other or any one claiming
through or [illegible] each of them by way of subrogation or otherwise. The
foregoing release and waiver shall be in force only if both releasors' insurance
policies contain a clause providing that such a release or waiver shall not
invalidate the insurance, if, and to the extent, that such waiver can be
obtained on by the payment of additional premiums, then the party benefitting
from the waiver shall pay such premium within ten days after written demand or
shall be deemed to have agreed that the party obtaining insurance coverage shall
be free of any further obligation under the provisions herein with respect to
waiver of subrogation. Tenant acknowledges that Owner will not carry insurance
on Tenant's furniture and/or furnishings or any fixtures or equipment,
improvements, or appurtenances removable by Tenant and agrees that Owner will
not be obligated to repair any damage thereto or replace the same. (f) Tenant

Domain:        acquired or condemned by Eminent Domain for any public or quasi
               public use or purpose, then and [illegible] that event, the
term of this lease shall cease and terminate from the date of title vesting in
such proceeding and Tenant shall have no claim for the value of any unexpired
term of said lease and assigns to Owner, Tenant's entire interest in any such
award.

Assignment,    11. Tenant, for itself, its heirs, distributees, executors,

premises or any part thereof to be used by others, without the prior written
consent of Owner in each instance. Transfer of the majority of the stock of a
corporate Tenant shall be deemed an assignment. If this lease be assigned, or
if or - any part thereof be underlet or occupied by anybody other
than Tenant, Owner may, after default by Tenant, collect rent from the assignee
under-tenant or occupant, and apply the net amount collected to the [illegible]
herein reserved, but no such assignment, underletting, occupancy or collection
shall be deemed a waiver of this covenant, or the acceptance of the assignee,
under-tenant or occupant as tenant, or a release of Tenant from the further
performance by Tenant of covenants on the part of Tenant herein contained. The
consent by Owner to an assignment or underletting shall not in any wise be
construed to relieve Tenant from obtaining the express consent in writing of
Owner to any further assignment or underletting. (See Rider #63)

electric current shall not exceed the capacity of existing feeders to the
building or the risers or wiring installation and Tenant may not use any
electrical equipment which, in Owner's opinion, reasonably exercised, will
overload such installations or interfere with the use thereof by other tenants
of the building. The change at any time of the character of the electric service
shall in no wise make Owner liable or responsible to Tenant, for any loss,
damages or expenses which Tenant may sustain. (See Rider No. 38)

Access to      13. Owner or Owner's agents shall have the right (but shall not
Premises:      be obligated) to enter the demised premises in any emergency at

building or which Owner may elect to perform. Tenant shall permit owner to use
and maintain and replace pipes and conduits in and through the demised premises
and to erect new pipes and conduits therein provided they are concealed within
the walls, floor, or ceiling. Owner may, during the progress of any work in the
demised premises, take all necessary materials and equipment into said premises
without the same constituting an eviction nor shall the Tenant be entitled to
any abatement of rent while such work is in progress nor to any damages by
reason of loss or interruption of business or otherwise. Throughout the term
hereof Owner shall have the right to enter the demised premises at reasonable
hours for the purpose of showing the
<PAGE>

same to prospective purchasers or mortgagees of the building, and during the
last six months of the term for the purpose of showing the same to prospective
tenants. If Tenant is not present to open and permit an entry into the premises,
Owner or Owner's agents may enter the same whenever such entry may be necessary
or permissible by master key or forcibly and provided reasonable care is
exercised to safeguard Tenant's property, such entry shall not render Owner or
its agents liable therefor, nor in any event shall the obligations of Tenant
hereunder be affected. If during the last month of the term Tenant shall have
removed all or substantially all of Tenant's property therefrom. Owner may
immediately enter, alter, renovate or redecorate the demised premises without
limitation or abatement or rent, or incurring liability to Tenant for any
compensation and such act shall have no effect on this lease or Tenant's
obligations hereunder.

Vault,         14.  No Vaults, vault space or area, whether or not enclosed or
Vault Space,   covered, not within the property line of the building is leased
Area:          hereunder, anything contained in or indicated on any sketch, blue
               print or plan, or anything contained elsewhere in this lease to
the contrary notwithstanding. Owner makes no representation as to the location
of the property line of the building. All vaults and vault space and all such
areas not within the property line of the building, which Tenant may be
permitted to use and/or occupy, is to be used and/or occupied under a revocable
license, and if any such license be revoked, or if the amount of such space or
area be diminished or required by any federal, state or municipal authority or
public utility, Owner shall not be subject to any liability nor shall Tenant be
entitled to any compensation or diminution or abatement of rent, nor shall such
revocation, diminution or requisition be deemed constructive or actual eviction.
Any tax, fee or charge of municipal authorities for such vault or area shall be
paid by Tenant.

Occupancy:     15.  Tenant will not at any time use or occupy the demised
               premises in violation of the certificate of occupancy issued for
the building of which the demised premises are a part. Tenant has inspected the
premises and accepts them as is, subject to the riders annexed hereto with
respect to Owner's work, if any. In any event, Owner makes no representation as
to the condition of the premises and Tenant agrees to accept the same subject to
violations, whether or not of record.

Bankruptcy:    16.  (a) Anything elsewhere in this lease to the contrary
               notwithstanding, this lease may be cancelled by Owner by the
sending of a written notice to Tenant within a reasonable time after the
happening of any one or more of the following events: (1) the commencement of a
case in bankruptcy or under the laws of any state naming Tenant as the debtor;
or (2) the making by Tenant of an assignment or any other arrangement for the
benefit or creditors under any state statute. Neither Tenant nor any person
claiming through or under Tenant, or by reason of any statute or order of court,
shall thereafter be entitled to possession of the premises demised but shall
forthwith quit and surrender the premises. If this lease shall be assigned in
accordance with its terms, the provisions of this Article 16 shall be applicable
only to the party then owning Tenant's interest in this lease.

                    (b) It is stipulated and agreed that in the event of the
termination of this lease pursuant to (a) hereof, Owner shall forthwith,
notwithstanding any other provisions of this lease to the contrary, be entitled
to recover from Tenant as and for liquidated damages an amount equal to the
difference between the rent reserved hereunder for the unexpired portion of the
term demised and the fair and reasonable rental value of the demised premises
for the same period. In the computation of such damages the difference between
any installment of rent becoming due hereunder after the date of termination and
the fair and reasonable rental value of the demised premises for the period for
which such installment was payable shall be discounted to the date of
termination at the rate of four percent (4%) per annum. If such premises or any
part thereof be relet by the Owner for the unexpired term of said lease, or any
part thereof, before presentation of proof of such liquidated damages to any
court, commission or tribunal, the amount of rent reserved upon such reletting
shall be deemed to be the fair ad reasonable rental value for the part or the
whole of the premises so re-let during the term of the re-letting. Nothing
herein contained shall limit or prejudice the right of the Owner to prove for
and obtain as liquidated damages by reason of such termination, an amount equal
to the maximum allowed by any statute or rule or law in effect at the time when,
and governing the proceedings in which, such damages are to be proved, whether
or not such amount be greater, equal to, or less than the amount of the
difference referred to above.

               this lease other than the covenants for the payment of rent or
additional rent; or if the demised premises becomes vacant or deserted; or if

property whereupon the demised premises shall be taken or occupied by someone
other than Tenant; or if this lease be rejected under (S) 235 of Title 11 of the
U.S. Code (bankruptcy code); or if Tenant shall fail to move into or take
possession of the premises within fifteen (15) days after the commencement of
the term of this lease, then, in any one or more of such events, upon Owner
serving a written five (5) days notice upon Tenant specifying the nature of said
default and upon the expiration of said five (5) days, if Tenant shall have
failed to comply with or remedy such default, or if the said default or omission
complained of shall be of a nature that the same cannot be completely cured or
remedied within said five (5) day period, and if Tenant shall not have
diligently commenced during such [illegible] period, and shall not thereafter
with reasonable diligence and in good faith, proceed to remedy or cure such
default, then Owner may serve a written three (3) days' notice of cancellation
of this lease upon Tenant, and upon the expiration of said three (3) days this
lease and the term thereunder shall end and expire as fully and completely as if
the expiration of such three (3) day period were the day herein definitely fixed
for the end and expiration of this lease and the term thereof and Tenant shall
then quit and surrender the demised premises to Owner but Tenant shall remain
liable as hereinafter provided.

                    (2) If the notice provided for in (1) hereof [illegible]

amount, if any, of the rents collected on account of the lease or leases of the
demised premises for each month of the period, which would otherwise have
constituted the balance of the term of this lease. The failure of Owner to re-
let the premises or any part or parts thereof shall not release or affect
Tenant's liability for damages. In computing such liquidated damages there shall
be added to the said deficiency such xpenses as Owner may incur in connection
with re-letting, such as legal expenses, attorneys' fees, brokerage, advertising
and for keeping the demised premises in good order or for preparing the same for
re-letting. Any such liquidated damages shall be paid in monthly installments by
Tenant on the rent day specified in this lease and any suit brought to collect
the amount of the deficiency for any month shall not prejudice in any way the
rights of Owner to collect the deficiency for any month shall not prejudice in
any way the rights of Owner to collect the deficiency of any subsequent month by
a similar proceeding. Owner, in putting the demised premises in good order or
preparing the same for re-rental may, at Owner's option, make such alterations,
repairs, replacements, and or decorations in the demised premises as Owner, in
Owner's sole judgment considers advisable and necessary for the purpose of re-
letting the demised premises, and the making of such alterations, repairs,
replacements and/or decorations shall not operate or be construed to release
Tenant from liability hereunder as aforesaid. Owner shall in no event be liable
in any way whatsoever for failure to re-let the demised premises, or in the
event that the demised premises are re-let, for failure to collect the rent
thereof under such re-letting, and in no event shall Tenant be entitled to
receive any excess, if any, of such net rents collected over the sum payable by
Tenant to Owner hereunder. In the event of a breach or threatened breach by
Tenant of any of the covenants or provisions hereof, Owner shall have the right
of injunction and the right to invoke any remedy allowed at law or in equity as
if re-entry, summary proceedings and other remedies were not herein provided
for. Mention in the lease of any particular remedy, shall not preclude Owner
from any other remedy, in law or in equity. Tenant hereby expressly waives any
and all rights of redemption granted by or under any present or future laws in
the event of Tenant being evicted or dispossessed for any cause, or in the event
of Owner obtaining possession of demised premises, by reason of the violation by
Tenant of any of the covenants and conditions of the lease, or otherwise.

Fees and       19.  If Tenant shall default in the observance of performance of
Expenses       any term or covenant on Tenant's part to be observed or performed
               under or by virtue of any of the terms or provisions in any
article of this lease, then, unless otherwise provided elsewhere in this lease,
Owner may immediately or at any time thereafter and without notice perform the
obligation of Tenant thereunder. If Owner, in connection with the foregoing or
in connection with any default by Tenant in the covenant to pay rent hereunder,
make any expenditures or incurs any obligations for the payment of money,
including but not limited to attorney's fees, in instituting, prosecuting or
defending any action or proceeding, then Tenant will reimburse Owner for such
sums so paid or obligations incurred with interest and costs. The foregoing
expenses incurred by reason of Tenant's default shall be deemed to be additional
rent hereunder and shall be paid by Tenant to Owner within five (5) days of
rendition of any bill or statement to Tenant therefor. If Tenant's lease term
shall have expired at the time of making of such expenditures or incurring of
such obligations, such sums shall be recoverable by Owner as damages.

Building       20.  Owner shall have the right at any time without the same
Alterations    constituting an eviction and without incurring liability to
and            Tenant therefor to change the arrangement and/or location of
Management:    public entrances, passageways, doors, doorways, corridors,
               elevators, stairs, toilets or other public parts of the building
and to change the name number or designation by which the building may be known.
There shall be no allowance to Tenant for diminution of rental value and no
liability on the part of Owner by [illegible] annoyance or injury to business
arising from Owner or other Tenants making any repairs in the building or any
such alterations, additions and improvements. Furthermore, Tenant shall not have
any claim against Owner by reason of Owner's imposition of such controls of the
manner of access to the building by Tenant's social or business visitors as the
Owner may deem necessary for the security of the building and its occupants.

No Repre-      21.  Neither Owner nor Owner's agents have made any
sentations by  representations or promises with respect to the physical
Owner:         condition of the building, the land upon which

<PAGE>

               it is erected or the demised premises, the rents, leases,
expenses of operation or any other matter or thing affecting or related to the
premises except as herein expressly set forth and no rights, easements or
licenses are acquired by Tenant by implication or otherwise except as expressly
set forth in the provisions of this lease. Tenant has inspected the building and
the demised premises and is thoroughly acquainted with their condition and
agrees to take the same "as is" and acknowledges that the taking of possesion of
the demised premises by Tenant shall be conclusive evidence that the said
premises and the building of which the same form a part were in good and
satisfactory condition at the time such possesion was so taken, except as to
latent defects. All understandings and agreements heretofore made between the
parties hereto are merged in this contract, which alone fully and completely
expresses the agreement between Owner and Tenant and any executory agreement
hereafter made shall be ineffective to change, modify, discharge or effect an
abandonment of it in whole or in part, unless such executory agreement is in
writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement of the change,
modification, discharge or abandonment is sought.

End of         22.  Upon the expiration or other termination of the term of this
Term:          lease, Tenant shall quit and surrender to Owner the demised
               premises, broom clean, in good order and condition, ordinary
wear and damages which Tenant is not required to repair as provided elsewhere in
this lease excepted, and Tenant shall remove all its property. Tenant's
obligation to observe or perform this covenant shall survive the expiration or
other termination of this lease. If the last day of the term of this Lease or
any renewal thereof, falls on Sunday, this lease shall expire at noon on the
preceding Saturday unless it be a legal holiday in which case it shall expire at
noon on the preceding business day.

Quiet          23.  Owner covenants and agrees with Tenant that upon Tenant
Enjoyment:     paying the rent and additional rent and observing and performing
               all the terms, covenants and conditions, on Tenant's part to be
observed and performed, Tenant may peaceably and quietly enjoy the premises
hereby demised, subject, nevertheless, to the terms and conditions of this lease
including, but not limited to, Article 30 hereof and to the ground leases,
underlying leases and mortgages hereinbefore mentioned.

Failure        24.  If Owner is unable to give possession of the demised
to Give        premises on the date of the commencement of the term hereof,
Possession:    because of the holding-over or retention of possession of any
               tenant, undertenant or occupants or if the demised premises are
located in a building being constructed, because such building has not been
sufficiently completed to make the premises ready for occupancy or because of
the fact that a certificate of occupancy has not been procured or for any other
reason. Owner shall not be subject to any liability for failure to give
possession on said date and the validity of the lease shall not be impaired
under such circumstances, nor shall the same be construed in any wise to extend
the term of this lease, but the rent payable hereunder shall be abated (provided
Tenant is not responsible for Owner's inability to obtain possession) until
after Owner shall have given Tenant written notice that the premises are
substantially ready for Tenant's occupancy. If permission is given to Tenant to
enter into the possession of the demised premises or to occupy premises other
than the demised premises prior to the date specified as the commencement of the
term of this lease, Tenant covenants and agrees that such occupancy shall be
deemed to be under all the terms, covenants, conditions and provisions of this
lease, except as to the covenant to pay rent. The provisions of this article are
intended to constitute "an express provision to the contrary" within the meaning
of Section 223-a of the New York Real Property Law.

No             25.  The failure of Owner to seek redress for violation of, or to
Waiver:        insist upon the strict performance of any covenant or condition
               of this lease or of any of the Rules or Regulations, set forth or
hereafter adopted by Owner, shall not prevent a subsequent act which would have
originally constituted a violation from having all the force and effect of an
original violation. The receipt by Owner of rent with knowledge of the breach of
any covenant of this lease shall not be deemed a waiver of such breach and no
provision of this lease shall be deemed to have been waived by Owner unless such
waiver be in writing signed by Owner. No payment by Tenant or receipt by Owner
of a lesser amount than the monthly rent herein stipulated shall be deemed to be
other than on account of the earliest stipulated rent, nor shall any endorsement
or statement of any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment as
rent be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Owner may accept such check or
payment without prejudice to Owner's right to recover the balance of such rent
or pursue any other remedy in this lease provided. No act or thing done by Owner
or Owner's agents during the term hereby demised shall be deemed an acceptance
of a surrender of said premises, and no agreement to accept such surrender shall
be valid unless in writing signed by Owner. No employee of Owner or Owner's
agent shall have any power to accept the keys of said premises prior to the
termination of the lease and the delivery of keys to any such agent or employee
shall not operate as a termination of the lease or a surrender of the premises.

Waiver         26.  It is mutually agreed by and between Owner and Tenant that
of Trial       the respective parties hereto shall and they hereby do waive
by Jury:       trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought
               by either of the parties hereto against the other (except for
personal injury or property damage) on any matters whatsoever arising out of or
in any way connected with this lease, the relationship of Owner and Tenant
[illegible] of said premises, and any emergency statutory or any other statutory
remedy. It is further mutually agreed that in the event Owner commences any
summary proceeding for possession of the premises, Tenant will not interpose any
counterclaim of whatever nature or description in any such proceeding including
a counterclaim under Article 4.

Inability to   27.  This Lease and the obligation of Tenant to pay rent
Perform:       hereunder and perform all of the other covenants and agreements
               hereunder on part of Tenant to be performed shall in no wise be
affected, impaired or excused because Owner is unable to fulfill any of its
obligations under this lease or to supply or delayed in supplying any service
expressly or impliedly to be supplied or unable to make, or is delayed in making
any repair, additions, alterations or decorations or is unable to supply or is
delayed in supplying any equipment or fixtures if Owner is prevented or delayed
from so doing by reason of strike or labor troubles or any cause whatsoever
including, but not limited to, government preemption in connection with a
National Emergency or by reason of any rule, order or regulation of any
department or subdivision thereof of any government agency or by reason of the
conditions of supply and demand which have been or are affected by [illegible]
or other emergency.

               required to give to Tenant, shall be deemed sufficiently given or

alterations necessary therefor without in any wise affecting this lease or the
obligation of Tenant hereunder. The same shall be done with a minimum of
inconvenience to Tenant and Owner shall pursue the alteration with due
diligence.

                    THIRD AMENDMENT AND EXTENSION OF LEASE

AGREEMENT entered into as of the 3/rd/ day of April 1998 by and between 60
CUTTER MILL ROAD PROPERTY CORP. ("Landlord") with offices at 60 Cutter Mill
Road, Suite 303, Great Neck, New York 11021, and INTEGRATED CASH MANAGEMENT
SERVICES, INC. ("Tenant"), with offices at Suite 601, 60 Cutter Mill Road, Great
Neck, New York.

WHEREAS, Landlord's predecessor in interest and Tenant entered into a lease
dated March 13, 1989 ("Original Lease"), pursuant to which Lease Landlord's
predecessor in interest leased to Tenant and Tenant leased from Landlord's
predecessor in interest certain premises known as Suite 601, 60 Cutter Mill
Road, Great Neck, New York ("Suite 601");

WHEREAS, the Original Lease was amended and modified by First Amendment and
Modification of Lease dated August 15, 1989 ("First Amendment") and the Original
Lease was further amended and modified and the term of the Original Lease
extended by Second Amendment and Modification of Lease dated October 28, 1993
("Second Amendment") (Original Lease, as so amended, modified and extended is
referred to herein as "Lease");

WHEREAS, Tenant desires to lease additional space pursuant to the terms of the
Lease, extend the term of the Lease and to modify certain other terms of the
Lease;

NOW, THEREFORE, Landlord and Tenant hereby agree as follows:

     1.   The term of the Lease is extended for a period of five (5) years
commencing July 1, 1999 and ending June 30, 2004.

     2.   (a) Effective the Substantial Completion Date (as that term is
defined below), "Demised Premises," (as that term is used in the Lease) shall
mean both Suite 601 and Suite 609, 60 Cutter Mill Road, Great Neck, New York
("Suite 609," comprised of 620 square feet). The Substantial Completion Date is
estimated to be on or about April 15, 1998, but Landlord makes no warranty or
representation as to what date the Substantial Completion Date will be.

(b)  Attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit A is a plan ("Plan"),
setting forth the work to be performed by Landlord to combine Suite 601 and
Suite 609 ("Landlord's Work"). Landlord's Work shall be in accordance with and
pursuant to Landlord's building standard. Landlord shall endeavor to minimize
the disruption of Tenant's business during such construction, but shall not be
liable for any temporary disturbance or interruption of Tenant's business. If
Tenant desires work to be performed which is in addition to or deviates from
Landlord's building standard, then the cost of such additional work, material,
installation or deviation will be at Tenant's sole cost and expense. Any changes
in Landlord's Work must be consented to by Landlord. Landlord shall give Tenant

shall compile a list of any remaining items of work which Landlord shall be
obligated to complete pursuant to the Lease, as hereby amended ("Punch List
Items"). The taking of possession of Suite 609 by Tenant shall be deemed an
acceptance of Suite 609, and Landlord shall thereafter proceed expeditiously to
complete the Punch List Items.
<PAGE>

(c) If Landlord is unable to give possession of Suite 609 because of the
holding-over or retention of possession of any tenant, undertenant or occupants,
or if Landlord's Work has not been substantially completed because of a holding
over or retention of possession of any tenant, undertenant or occupant or due to
force majeure, or for any other reason, Landlord shall not be subject to any
liability for failure to give possession on said date and the validity of the
lease shall not be impaired under such circumstances, nor shall the same be
construed in any way to extend the term of this lease, but the rent payable
hereunder for Suite 609 shall be abated (provided Tenant is not responsible for
Landlord's inability to obtain possession) until after Landlord shall have given
Tenant written notice that Suite 609 is ready for Tenant's occupancy. The
provisions of this Paragraph are intended to constitute "an express provision to
the contrary" within the meaning of Section 223-a of the New York Real Property
Law.

the Basic Rent for Suite 601 set forth in Paragraph 7 of the Second Amendment.

(b) During the period from July 1, 1999 through June 30, 2000, Tenant shall pay
Landlord Basic Rent for the Demised Premises (i.e., both Space 601 and 609) at

($290,377.00) per annum, payable in advance on the first day of each month in
monthly installments of TWENTY-FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY-EIGHT AND 08/100
DOLLARS ($24,198.08) without notice, demand or setoff.

Landlord Basic Rent for the Demised Premises at the rate of THREE HUNDRED
ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY-TWO AND 08/100 DOLLARS ($301,992.08) per annum,

TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-SIX AND 0l/l00 DOLLARS ($25,166.01)
without notice, demand or setoff.

(d) During the period from July 1, 2001 through June 30, 2002, Tenant shall pay

of TWENTY-SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN AND 55/100 DOLLARS ($27,219.55)

TWENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHT AND 33/100 DOLLARS ($28,308.33)
without notice, demand or setoff.

     4. Simultaneously with the execution of this amendment, Tenant
<PAGE>

shall deposit with Landlord an additional $2,552.73 to be held by Landlord as
security pursuant to Paragraph 34 of the Original Lease, so that total
security held by Landlord pursuant to the Lease shall be $44,952.73.

     5. Upon the Substantial Completion Date, Tenant shall be allotted one

in addition to the parking spaces allotted pursuant to Paragraph 56 of the

which conforms to building standard; (b) carpet the Demised Premises in a style

perform according to the terms of this Paragraph is a one-time-only, non-
recurring obligation.

     7. Landlord and Tenant acknowledge that there are two paragraphs of the
Second Amendment which are designated "Paragraph 9." The references in the
second Paragraph 9 and Paragraph 10 of the Second Amendment to Subparagraphs
8(a), 8(b) and 8(d) are deemed to refer to Subparagraphs (a), (b) and (d) of the

     months between the date of termination given in the Termination Notice and
     June 30, 2004, and the denominator of which is 75."

     9. Subparagraph 10(a) of the Second Amendment is deleted, and the following
inserted in its place:

     "(a) On the date of said Termination Notice, Tenant pays to Landlord: (i)
     the Termination Consideration computed pursuant to subparagraph (d) of the
     first Paragraph 9 hereof, plus (ii) 30% of the amount which would be due to

     notice hereunder."

     10.  Except as amended hereby, all other terms and conditions of the Lease
remain in full force and effect and shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant
in all respects.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Landlord and Tenant have set their hands as of the day and
year first above written.

                    FOURTH AMENDMENT AND EXTENSION OF LEASE

AGREEMENT entered into as of the 20/th/ day of July, 1999 by and between 60
CUTTER MILL ROAD PROPERTY CORP. ("Landlord"), with offices at 60 Cutter Mill
Road, Suite 303, Great Neck, New York 11021, and INTEGRATED CASH MANAGEMENT
SERVICES, INC. ("Tenant"), with offices at Suite 601, 60 Cutter Mill Road,
Great Neck, New York 11021.

WHEREAS, Landlord's predecessor in interest and Tenant entered into an Agreement
of Lease dated March 13, 1989 ("Original Lease"), pursuant to which Lease
Landlord leased to Tenant and Tenant leased from Landlord certain premises in
the building located at 60 Cutter Mill Road, Great Neck, New York 11021;

WHEREAS, the Original Lease was amended by (1) First Amendment and Modification
of Lease dated August 15, 1989, (2) Second Amendment and Modification of Lease
dated October 28, 1993 and (3) Third Amendment and Extension of Lease dated as
of April 3, 1998 (the Original Lease as so amended is referred to herein as the
"Lease");

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Lease, Tenant is currently occupying Suite 601 and
Suite 609 at the Building, comprising a total of approximately 11,020 square
feet; and

WHEREAS, Landlord and Tenant desire to extend the term of the Lease, add certain
additional space to the Demised Premises leased thereunder and modify certain
other terms of the Lease;

NOW, THEREFORE, Landlord and Tenant hereby agree as follows:

     1.   Capitalized Terms. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise
          -----------------
defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Lease.

     2.   Demised Premises. Effective as of the Substantial Completion Date (as
          ----------------
defined below) (but subject to Landlord receiving possession of the Additional
Space (hereinafter defined) from their present occupants), Suites 614, 615 and
616 (collectively, the "Additional Space") (as delineated on the floor plan
attached hereto as Exhibit A), comprising approximately 4,729 square feet, shall
be added to the Demised Premises, and the term "Demised Premises" as used in the
Lease shall mean Suite 601, 609, 614, 615 and 616.

     3.   Commencement Date; Term. Effective as of the Substantial Completion
          -----------------------
Date, the term of the Lease shall be extended such that the term, as hereby
amended (the "Amended Term"), shall commence on
<PAGE>

the Substantial Completion Date and shall expire at 11:59 p.m. on the day before
the tenth (10/th/) anniversary of the Substantial Completion Date (the
"Expiration Date"). At the request of either party, the other party shall
execute and deliver a commencement date acknowledgement notice, confirming the
Substantial Completion Date and the Expiration Date, as amended and extended
hereby.

     4.   Basic Rent. (a) During the period from the Substantial Completion Date
          ----------
through and including June 30, 2000, Tenant shall pay to Landlord Basic Rent at
the rate of FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY-SIX AND 16/100
DOLLARS ($414,986.16) per annum, payable in advance on the first day of each
month in monthly installments of THIRTY-FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY-TWO
AND 18/100 DOLLARS ($34,582.18) without notice, demand or setoff.

(b)  On each of July 1, 2000, July 1, 2001, July 1, 2002 and July 1 2003, the
annual Basic Rent payable pursuant to the Lease shall be increased to an amount
equal to the Basic Rent for the immediately preceding lease year plus four (4%)
percent of such amount. On July 1, 2004 and on each succeeding July 1 thereafter
during the term, the annual Basic Rent payable pursuant to the Lease shall be
equal to the lesser of (1) the annual Basic Rent for the immediately preceding
lease year plus five (5%) percent of such amount and (2) the annual Basic Rent
for the immediately preceding lease year "As Increased By CPI" (as such phrase
is defined below). In no event shall the Basic Rent payable hereunder be subject
to decrease.

(c)  As used herein, the phrase "As Increased By CPI" shall mean the amount
resulting from taking the Basic Rent in effect as at the preceding month of
June and multiplying same by the CPI (as defined below) for said June, then
dividing the result by the CPI for June of the year before said July 1 (i.e.,
the adjustment will reflect a one-year June change). In the event that such
increase is not known at a given July 1, then any adjustments relating back
shall be paid within 15 days following receipt by Tenant of a bill therefor. The
term "CPI" shall mean the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, New
York, New York, Northeastern New Jersey for All Items, as published by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. If such
index is changed in its make-up or application, it shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect the intent herein. If such index is discontinued, then the
most nearly comparable index shall be used.

(d)  Modifying Paragraph 38 of the Original Lease, Tenant acknowledges that the
Basic Rent payable hereunder includes an amount for Tenant's consumption of
electricity in the Demised Premises, and that such included amount is based upon
the assumption that (1) the Demised Premises shall be used as general offices
for a computer software company and (2) all of the electrically-operated
equipment in the Demised Premises shall be
<PAGE>

operated for an average of no more than sixty (60) hours a week plus useage for
computer servers, telephone systems, fax machines and security systems (the "24
x 7 Equipment"), which are operated 168 hours per week. If the Demised Premises
or any portion thereof is used in excess of such assumptions, then Tenant shall
pay for such overtime use as determined by a survey of an electrical consultant
to be chosen by Landlord, to be billed monthly and to be paid as additional rent
(or, at Landlord's option, to be included in the Basic Rent payable hereunder),
and Landlord shall have all rights and remedies for the collection thereof as
Landlord has for the collection of rents under the Lease. In the event a survey
is conducted by an electrical consultant chosen by Landlord as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence, then Tenant, within sixty (60) days after
notification from Landlord of the determination of said consultant, shall have
the right to contest, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, such determination by
submitting to Landlord within said sixty (60) day period a survey determination
prepared by an electrical consultant chosen by Tenant, which determination shall
highlight the differences between Landlord's survey and Tenant's survey. If the
determination of Tenant's consultant does not vary from the determination of
Landlord's consultant by more than ten (10%) percent, then the determination of
Landlord's consultant shall be binding and conclusive. If the determination of
Tenant's consultant shall vary from the determination from the determination of
Landlord's consultant by more than ten (10%) percent, and if Landlord's
consultant and Tenant's consultant shall be unable to reach agreement with
respect to such variance within thirty (30) days after the determination of
Tenant's consultant, then said consultants to make the determination, and the
determination of such third consultant shall mutually select in good faith a
third consultant shall be binding and conclusive. Landlord and Tenant shall
share the cost of such third consultant. In the event that said consultants
shall be unable to select a mutually acceptable third (30) day period, then
either party shall have the right to request the American Arbitration
Association in Nassau County to designate an additional consultant, the cost of
which shall be shared equally by the parties and whose determination shall be
binding and conclusive.

     5.   Security. On the Substantial Completion Date, Tenant shall deposit
          --------
with Landlord an additional $24,211.63 to be held by Landlord as security
pursuant to the Lease, so that the total security then held by Landlord pursuant
to the Lease (exclusive of interest accrued thereon, if any) shall be
$69,164.36.

     6.   Real Estate Taxes. (a) From and after July 1, 2004, Tenant shall pay,
          -----------------
as Additional Rent, 15.29% ("Tenant's Proportionate Share") of all taxes and
assessments, general and special, ordinary and extraordinary, and all other
impositions of every kind and nature whatsoever, which may be levied, imposed or
assessed by a governmental authority or other taxing authority during the Term
against the Demised Premises, the Land and Building
<PAGE>

and improvements and appurtenances, or any part thereof, the use of which is
available to Tenant (hereinafter jointly "Property"), and all taxes and
assessments upon any leasehold interests, to the extent that such taxes and
assessments exceed the Base Year total as hereinafter defined; provided,
however, for the tax years in which the Lease commences or expires the amount of
any excess for such tax year payable hereunder shall be pro rated between
Landlord and Tenant on the basis of the Commencement Date and the Expiration
Date.

(b)  "Base Year" shall mean (i) for a taxing authority whose tax year is the
calendar year, the 1999 calendar year, and (ii) for a taxing authority whose tax
year is not the calendar year, that taxing authority's fiscal tax year
1999/2000.

(c)  If any kind of tax or assessment whatsoever shall be charged against
Landlord partially or totally in substitution for real estate taxes and/or
assessments, same shall be deemed as a real estate tax for purposes of this
section of the Lease.

(d)  should any governmental authority having jurisdiction impose a tax and/or
assessment (other than franchise tax) upon or against the Rents payable
hereunder by Tenant to Landlord, or the occupancy by Tenant, such tax shall be
Tenant's obligation and responsibility, but if paid by Landlord, shall be deemed
Additional Rent and reimbursed to Landlord by Tenant within ten (10) days after
submission of a bill for same.

(e)  Tenant shall pay Tenant's Proportionate Share of such increase in taxes and
assessments to Landlord within fifteen (15) days after the submission of a bill
for same, provided however, upon written request of Landlord or mortgagee to
escrow such increases in taxes, Tenant shall pay Tenant's Proportionate Share of
such increase in taxes and assessments requested to be escrowed on a monthly
basis in amounts as determined by Landlord in good faith or in amounts as
determined by Landlord's mortgagee. If the monthly payments made by Tenant shall
be less than Tenant's Proportionate Share of the increase in such taxes and
assessments, then Tenant shall pay such deficiency to Landlord within fifteen
(15) days after written request. If Tenant's monthly payments shall exceed
Tenant's actual proportionate share of the increase in such taxes and
assessments, then such excess shall be applied against the next payment(s) due
pursuant to this Paragraph. Upon Tenant's request Landlord shall provide Tenant
with copies of tax bills which relate to any bill provided by Landlord to Tenant
pursuant to this Paragraph.

(f)  Tenant shall pay as aforesaid Tenant's Proportionate Share of all
assessments which may be levied, assessed, charged or imposed by a governmental
authority or other taxing authority upon the Land and Building or any part
thereof by reason of any public works or construction, provided that whenever
assessments or special assessments may be paid in installments, Landlord shall
enter into such agreement or agreements as are permitted by law to secure the
right and privilege of paying such assessments or special
<PAGE>

assessments in installments. In such case, the last such installment paid prior
to commencement or termination of this lease shall be pro rated between Landlord
and Tenant.

(g)  Tenant shall pay all personal property taxes levied on the merchandise,
equipment, appliances, fixtures, machinery, inventory, furniture and other
personal property and contents and leasehold value of the Demised Premises.

     7.   Renewal Option. Effective as of the Substantial Completion Date, and
          --------------
provided that Tenant shall not be in default (both on the date the renewal
option is exercised as well as on the day the renewal term is scheduled to
commence, and, with respect to non-monetary defaults only, beyond any applicable
notice and/or grace periods), Tenant shall have the one time right to extend the
term of the Lease for an additional five (5) year period. Tenant must deliver
written notice of its exercise of such option no later than six (6) months prior
to the Expiration Date (time being of the essence). All of the terms, provisions
and conditions of the Lease shall be applicable to such renewal term, except
that upon the commencement date of such renewal term, and on each anniversary of
such date thereafter, the annual Basic Rent shall be increased to an amount
equal to the Basic Rent for the immediately preceding lease year plus four (4%)
percent of such amount, payable in advance on the first day of each month in
equal monthly installments without notice, demand or setoff, and otherwise as
required under the Lease as hereby amended.

     8.   Option to Expand. From and after the Substantial Completion Date,
          ----------------
Tenant shall have the option to expand the Demised Premises to include available
additional space in the Building, provided the following conditions are
satisfied: (1) Tenant is not in default (both on the date Tenant's Expansion
Notice (hereinafter defined) shall be given as well as on the date the
additional space is scheduled to be added to the Demised Premises and, with
respect to non-monetary defaults only, beyond any applicable notice and/or grace
periods), (2) Tenant shall have previously exercised it's right to extend the
term of the Lease pursuant to Paragraph 7 above (or shall exercise such right
simultaneously with delivery of Tenant's Expansion Notice), (3) Tenant shall
have notified Landlord in writing that Tenant desires to expand the Demised
Premises by leasing additional space in the Building pursuant to this Paragraph
8 ("Tenant's Expansion Notice"), the amount of which additional space shall be
specified in Tenant's Expansion Notice and shall not be less than 1000 square
feet nor more than 6000 square feet and (4) additional space in the Building is
in fact then available for lease and delivery to Tenant, such available space is
at least 85% of the space requested by Tenant in Tenant's Expansion Notice and
Landlord shall have notified Tenant of such availability within three (3) months
after receipt of Tenant's Expansion Notice. In the event that any of the
conditions 1 through 3 above shall not have been satisfied, Tenant's right to
expand with respect to the additional space set forth in the applicable Tenant's
Expansion
<PAGE>

Notice shall be null and void and of no further force or effect. In the event
that such conditions 1 through 3 shall have been satisfied, such available
additional space shall be added to the Demised Premises and all of the terms
and provisions of the Lease shall be applicable thereto, except that:

     (a)  The Basic Rent for such additional space shall be at the rental rate
          per square foot which is the market rate for the Building at the time
          such space is added to the Demised Premises, as determined by Landlord
          (but in no event less than the rental rate per square foot then in
          effect for the Demised Premises), and such amount shall be added to
          the Basic Rent payable under the Lease with respect to the Demised
          Premises (and shall be subject to increase as provided in the Lease
          as amended hereby); and

     (b)  Tenant's Proportionate Share shall be increased to take into account
          the addition to the Demised Premises of such additional space, in an
          amount to be determined by Landlord.

     9.   Termination Option. (a) From and after September 1, 2004, Tenant shall
          ------------------
have the option, to be exercised upon no less than twelve (12) months prior
written notice to Landlord, to terminate the Lease (which notice shall specify
the effective date of such termination); provided that the following conditions
are satisfied: (a) Tenant is not in default (both on the date such notice shall
be given to Landlord as well as on .the effective date of' such termination),
(b) the effective date of such termination shall be the final day of a calendar
month and (c) simultaneously with such notice, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the.
following amounts: (i.) an amount equal to $1,300.00 multiplied by the number of
months remaining in the term of the Lease (as same may have been extended) after
such effective date, (ii) $145,750.00 (which amount shall be reduced by
$2,429.00 per month commencing October 1, 2004 and on the first day of each
month thereafter through the effective date of said termination) and (iii) an
amount equal to 25% of the amount which would have been due to Landlord as Basic
Rent from the effective date of such termination to the Expiration Date had the
Lease not been so terminated.

          (b) The "first" Paragraph 9 of the Second Amendment and Modification
of Lease, dated October 28, 1993, relating to Tenant's option to terminate the
Lease upon certain conditions, is hereby deleted in its entirety.

     10.  Parking. Upon the Substantial Completion Date, Tenant's allotted
          -------
parking spaces shall be increased such that Tenant shall be allotted a total of
thirty (30) reserved parking spaces and thirty-one (31) non-reserved parking
spaces.
<PAGE>

     11.  Landlord's Work. (a) Annexed hereto as Exhibit B (and initialed by
          ---------------
the parties) is a plan (the "Plan") setting forth the work to be performed by
Landlord at its sole cost and expense in connection with this Amendment
("Landlord's Work").  All such work shall be performed in a good and
workmanlike manner, using new materials, shall be in accordance with and
pursuant to Landlord's "Building Standard".  All construction drawings prepared
in connection with Landlord's Work shall be submitted to Tenant for its prior
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld and which approval
shall be deemed given if Tenant does not respond to such request for approval
within three business days after such submission by Landlord; it being
understood that Landlord will not perform the Landlord's Work delineated on any
such construction drawing until Tenant shall have approved (or shall be deemed
to have approved) same. If Tenant desires work to be performed which is not
delineated on the Plan and/or is above or deviates from Landlord's Building
Standard, then the cost of such additional work, material, installation or
deviation shall be at Tenant's sole cost and expense.  Any changes in the work
to be performed as delineated on the Plan must be consented to by the parties in
writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall have the right to make
any changes required by any governmental department or bureau having
jurisdiction of the Demised Premises, written notice of which shall be delivered
by Landlord to Tenant. Said work shall be performed by Landlord only once, it
being understood that Landlord's obligation to perform Landlord's Work is a
single, non-recurring obligation, subject to subparagraph 11(b) below.

     (b)  Landlord shall give Tenant at least seven (7), days notice prior to
any sheet-rocking of the walls Landlord may perform in connection with
Landlord's Work, and Landlord shall give at least ten (10) days prior written
notice to Tenant, setting forth the date on which Landlord anticipates that
Landlord's Work will be substantially completed and the Additional Space will be
ready for occupancy and available for delivery to Tenant (the date on which such
Landlord's Work shall have been substantially completed is hereinafter referred
to as the "Substantial Completion Date"). Within three (3) days after the
Substantial Completion Date, Landlord's representative and Tenant's
representative shall jointly examine Landlord's Work and shall compile a list of
any remaining items thereof which Landlord may be obligated to complete (i.e.,
so-called "punchlist" items). The taking of possession of the Additional Space
by Tenant shall be deemed to be Tenant's acceptance of same, but Landlord shall
thereafter diligently proceed to complete said punchlist items.

     12.  As Is; Failure to Give Possession. (a) Tenant hereby acknowledges that
          ---------------------------------
it is currently in occupancy of Suites 601 and 609 pursuant to the Lease, that
it has inspected same and is fully, familiar with the condition thereof and
Tenant accepts same in "as is" condition, subject to Landlord's obligation to
perform
<PAGE>

Landlord's Work with respect to such space (if applicable) and subject to
Landlord's other obligations under the Lease.

     (b)  Tenant hereby acknowledges that Suites 614 and 616 are currently
leased to and occupied by other tenants of the Building. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Amendment or in the Lease, in the
event that Landlord is unable to deliver possession of Suites 614, 615 and/or
616 to Tenant in the condition required hereby on or prior to the date which is
nine (9) months after the date hereof, whether because of the holding-over or
retention of possession of any such tenant, undertenant or occupants, or if
Landlord's Work cannot be completed by Landlord because of a holding over or
retention of possession of any such tenant, undertenant or occupant or due to
force majeure, or for any other reason (provided Tenant is not responsible for
same), then (1) this Amendment shall automatically be null and void and of no
further force or effect, and the Lease shall continue in accordance with its
terms without regard to this Amendment and (2) Landlord shall not be subject to
any liability for such failure to give possession, and the validity of the Lease
(without regard to this Amendment) shall not be impaired under such
circumstances, nor shall the same be construed in any wise to extend the term of
the Lease. The provisions of this Paragraph are intended to constitute "an
express provision to the contrary" within the meaning of Section 223-a of the
New York Real Property Law.

     13.  Suite 206.  From and after the date hereof through the Substantial
          ---------
Completion Date, Tenant shall be entitled to occupy Suite 206 in the Building,
which Suite 206 is comprised of approximately 3,264 square feet and which is
currently vacant, subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth in the
Lease as amended hereby except that (1) such occupancy shall automatically
expire and terminate on the date which is fifteen (15) days after the
Substantial Completion Date, (2) rent for such space shall be payable commencing
July 1, 1999 (which July 1 payment shall be paid by Tenant simultaneously with
its execution hereof) and shall be at the annual rate of $26.35 per square foot
(i.e, $7,167.20 per month) and (3) Tenant shall be entitled to an additional
twelve (12) parking spaces, six (6) of which shall be reserved and six (6) of
which shall be non-reserved. Effective as of the date which is fifteen (15) days
after the Substantial Completion Date, Tenant shall surrender said Suite 206 in
the manner and condition provided for in the Lease with respect to the surrender
of the Demised Premises, and this Paragraph 13 shall be of no further force or
effect. In the event that Tenant shall willfully fail to surrender Suite 206 on
the date which is fifteen (15) days after the Substantial Completion Date as
herein required (i.e., such failure is intentional and is not due to
                 ----
circumstances beyond Tenant's reasonable control), then rent during such
holdover period shall be equal to three times the rent payable with respect to
Suite 206 as provided above, Tenant hereby acknowledges that Landlord is in the
process of finalizing a lease for Suite 206 with a prospective tenant. Provided
same is not unreasonably disruptive
<PAGE>

to the operation of Tenant's business in Suite 206, any potential tenant for
said Suite shall have the right, following notice to Tenant from Landlord and
during the period of Tenant's occupancy of Suite 206, to enter said Suite in
order to prepare same for such tenant's occupancy. Tenant shall have the right
to have its representative present during any such entry, and if requested by
Tenant Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to cause any such entry to be
performed by such prospective tenant during non-regular business hours.

     14.  Miscellaneous. (a)  The total of the Demised Premises (inclusive of
          -------------
Suites 601, 609, 614, 615 and 616) is comprised of approximately 15,749 square
feet. Said area constitutes 15.29% of the total leasable space in the Building.

     (b)  If and to the extent the terms and provisions of this Agreement
conflict with or are inconsistent with the Original Lease as previously amended,
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall prevail and be controlling.

     15.  Ratification.  Except as modified hereby, the terms and provisions of
          ------------
the Lease remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and confirmed.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Landlord and Tenant have set their hands as of the day
and year first above written.

                    A. A portion of the twenty-eighth (28th) floor of the
Building is presently affected by a license dated May 24, 1998 between Owner, as
licensor, and Tenant, as licensee, for a term which expired on February 29,
2000, and Tenant, as licensee, continues to occupy the premises affected thereby
(said license, as may have been modified by any written agreements, including an
agreement dated March 24, 1998 is referred to as "Tenant's Existing License").
Tenant's Existing License and the term demised therein shall terminate and come
to an end on the date (referred to as the "Surrender Date") one (1) day prior to
the Commencement Date of this Lease, unless sooner terminated pursuant to any of
the terms, covenants or conditions of Tenant's Existing License or pursuant to
law. Tenant agrees to vacate and surrender to Owner the entire premises demised
in Tenant's Existing License free of all tenancies and occupancies on or prior
to the Surrender Date, as if the Surrender Date were the date originally fixed
for the expiration of the term demised in Tenant's Existing License, and Tenant
shall fully comply with the provisions of Tenant's Existing License on or prior
to the Surrender Date. If requested by Owner, Tenant agrees to execute and
deliver to Owner after the Surrender Date, a further agreement, in form
reasonably satisfactory to Owner, evidencing the surrender to Owner of the
premises demised in Tenant's Existing License; however, neither Owner's failure
to request such execution nor Tenant's failure to execute and deliver such
instrument shall vitiate the provisions of this Section 1.06.

                              B.   Provided Tenant, as licensee, is not then in
default under any of its obligations under Tenant's Existing License or this
Section, Tenant shall be released from its obligations under Tenant's Existing
License accruing after the Surrender Date, except as otherwise provided in this
Section. If Tenant shall vacate
<PAGE>

the premises demised in Tenant's Existing License or any part thereof at any
time prior to the Surrender Date, such premises or such part thereof shall be
deemed surrendered to Owner at such time. Nothing contained in this Section,
shall be deemed to affect Tenant's obligation to pay the license fee reserved in
Tenant's Existing License, and any increases therein, accruing with respect to
all periods to and including the Surrender Date, and regardless of when Tenant
shall vacate the premises demised in Tenant's Existing License, Tenant shall not
be entitled to any refund, abatement or apportionment of the License Fee or
annual rental rate reserved in Tenant's Existing License or any such increases
for such periods.

                              C.   All unpaid portions of the License Fee and
any increases therein and any additional fees due under Tenant's Existing
License with respect to all periods to and including the later of (i) the
Surrender Date or (ii) the date upon which Tenant shall vacate and surrender the
premises demised in Tenant's Existing License in accordance with the provisions
of this Section and Tenant's Existing License shall, at Owner's election, be
payable by Tenant to Owner as additional rent under this Lease.

                              D.   Tenant represents and warrants to Owner that
Tenant is not in default under any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
Tenant's Existing License and that Tenant has not at any time heretofore
committed or suffered, and will not at any time hereafter commit or suffer, any
act, deed, matter or thing whatsoever whereby the premises demised in Tenant's
Existing License or any part thereof are or shall be at any time hereafter in
any way impeached, charged, affected or encumbered. Tenant's obligations under
the applicable provisions of Tenant's Existing License shall survive the
expiration of the term thereof.

                              E.   Except to the extent expressly modified by
the foregoing provisions of this Section, Tenant's Existing License is hereby
ratified and confirmed in respects.

to any other tenant or occupant of the Building, or (ii) the proper and
economical rendition of any such service, or (iii) the use or enjoyment of any

          Section 3.01.  General Alteration Covenants:  Tenant shall not make or
                         ----------------------------
perform, or permit the making or performance of, any alterations, installations,

Premises (referred to collectively, as "Alterations" and individually as an
                                        -----------
"Alteration") without Owner's prior consent in each instance.  Owner agrees not
 ----------
unreasonably to withhold its consent to any non-structural Alterations proposed
to be made by Tenant to adapt the Demised Premises for Tenant's business
purposes.  Owner agrees that Tenant may, without Owner's prior written consent,
make any merely decorative changes and other non-structural Alterations in the
Demised Premises, the estimated cost of which constituting a single project
shall not exceed FIFTY THOUSAND and 00/100 ($50,000.00) DOLLARS and which shall
not affect the electrical, plumbing and heating, ventilation and air
conditioning systems in the Builiding or any portion of the Building outside the
Demised Premises.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section or
Owner's consent to any Alterations, all Alterations and decorations shall be
made and performed in conformity with and subject to the following provisions:

                         A.   All Alterations and decorations, shall be made and
performed at Tenant's sole cost and expense and at such time and in such manner
as Owner may, from time to time, designate;

                         B.   No Alteration shall adversely affect the
structural integrity of the Building;

                         C.   Alterations and decorations shall be made only by
contractors or mechanics approved by Owner, such approval not unreasonably to be
withheld (notwithstanding the foregoing, all Alterations requiring mechanics in
heating, ventilation, air conditioning, electrical, plumbing, sprinkler and
other mechanical trades with respect to which Owner has adopted or may hereafter
adopt a list or lists of approved contractors shall be made only by contractors
selected by Tenant from such list or lists provided there are at least three (3)
contractors on each such list and the prices charged by such contractors are
competitive for similar work in the Borough of Manhattan in comparable first
class office buildings);

                         D.   No Alteration or decoration shall affect any part
of the Building other than the Demised Premises or adversely affect any service
required to be furnished by Owner to Tenant or to any other tenant or occupant
of the Building (including, without limitation, the Building-wide standard
systems required to provide elevator, heat, ventilation, air-conditioning and
electrical and plumbing services in the Building);

                         E.   No Alteration shall reduce the value or utility of
the Building or any portion thereof;

                         F.   No Alteration shall affect the Certificate of
Occupancy for the Building or the Demised Premises;

                         G.   No Alteration or decoration shall affect the
outside appearance of the Building or the color or style of any venetian blinds
(except that Tenant may remove any venetian blinds provided that they are
promptly replaced by Tenant with blinds of a similar type, material and color);

                         H.   All business machines and mechanical equipment
shall be placed and maintained by Tenant in settings sufficient, in Owner's
judgment, to absorb and prevent vibration, noise and annoyance to other tenants
or occupants of the Building;

                         I.   Tenant shall submit to Owner detailed plans and
specifications stamped by Tenant's architect (including layout, architectural,
mechanical and structural drawings) for each proposed Alteration and shall not
commence any such Alteration without first obtaining Owner's approval of such
plans and specifications, such approval not unreasonably to be withheld or
delayed, notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not be required to submit
any detailed plans and specifications for any Alterations unless such plans and
specifications are, in the ordinary course, prepared for such Alterations or are
required to be prepared in connection with any filings or other applicable
requirements of any law, order, rule or regulation of any Federal, State, County
or Municipality, including but not limited to, the Department of Buildings of
the City of New York, and in those cases where Tenant shall not be

                                       4
<PAGE>

required to submit such detailed plans and specifications, Tenant shall submit
to Owner, in lieu thereof, information with respect to such Alterations in
reasonably sufficient detail so as to enable Owner to determine the nature and
extent of the work to be performed, and following the completion of each
Alteration, Tenant shall submit to Owner a computerized "as built" drawing file
for the Demised Premises (or if the Demised Premises comprise more than one (1)
floor, for each floor of the Demised Premises being altered) and in those cases
where Tenant shall not be so required to submit such detailed plans and
specifications, Tenant shall submit to Owner, in lieu thereof, information with
respect to such Alterations in reasonably sufficient detail so as to enable
Owner to determine the nature and extent of the work to be performed; such file
will be in DXF format and contain, on a separate layer, all ceiling-height
partitions and doors within the Demised Premises (or if the Demised Premises
comprise more than one (1) floor, within each floor of the Demised Premises
being altered);

                         J.   Prior to the commencement of each proposed
Alteration, Tenant shall have procured and paid for and exhibited to Owner, so
far as the same may be required from time to time, all permits, approvals and
authorizations of all Governmental Authorities (as defined in Section 6.01.)
having or claiming jurisdiction;

                         K.   Prior to the commencement of each proposed
Alteration and decoration, Tenant shall furnish to Owner duplicate original
policies of workmen's compensation insurance covering all persons to be employed
in connection with such Alteration or decoration, including those to be employed
by all contractors and subcontractors, and of comprehensive public liability
insurance (including property damage coverage) in which Owner, its agents, the
holder of any Mortgage (as defined in Section 7.01.) and any lessor under any
Superior Lease (as defined in Section 7.01.) shall be named as parties insured,
which policies shall be issued by companies, and shall be in form and amounts,
satisfactory to Owner and shall be maintained by Tenant until the completion of
such Alteration;

                         L.   In the event Owner or its agents employ any
independent architect or engineer to examine any plans or specifications
submitted by Tenant to Owner in connection with any proposed Alteration, Tenant
agrees to pay to Owner a sum equal to any reasonable out-of-pocket fees incurred
by Owner in connection therewith.

                         M.   All fireproof wood test reports, electrical and
air conditioning certificates, and all other permits, approvals and certificates
required by all Governmental Authorities shall be timely obtained by Tenant and
submitted to Owner;

                         N.   All Alterations and decorations, once commenced,
shall be made promptly and in a good and workmanlike manner;

                         O.   Notwithstanding Owner's approval of plans and
specifications for any Alteration, all Alterations and decorations shall be made
and performed in full compliance with all Legal Requirements (as defined in
Section 6.01.) and with all applicable rules, orders, regulations and
requirements of the New York Board of Fire Underwriters and the New York Fire
Insurance Rating Organization or any similar body;

                         P.   All Alterations and decorations shall be made and
performed in accordance with the Building Rules and Building Rules for
Alterations;

                         Q.   All materials and equipment to be installed,
incorporated or located in the Demised Premises as a result of all Alterations

lien, encumbrance, chattel mortgage or title retention or security agreement of
any kind;

<PAGE>

                         S.   Tenant, before commencement of each Alteration,
the estimated cost of which constituting a single project shall exceed ONE
HUNDRED THOUSAND and 00/100 ($100,000.00) DOLLARS shall furnish to Owner a
performance bond or other security satisfactory to Owner, in an amount at least
equal to the estimated cost of such Alteration, guaranteeing the performance and
payment thereof;

                         T.   No Alteration shall be commenced unless any
preceding Alteration shall have been fully paid for and proof of such payment
furnished to Owner;

                         U.   Following the completion of each Alteration,
Tenant, at Tenant's expense, shall obtain certificates of final approval of such
Alteration required by any Governmental Authority and shall furnish Owner with
copies thereof.

                         V.   Tenant agrees that Tenant will not install, affix,
add or paint in or on, nor permit, any work of visual art (as defined in the
Federal Visual Artists' Rights Act of 1990 or any successor law of similar
import) or other Alteration to be installed in or on, or affixed, added to, or
painted on, the interior or exterior of the Demised Premises, or any part
thereof, including, but not limited to, the walls, floors, ceilings, doors,
windows, fixtures and on land included as part of the Demised Premises, which
work of visual art or other Alteration would, under the provisions of the
Federal Visual Artists' Rights Act of 1990, or any successor law of similar
import, require the consent of the author or artist of such work or Alteration
before the same could be removed, modified, destroyed or demolished.

                         W.   Under no circumstances shall Tenant be permitted
to locate any telecommunications facilities in the telecommunications closets of
the Building. With respect to Tenant's telecommunications facilities, (i)
Tenant, without separate additional cost by Tenant payable to Owner, shall
contract separately with all providers of Tenant's telecommunications facilities

services provided by it to Tenant, and (ii) each Provider shall use,
exclusively, the telecommunications cable distribution system in the Building
designated by Owner and shall contract separately with the company providing

                         ------------------------------------------
this Lease shall be deemed or construed in any way as constituting the consent
or request of Owner, express or implied, by inference or otherwise, to any
contractor, subcontractor, laborer or materialmen, for the performance of any
labor or the furnishing of any material for any specific Alteration to, or
repair of, the Demised Premises, the Building, or any part of either.  Any
mechanic's or other lien filed against the Demised Premises or the Building or
the Real Property for work claimed to have been done for, or materials claimed

within ten (10) days after the filing of such lien.

          Section 3.03.  Labor Harmony:  Tenant shall not, at any time prior to
                         -------------
or during the Demised Term, directly or indirectly employ, or permit the
employment of, any contractor, mechanic or laborer in the Demised Premises,
whether in connection with any Alteration or otherwise, if such employment will
interfere or cause any conflict with other contractors, mechanics, or laborers
engaged in the construction, maintenance or operation of the Building by Owner,
Tenant or others.  In the event of any such interference or conflict, Tenant,
upon demand of Owner, shall cause all contractors, mechanics or laborers causing
such interference or conflict to leave the Building immediately.

                         ---------------------------

                                       6
<PAGE>

practices adopted by Owner for fire safety in the Building. No Alteration shall
affect all or any part of any Class E Fire Alarm and Communication system
installed in the Demised Premises, except that in connection with any such
Alteration Tenant may relocate certain components of such system, provided (i)
such relocation shall be performed in a manner first reasonably approved by
Owner, (ii) the new location of any such component shall be first reasonably
approved by Owner, (iii) prior to any such relocation Tenant shall submit to
Owner detailed plans and specifications therefor which shall be first reasonably
approved by Owner and (iv) Owner shall have the election of relocating such
components either by itself or by its contractors, in which event all reasonable
expenses incurred by Owner shall be reimbursed by Tenant upon demand of Owner,
as additional rent.

          Section 3.05.  Sprinklers:  The Demised Premises shall contain a
                         ----------
sprinkler system and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
Sections 5.01 and 6.01, Owner, at Owner's expense, shall perform routine
maintenance of, and shall repair and replace if necessary, said sprinkler system
and any replacements thereof, unless such repair or replacement is due to
Tenant's acts, omissions or negligence, in which event Owner shall repair or
replace same, at Tenant's sole cost and expense.  Owner shall also perform
controlled inspections of said sprinkler system as and when required by law and
Tenant shall give Owner reasonable access to perform such repairs, maintenance
and inspections.  Any sprinkler system and any replacements thereof whether made
at Tenant's expense or Owner's expense, shall be deemed the property of Owner.

          Section 3.06.  Hazardous Material:  If any Legal Requirement of any
                         ------------------
Governmental Authority requires that any hazardous material contained in or
about the Demised Premises and installed therein by Tenant or any person
claiming through or under Tenant be removed or dealt with in any particular
manner in connection with any Alterations of the Demised Premises or otherwise,
then it shall be Tenant's obligation, at Tenant's expense, to remove or so deal
with such hazardous material in accordance with all such laws, orders, rules and
regulations.  In the event Tenant is required to remove or so deal with such
hazardous material in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing sentence
then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Owner, at
Owner's election, shall have the option to itself remove or so deal with such
hazardous material and, in such event, Tenant shall pay to Owner all of Owner's
costs in connection therewith within ten (10) days next following the rendition
of a statement thereof by Owner to Tenant.

          Section 3.07.  Dispute Resolution:  Any dispute with respect to the
                         ------------------
reasonability of any failure or refusal of Owner to grant its consent or
approval to any request for such consent or approval pursuant to the provisions
of Section 3.01 with respect to which request Owner has agreed, in such Section
not unreasonably to withhold such consent or approval, shall be determined by
arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Article 36.

of the following equipment to any Class E Fire Alarm and Communication system
installed in the Demised Premises, Tenant shall pay to Owner as a one (1) time
connection fee the following sums set forth opposite the equipment listed below

Environmental Protection Form ACP5 dated 10/88 (or any successor form), signed
by a certified asbestos investigator, or any other form or approval required by
Federal, State, County or Municipal authorities, indicating that said
Alterations do not constitute an asbestos project, Owner agrees, upon notice
from Tenant to such effect, to perform such work as shall be required to enable

Section, in the event any work performed by Owner pursuant to the provisions of
either or both of such subsections is in any way disturbed or damaged by Tenant
or any person claiming through or under Tenant, or asbestos or other hazardous
material is installed in the Demised Premises by or on behalf of Tenant, or any
person claiming through or under Tenant, Owner shall have no responsibility in
connection with the disturbed or damaged work or the asbestos or other hazardous
material so installed by Tenant or any person claiming through or under Tenant

          Section 5.01.  Tenant's Repair Obligations:  Tenant shall take good
                         ---------------------------
care of the Demised Premises (including, but not limited to, any Class E Fire
Alarm and Communication system and any sprinkler system installed therein and
any installations made or equipment installed therein as a result of any
requirement of New York City Local Law #16 of 1984 or any successor law or like
import) and, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, shall make all repairs and
replacements, structural and otherwise, ordinary and extraordinary, foreseen and
unforeseen as and when needed to preserve the Demised Premises (including, but
not limited to, any Class E Fire Alarm and Communication system and any
installations made or equipment installed therein as a result of any requirement
of New York City Local Law #16 of 1984 or any successor law of like import) in
good and safe working order and in first class repair and condition, except that
Tenant shall not be required to make any repairs or replacements to the Demised
Premises unless necessitated or occasioned by the acts, omissions or negligence
of Tenant or any person claiming through or under Tenant or any of their
servants, employees, contractors, agents, visitors or licensees, or by the
manner of use or occupancy of the Demised Premises by Tenant or any such person
(in contradistinction to the mere use or occupancy of the Demised Premises for
the purposes set forth in Section 2.01).  Without affecting Tenant's obligations
set forth in the preceding sentence, Tenant, at Tenant's sole cost and expense,
shall also (i) make all repairs and replacements, and perform all maintenance as
and when necessary, to the lamps, tubes, ballasts, and starters in the lighting
fixtures installed in the Demised Premises, (ii) make all repairs and
replacements, as and when necessary, to Tenant's Personal Property and to any
Alterations made or performed by or on behalf of Tenant or any person claiming
through or under Tenant, and (iii) if the Demised Premises shall include any
space on any ground, street, mezzanine or basement floor in the Building, make
all replacements, as and when necessary, to all windows and plate and other
glass in, on or about such space, and obtain and maintain, throughout the
Demised Term, plate glass insurance policies issued by companies, and in form
and amounts, satisfactory to Owner, in which Owner, its agents and any lessor
under any ground or underlying lease shall be named as parties insured, and (iv)
perform all maintenance and make all repairs and replacements, as and when
necessary, to any air conditioning equipment, private elevators, escalators,
conveyors or mechanical systems (other than the Building's standard equipment
and systems) which may be installed in the Demised Premises by Owner, Tenant or
others.  However, the provisions of the foregoing sentence shall not be deemed
to give to Tenant any right to install air conditioning equipment, elevators,
escalators, conveyors or mechanical systems.  All repairs and replacements made
by or on behalf of Tenant or any person claiming through or under Tenant shall
be made and performed in conformity with, and subject to the provisions of
Article 3 and shall be at least equal in quality and class to the original work
or installation.   The necessity for, and adequacy of, repairs and replacements
pursuant to this Article 5 shall be measured by the standard which is
appropriate for first class office buildings of similar construction and class
in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York.

          Section 5.02.  Supplementing the provisions of Section 5.01, Owner, at
Owner's sole cost and expense, shall timely make (i) all structural repairs to
the Demised Premises and the Building as and when required, (ii) all repairs
necessary to furnish the plumbing, electrical, air conditioning, ventilating,
heating and elevator services required to be furnished by Owner to Tenant under
the provisions of Article 29, and (iii) all necessary repairs to the public
portions of the Building which affect Tenant's use and enjoyment of the Demised
Premises, except that Owner

                                       9
<PAGE>

shall not be required to make any of the repairs referred to in subdivision (i),
(ii) or (iii) of this sentence if Tenant is obligated to make such repairs
pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.01. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section, Owner shall have no obligation to make any repairs
unless and until specific actual notice of the necessity therefor shall have
been given to Owner.



                                   ARTICLE 6

          Section 6.01.  General Covenants:  Tenant, at Tenant's sole cost and
                         -----------------

of  the Demised Premises or the use or occupation thereof, including, but not
limited to, any requirement that asbestos or other hazardous material installed
in the Demised Premises by Tenant or any person claiming through or under Tenant
be removed or dealt with in any particular manner, except that Tenant shall not
be required to make any Alterations in order so to comply unless such
Alterations shall be necessitated or occasioned, in whole or in part, by the
acts, omissions, or negligence of Tenant or any person claiming through or under
Tenant, or any of their servants, employees, contractors, agents, visitors or
licensees, or by the manner of use or occupancy of the Demised Premises by
Tenant or by any such person (in contradistinction to the mere use or occupancy
of the Demised Premises for the purposes set forth in Section 2.01).  For all
purposes of this Lease the term "Legal Requirements" shall mean all present and
                                 ------------------
future laws, codes, ordinances, statutes, requirements, orders and regulations,
ordinary and extraordinary, foreseen and unforeseen (including, but not limited
to, the New York State Energy Conservation Construction Code, New York City
Local Laws #5 of 1973, #16 of 1984 and #58 of 1987 and the Americans with
Disabilities Act, and any successor laws of like import) of any Governmental

New York, the County of New York, the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New
York, any political subdivision thereof and any agency, department, commission,
board, bureau or instrumentality of any of the foregoing, now existing or
hereafter created, having jurisdiction over Owner, Tenant, this Lease or the
Real Property or any portion thereof.  Any work or installations made or
performed by or on behalf of Tenant or any person claiming through or under
Tenant pursuant to the provisions of this Article shall be made in conformity
with, and subject to the provisions of Article 3.  Compliance with any
requirement regarding asbestos or other hazardous material shall be made in
conformity with the provisions of Section 3.06.

          Section 6.02.  Tenant's Compliance with Owner's Fire Insurance:
                         -----------------------------------------------
Tenant shall not do anything, or permit anything to be done, in or about the
Demised Premises which shall (i) invalidate or be in conflict with the
provisions of any fire and/or other insurance policies covering the Building or
any property located therein, or (ii) result in a refusal by fire insurance
companies of good standing to insure the Building or any such property in
amounts reasonably satisfactory to Owner, or (iii) subject Owner to any
liability or responsibility for injury to any person or property by reason of
any business operation being conducted in the Demised Premises, or (iv) cause
any increase in the fire insurance rates applicable to the Building or property
located therein at the beginning of the Demised Term or at any time thereafter.
Tenant, at Tenant's expense, shall comply with all present and future rules,
orders, regulations and/or requirements of the New York Board of Fire
Underwriters and the New York Fire Insurance Rating Organization or any similar
body and the issuer of any insurance obtained by Owner covering the Building
and/or the Real Property, whether ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or
unforeseen, including, but not limited to, any requirement that hazardous
material installed in the Demised Premises by Tenant or any person claiming
through or under Tenant be removed or dealt with in any particular manner and
any requirement of New York City Local Law #5 of 1973, #16 of 1984, #58 of 1987
and the Americans With Disabilities Act or any successor laws of like import.

          Section 6.03.  Fire Insurance Rates:  In any action or proceeding
                         --------------------
wherein Owner and Tenant are parties, a schedule or "make up" of rates
applicable to the Building or property located therein issued by the New York
Fire Insurance Rating Organization, or other similar body fixing such fire
insurance rates, shall be conclusive evidence

                                       10

and of the several items and charges in the fire insurance rates then applicable
to the Building or property located therein.

                        SUBORDINATION, ATTORNMENT, ETC.
                        -------------------------------

          Section 7.01.  Lease Subordination:  This Lease and all rights of
                         -------------------
Tenant under this Lease are, and shall remain, unconditionally subject and
subordinate in all respects to all ground and underlying leases now or hereafter
in effect affecting the Real Property or any portion thereof, and to all
mortgages which may now or hereafter affect such leases or the Real Property,
and to all advances made or hereafter to be made under such mortgages, and to
all renewals, modifications, consolidations, correlations, replacements and
extensions of, and substitutions for, such leases and mortgages (such leases as
above described are referred to herein collectively as the "Superior Lease" and
                                                            --------------
such mortgages as above described are referred to herein collectively as the

"Mortgage").  The foregoing provisions of this Section shall be self-operative
 --------
and no further instrument of subordination shall be required.  In confirmation
of such subordination, Tenant shall execute and deliver promptly any certificate
or other instrument which Owner, or any lessor under any Superior Lease, or any
holder of any Mortgage may request, and Tenant hereby, after five (5) days
notice and Tenant's failure to so execute and deliver any such certificate or
other instrument, irrevocably constitutes and appoints Owner and all such
lessors and holders, acting jointly or severally, as Tenant's agent and
attorney-in-fact to execute any such certificate or other instrument for or on
behalf of Tenant.  If, in connection with obtaining financing with respect to
the Building, the Real Property, or the interest of the lessee under any
Superior Lease, any recognized lending institution shall request reasonable
modifications of this Lease as a condition of such financing, Tenant covenants
not unreasonably to withhold or delay its agreement to such modifications,
provided that such modifications do not materially increase the obligations, or
materially and adversely affect the rights, of Tenant under this Lease.  No act
or failure to act on the part of Owner which would entitle Tenant under the
terms of this Lease, or by law, to be relieved of Tenant's obligations hereunder
or to terminate this Lease shall result in a release or termination of such
obligations or a termination of this Lease unless (i) Tenant shall have first
given written notice of Owner's act or failure to act to the holder or holders
of any Mortgage and/or the lessor under any Superior Lease of whom Tenant has
been given written notice, specifying the act or failure to act on the part of
Owner which could or would give basis to Tenant's rights; and (ii) the holder or
holders of such Mortgage and/or the lessors under any Superior Lease, after
receipt of such notice, have failed or refused to correct or cure the condition
complained of within a reasonable time thereafter, but nothing contained in this
sentence shall be deemed to impose any obligation on any such holder or lessor
to correct or cure any such condition.  "Reasonable time" as used above means
                                         ---------------
and includes a reasonable time to obtain possession of the Building if any such
holder or lessor elects to do so (provided such holder or lessor institutes
proceedings to obtain possession within a reasonable time after notice from
Tenant pursuant to the foregoing provisions and conducts such proceedings with
reasonable diligence) and a reasonable time after so obtaining possession to
correct or cure the condition if such condition is determined to exist (provided
such holder or lessor commences said cure within ten (10) days after obtaining
possession and prosecutes the work required to cure with reasonable diligence).

          Section 7.02.  Tenant Attornment:  If, at any time prior to the
                         -----------------
expiration of the Demised Term, any Superior Lease under which Owner then shall
be the lessee shall terminate or be terminated for any reason, or the holder of
any Mortgage comes into possession of the Real Property or the Building or the
estate created by any Superior Lease by a receiver or otherwise, Tenant agrees,
at the election and upon demand of any owner of the Real Property, or of the
holder of any Mortgage so in possession, or of any lessee under any Superior
Lease covering the premises which include the Demised Premises, to attorn, from
time to time, to any such owner, holder, or lessee, upon the then executory
terms and conditions of this Lease, for the remainder of the term originally
demised in this Lease, provided that such owner, holder or lessee, as the case
may be, shall then be entitled to possession of the Demised Premises.  The
provisions of this Section shall enure to the benefit of any such owner, holder,
or lessee, shall apply notwithstanding that, as a matter of law, this Lease may
terminate upon the termination of any Superior Lease, shall be self-operative
upon any such demand, and no further instrument shall be required to give effect
to said provisions.  Tenant, however, upon demand of any such owner, holder, or
lessee, agrees to execute, from time to time, instruments in confirmation

                                       11
<PAGE>

of the foregoing provisions of this Section, satisfactory to any such owner,
holder, or lessee, acknowledging such attornment and setting forth the terms and
conditions of its tenancy. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed
to impair any right otherwise exercisable by any such owner, holder, or lessee.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Article no such
owner, holder or lessee shall be bound by (i) any payment of any instalment of
Fixed Rent or increases therein or any additional rent which may have been made
more than thirty (30) days before the due date of such instalment (except
prepayments in the nature of security for the performance of Tenant's
obligations under this Lease), or (ii) any amendment or modification to this
Lease which is made without its consent.

          Section 7.03.  Tenant Estoppel Certificate:  From time to time, within
                         ---------------------------
seven (7) days next following Owner's request, Tenant shall deliver to Owner a
written statement executed and acknowledged by Tenant, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Owner, (i) stating that this Lease is then in full
force and effect and has not been modified, if this is the case, (or if
modified, setting forth the specific nature of all modifications), and (ii)
setting forth the date to which the Fixed Rent has been paid, and (iii) stating
whether or not, to the best knowledge of Tenant, Owner is in default under this
Lease, and, if Owner is in default, setting forth the specific nature of all
such defaults and (iv) stating that Tenant has accepted and occupied the Demised
Premises and all improvements required to be made by Owner pursuant to the
provisions of this Lease, have been made, if such be the case.  Tenant
acknowledges that any statement delivered pursuant to this Section may be relied
upon by any purchaser or owner of the Building, or of the Real Property, or any
part thereof, or of Owner's interest in the Building or the Real Property or any
Superior Lease, or by the holder of any Mortgage, or by any assignee of the
holder of any Mortgage, or by any lessor under any Superior Lease.

          Section 7.04.  Owner Assignment of Lease and Rents:  If Owner assigns
                         -----------------------------------
its interest in this Lease, or the rents payable hereunder, to the holder of any
Mortgage or the lessor under any Superior Lease, whether the assignment shall be
conditional in nature or otherwise,  Tenant agrees that (a) the execution
thereof by Owner and the acceptance by such holder or lessor shall not be deemed
an assumption by such holder or lessor of any of the obligations of the Owner
under this Lease unless such holder or lessor shall, by written notice sent to
Tenant, specifically otherwise elect; and (b) except as aforesaid, such holder
or lessor shall be treated as having assumed Owner's obligations hereunder only
upon the foreclosure of such holder's Mortgage or the termination of such
lessor's Superior Lease and the taking of possession of the Demised Premises by
such holder or lessor, as the case may be.


                                   ARTICLE 8

                              PROPERTY LOSS, ETC.
                              -------------------

          Section 8.01.  Any Building employee to whom any property shall be
entrusted by or on behalf of Tenant shall be deemed to be acting as Tenant's
agent with respect to such property and neither Owner nor Owner's agents shall
be liable for any loss of or damage to any such property by theft or otherwise.
Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Lease, neither (i) the
performance by Owner, Tenant or others of any decorations, repairs, alterations,
additions or improvements in or to the Building or the Demised Premises, nor
(ii) the failure of Owner or others to make any such decorations, repairs,
alterations, additions or improvements, nor (iii) any damage to the Demised
Premises or to the property of Tenant, nor any injury to any persons, caused by
other tenants or persons in the Building, or by operations in the construction
of any private, public or quasi-public work, or by any other cause, nor (iv) any
latent defect in the Building or in the Demised Premises, nor (v) any temporary
(i.e., six [6] months or less) or permanent closing, darkening or bricking up of
any windows of the Demised Premises for any reason whatsoever beyond Owner's
reasonable control, nor any permanent closing, darkening or bricking up of any
such windows if required by law or in connection with any construction upon
adjacent property, nor (vi) any inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant or injury
to or interruption of Tenant's business by reason of any of the events or
occurrences referred to in the foregoing subdivisions (i) through (v), shall
constitute an actual or constructive eviction, in whole or in part, or entitle
Tenant to any abatement or diminution of rent, or relieve Tenant from any of its
obligations under this Lease, or impose any liability upon Owner, or its agents,
or any lessor under any Superior Lease, other than such liability as may be
imposed upon Owner by law for Owner's negligence or the negligence of Owner's
agents, servants or employees

                                       12
<PAGE>

in the operation or maintenance of the Building or for the breach by Owner of
any express covenant of this Lease on Owner's part to be performed. Tenant's
taking possession of the Demised Premises shall be conclusive evidence, as
against Tenant, that, at the time such possession was so taken, the Demised
Premises and the Building were in good and satisfactory condition.



                                   ARTICLE 9

                      DESTRUCTION-FIRE OR OTHER CASUALTY
                      ----------------------------------

          Section 9.01.  Owner's Repair Obligations:  If the Demised Premises or
                         --------------------------
Building shall be damaged by fire or other casualty, Tenant shall give prompt
notice to Owner of such damage, and Owner, at Owner's expense, shall thereafter
repair such damage.  However, Owner shall have no obligation to repair any
damage to, or to replace, Tenant's Personal Property or any other property or
effects of Tenant.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.03, if the entire
or a material portion of the Demised Premises shall be rendered untenantable or
if the Building is damaged to the extent that  reasonable access to the Demised
Premises is not available by reason of any such damage, the Fixed Rent shall
abate for the period from the date of such damage to the date when such damage
shall have been repaired, and if only a part of the Demised Premises shall be so
rendered untenantable, the Fixed Rent shall abate for such period in the
proportion which the area of the part of the Demised Premises so rendered
untenantable bears to the total area of the Demised Premises.  However, if,
prior to the date when all of such damage shall have been repaired, any part of
the Demised Premises so damaged shall be rendered tenantable and shall be used
or occupied by Tenant or any person or persons claiming through or under Tenant,
then the amount by which the Fixed Rent shall abate shall be equitably
apportioned for the period from the date of any such use or occupancy to the
date when all such damage shall have been repaired.  Tenant hereby expressly
waives the provisions of Section 227 of the New York Real Property Law, and of
any successor law of like import then in force, and Tenant agrees that the
provisions of this Article shall govern and control in lieu thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, prior to or during
the Demised Term, (i) the Demised Premises shall be totally damaged or rendered
wholly untenantable by fire or other casualty, and if Owner shall decide not to
restore the Demised Premises, or (ii) the Building shall be so damaged by fire
or other casualty that, in Owner's opinion, substantial alteration, demolition,
or reconstruction of the Building shall be required (whether or not the Demised
Premises shall have been damaged or rendered untenantable), then, in any of such
events, Owner, at Owner's option, may give to Tenant, within ninety (90) days
after such fire or other casualty, a five (5) days' notice of termination of
this Lease and, in the event such notice is given, this Lease and the Demised
Term shall come to an end and expire (whether or not said term shall have
commenced) upon the expiration of said five (5) days with the same effect as if
the date of expiration of said five (5) days were the Expiration Date, the Fixed
Rent shall be apportioned as of such date and any prepaid portion of Fixed Rent
for any period after such date shall be refunded by Owner to Tenant.

          Section 9.02.  Owner's Subrogation Waiver Provisions:  Owner now has
                         -------------------------------------
and shall continue to maintain so long as same is available using commercially
sound business practices, throughout the Demised Term, in Owner's fire insurance
and "all-risk" policies covering the Building, provisions to the effect that
such policies shall not be invalidated should the insured waive, in writing,
prior to a loss, any or all right of recovery against any party for loss
occurring to the Building.  In the event that at any time Owner's fire insurance
carriers shall exact an additional premium for the inclusion of such or similar
provisions, Owner shall give Tenant notice thereof.  In such event, if Tenant
agrees, in writing, to reimburse Owner for such additional premium for the
remainder of the Demised Term, Owner shall require the inclusion of such or
similar provisions by Owner's fire insurance carriers.  As long as such or
similar provisions are included in Owner's fire insurance and "all-risk"
policies then in force, or if substantially all fire insurance companies
licensed to do business in New York State (referred to as "New York State
                                                           --------------
Insurance Companies") include such provisions as a matter of course and Owner
- -------------------
fails to carry fire insurance containing such provisions, Owner hereby waives
(i) any obligation on the part of Tenant to make repairs to the Demised Premises
and the Building necessitated or occasioned by fire or other casualty that is an
insured risk under such policies, and (ii) any right of recovery or claim
against Tenant, any other permitted occupant of the Demised Premises, and any of
their servants, employees, agents or

                                       13
<PAGE>

contractors, for any loss occasioned by fire or other casualty which is an
insured risk under such policies and Owner shall look solely to such policies to
compensate Owner for any such loss. In the event that at any time Owner's fire
insurance carriers shall not include such or similar provisions in Owner's fire
insurance policies, and substantially all New York State Insurance Companies no
longer include such provisions as a matter of course, the waivers set forth in
the foregoing sentence shall, upon notice given by Owner to Tenant, be deemed of
no further force or effect and Owner shall have Tenant named in said policies as
an assured party, but not as a loss payee, provided that if at any time Owner's
fire insurance carriers shall exact an additional premium for naming Tenant as
an assured party, Tenant shall agree, in writing, to reimburse Owner for such
additional premium for the remainder of the Demised Term for so long as Tenant
shall elect to be an assured party. In the event Tenant shall be named in such
policies as an assured party in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this
Section, Tenant agrees to endorse promptly, without recourse, any check, draft
or order for the payment of money representing the proceeds of any such policies
or representing any other payment growing out of or in connection with any such
policies, and in the event Tenant does not promptly endorse such check, draft or
order, then Owner shall have the right as Tenant's attorney-in-fact, to make
such endorsement on behalf of Tenant, and Tenant does hereby irrevocably waive
any rights to participate in any settlement proceedings and further hereby
waives any and all rights in and to any such proceeds and payments.

          Section 9.03.  Tenant Negligence:  Except to the extent expressly
                         -----------------
provided in Section 9.02, nothing contained in this Lease shall relieve Tenant
of any liability to Owner or to its insurance carriers which Tenant may have
under law or the provisions of this Lease in connection with any damage to the
Demised Premises or the Building caused by fire or other casualty.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.01, if any such damage, occurring
after any date when the waivers set forth in Section 9.02 are no longer in force
and effect, is due to the fault or neglect of Tenant, any person claiming
through or under Tenant, or any of their servants, employees, agents,
contractors, visitors or licensees, then there shall be no abatement of Fixed
Rent by reason of such damage.

          Section 9.04.  Tenant Subrogation Waiver Provisions:  Tenant
                         ------------------------------------
acknowledges that it has been advised that Owner's insurance policies do not
cover Tenant's Personal Property or any other property of Tenant in the Demised
Premises; accordingly, it shall be Tenant's obligation to obtain and maintain
insurance covering its property in the Demised Premises and loss of profits
including, but not limited to, water damage coverage and business interruption
insurance.  Tenant shall attempt to obtain and maintain, throughout the Demised
Term, in Tenant's fire and other insurance policies covering Tenant's Personal
Property and other property of Tenant in the Demised Premises, and Tenant's use
and occupancy of the Demised Premises, and/or Tenant's profits (and shall cause
any other permitted occupants of the Demised Premises to attempt to obtain and
maintain, in similar policies), provisions to the effect that such policies
shall not be invalidated should the insured waive, in writing, prior to a loss,
any or all right of recovery against any party for loss occasioned by fire or
other casualty which is an insured risk under such policies.  In the event that
at any time the fire insurance carriers issuing such policies shall exact an
additional premium for the inclusion of such or similar provisions, Tenant shall
give Owner notice thereof.  In such event, if Owner agrees, in writing, to
reimburse Tenant or any person claiming through or under Tenant, as the case may
be, for such additional premium for the remainder of the Demised Term, Tenant
shall require the inclusion of such or similar provisions by such insurance
carriers.  As long as such or similar provisions are included in such insurance
policies then in force, Tenant hereby waives (and agrees to cause any other
permitted occupants of the Demised Premises to execute and deliver to Owner
written instruments waiving) any right of recovery against Owner, any lessors
under any Superior Leases, the holders of any Mortgage, and all other tenants or
occupants of the Building, and any servants, employees, agents or contractors of
Owner, or of any such lessor, or holder or any such other tenants or occupants,
for any loss occasioned by fire or other casualty which is an insured risk under
such policies.  In the event that at any time such insurance carriers shall not
include such or similar provisions in any such insurance policy, the waiver set
forth in the foregoing sentence (or in any written instrument executed by any
other permitted occupant of the Demised Premises) shall, upon notice given by
Tenant to Owner, be deemed of no further force or effect with respect to any
insured risks under such policy from and after the giving of such notice. During
any period while any such waiver of right of recovery is in effect, Tenant, or
any other permitted occupant of the Demised Premises, as the case may be, shall
look solely to the proceeds of such policies to compensate Tenant or such other

          Section 10.01. Taking of the Demised Premises:  If the whole or any
                         ------------------------------
material and substantial portion of the Demised Premises shall be acquired for
any public or quasi-public use or purpose, whether by condemnation or by deed in
lieu of condemnation, this Lease and the Demised Term shall end as of the date
of the vesting of title with the same effect as if said date were the Expiration
Date.  If only a part of the Demised Premises shall be so acquired or condemned
then, except as otherwise provided in this Section, this Lease and the Demised
Term shall continue in force and effect but, from and after the date of the
vesting of title, the Fixed Rent shall be reduced in the proportion which the
area of the part of the Demised Premises so acquired or condemned bears to the
total area of the Demised Premises immediately prior to such acquisition or
condemnation.  If only a part of the Real Property shall be so acquired or
condemned, then (i) whether or not the Demised Premises shall be affected
thereby, Owner, at Owner's option, may give to Tenant, within sixty (60) days
next following the date upon which Owner shall have received notice of vesting
of title, a five (5) days' notice of termination of this Lease, and (ii) if the
part of the Real Property so acquired or condemned shall contain more than ten
(10%) percent of the total area of the Demised Premises immediately prior to
such acquisition or condemnation, or if, by reason of such acquisition or
condemnation, Tenant no longer has reasonable means of access to the Demised
Premises, Tenant, at Tenant's option, may give to Owner, within sixty (60) days
next following the date upon which Tenant shall have received notice of vesting
of title, a five (5) days' notice of termination of this Lease.  In the event
any such five (5) days' notice of termination is given, by Owner or Tenant, this
Lease and the Demised Term shall come to an end and expire upon the expiration
of said five (5) days with the same effect as if the date of expiration of said
five (5) days were the Expiration Date.  If a part of the Demised Premises shall
be so acquired or condemned and this Lease and the Demised Term shall not be
terminated pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section, Owner, at
Owner's expense, shall restore that part of the Demised Premises not so acquired
or condemned to a self-contained rental unit.  In the event of any termination
of this Lease and the Demised Term pursuant to the provisions of this Section,
the Fixed Rent shall be apportioned as of the date of such termination and any
prepaid portion of Fixed Rent for any period after such date shall be refunded
by Owner to Tenant.

          Section 10.02. Condemnation Award or Claims:  In the event of any such
                         ----------------------------
acquisition or condemnation of all or any part of the Real Property, Owner shall
be entitled to receive the entire award for any such acquisition or
condemnation, Tenant shall have no claim against Owner or the condemning
authority for the value of any unexpired portion of the Demised Term and Tenant
hereby expressly assigns to Owner all of its right in and to any such award.
Nothing contained in this Section shall be deemed to prevent Tenant from making
a claim in any condemnation proceedings for the value of any items of Tenant's
Personal Property which are compensable, in law, as trade fixtures, or provided
that such claim is authorized by law and will not in any way diminish the award
to which Owner would be entitled if no such claim were made, for Tenant's moving
and/or re-location expenses.

                           ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING
                           -------------------------

          Section 11.01. General Covenant:  Except as expressly set forth in
                         ----------------
this Article 11, Tenant, for itself, its heirs, distributees, executors,
administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns, covenants that,
without the prior consent of Owner in each instance, it shall not (i) assign
whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, mortgage or encumber its interest
in this Lease, in whole or in part, or (ii) sublet, or permit the subletting of,
the Demised Premises or any part thereof, or (iii) permit the Demised Premises
or any part thereof to be occupied, or used for desk space, mailing privileges
or otherwise, by any person other than Tenant. The sale, pledge, transfer or
other alienation of (a) a controlling interest in the issued and outstanding
capital stock of any corporate Tenant (unless such stock is publicly traded on a
recognized security exchange or over-the counter market) or (b) a controlling
interest in any partnership, limited liability company or joint venture or other
business entity comprising Tenant, however accomplished, and whether in a single
transaction or in a series of related and/or unrelated transactions, shall be
deemed for the purposes of this Section as an assignment of this Lease which
shall require the prior consent of Owner in each instance.  For the purposes of
this Section and Section 11.03, the word "controlling" shall have the same
meaning as the word "control" set forth in Section 11.05.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, a public offering of the stock
of Tenant named herein on a recognized security exchange or over-the-counter
market shall not be considered an assignment of this Lease requiring the prior
approval of Owner.

          Section 11.02. Owner's Rights Upon Assignment: If Tenant's interest
                         ------------------------------
in this Lease is assigned, whether or not in violation of the provisions of this
Article, Owner may collect rent from the assignee; if the Demised Premises or
any part thereof are sublet to, or occupied by, or used by, any person other
than Tenant, whether or not in violation of this Article, Owner, after default
by Tenant under this Lease, may collect rent from the subtenant, user or
occupant.  In either case, Owner shall apply the net amount collected to the
rents reserved in this Lease, but neither any such assignment, subletting,
occupancy, or use, whether with or without Owner's prior consent, nor any such
collection or application, shall be deemed a waiver of any term, covenant or
condition of this Lease or the acceptance by Owner of such assignee, subtenant,
occupant or user as tenant.  The consent by Owner to any assignment, subletting,
occupancy or use shall not relieve Tenant from its obligation to obtain the
express prior consent of Owner to any further assignment, subletting, occupancy
or use.  If this Lease is assigned to any person or entity pursuant to any
proceeding of the type referred to in Subsections 16.01(c) and 16.01(d), any and
all monies or other consideration payable or otherwise to be delivered in
connection with such assignment shall be paid or delivered to Owner, shall be
and remain the exclusive property of Owner and shall not constitute property of
Tenant or of the estate of Tenant within the meaning of any proceeding of the
type referred to in Subsections 16.01(c) and 16.01(d). Any and all monies or
other considerations constituting Owner's property under the preceding sentence
not paid or delivered to Owner shall be held in trust for the benefit of Owner
and shall be promptly paid to or turned over to Owner. Any person or entity to
which this Lease is assigned pursuant to any proceeding of the type referred to
in Subsections 16.01(c) and 16.01(d) shall be deemed without further act or deed
to have assumed all of the obligations arising under this Lease on and after the
date of such assignment.  Any such assignee shall execute and deliver to Owner
upon demand an instrument confirming such assumption.   The listing of any name
other than that of Tenant on any door of the Demised Premises or on any
directory or in any elevator in the Building, or otherwise, shall not operate to
vest in the person so named any right or interest in this Lease or in the
Demised Premises, or the Building, or be deemed to constitute, or serve as a
substitute for, any prior consent of Owner required under this Article, and it
is understood that any such listing shall constitute a privilege extended by
Owner which shall be revocable at Owner's will by notice to Tenant.  Tenant
agrees to pay to Owner reasonable counsel fees not to exceed THREE THOUSAND and
00/100 ($3,000.00) DOLLARS in any single instance incurred by Owner in
connection with any proposed assignment of Tenant's interest in this Lease or
any proposed subletting of the Demised Premises or any part thereof.  Neither
any assignment of Tenant's interest in this Lease nor any subletting, occupancy
or use of the Demised Premises or any part thereof by any person other than
Tenant, nor any collection of rent by Owner from any person other than Tenant as
provided in this Section, nor any application of any such rent as provided in
this Section shall, in any circumstances, relieve Tenant of its obligation fully
to observe and perform the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease on
Tenant's part to be observed or performed.

          Section 11.03. Sublet Rights:  A. (1) As long as Tenant is not in
                         -------------
default under any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease on
Tenant's part to be observed or performed, Owner agrees not to unreasonably
withhold Owner's prior consent to a subletting by Tenant of all or a portion of
the Demised Premises to one (1) subtenant for undivided occupancy by such
subtenant, for the use expressly permitted in this Lease.

                    (2)  Without Owner's prior consent, Tenant shall not (a)
negotiate or enter into a proposed subletting with any tenant, subtenant or
occupant of any space in the Building or (b) list or otherwise publicly
advertise the Demised Premises or any part thereof for subletting at a rental
lower than the rental at which the Owner is then offering to rent comparable
space in the Building.

                    (3)  At least thirty (30) days prior to any proposed
subletting, Tenant shall submit to Owner a statement (the "Proposed Sublet
                                                           ---------------
Statement") containing the name and address of the proposed subtenant, the
- ---------
nature of the proposed subtenant's business and its current financial status, if
such status is obtained by Tenant, and all of the principal terms and conditions
of the proposed subletting including, but not limited to, the proposed
commencement and expiration dates of the term thereof.

                    (4)  Owner may withhold consent to a proposed subletting if,
(a) in Owner's reasonable judgment, the occupancy of the proposed subtenant will
tend to impair the character or dignity of the Building or impose any additional
burden upon Owner in the operation of the Building, or (b) in Owner's reasonable
judgment, the occupancy of the proposed subtenant will tend to impair the
reputation of (i) the Building as an information technology center or (ii) the
floor on which the Demised Premises are located as a floor devoted to
information technology tenants or (c) the proposed subtenant shall be a person
or entity with whom Owner is then negotiating or discussing to lease space in
the Building or (d) if Owner shall have any other reasonable objections to such
subletting.

                    (5)  In the event of any dispute between Owner and Tenant as
to the reasonableness of Owner's failure or refusal to consent to any
subletting, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with
the provisions of Article 36.

                    (6)  Tenant shall reimburse Owner on demand for any
reasonable costs or expense that may be incurred by Owner's review of any
Proposed Sublet Statement or in connection with any sublease consented to by
Owner, including, without limitation, any reasonable processing fee, reasonable
attorneys' fees and disbursements and the reasonable costs of making
investigations as to the acceptability of the proposed subtenant.

               B.   Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
11.03, Owner shall have the following rights with respect to each proposed
subletting by Tenant:

                    (1)  in the event Tenant proposes to sublet the Demised
Premises, whether or not such subletting is for all or substantially all of the
remainder of the Demised Term, Owner, at Owner's option, may give to Tenant,
within thirty (30) days after the submission by Tenant to Owner of the Proposed
Sublet Statement, a notice terminating this Lease on the date (referred to as
the "Earlier Termination Date") immediately prior to the proposed commencement
     ------------------------
date of the term of the proposed subletting, as set forth in the Proposed Sublet
Statement, and, in the event such notice is given, this Lease and the Demised
Term shall come to an end and expire on the Earlier Termination Date with the
same effect as if it were the Expiration Date, the Fixed Rent shall be
apportioned as of said Earlier Termination Date and any prepaid portion of Fixed
Rent for any period after such date shall be refunded by Owner to Tenant; or

                    (2)  In the event Tenant proposes to sublet the Demised
Premises for less than substantially all of the remainder of the Demised Term,
Owner, at Owner's option, may give to Tenant, within thirty (30) days after the
submission by Tenant to Owner, of the Proposed Sublet Statement required to be
submitted in connection with such proposed subletting, a notice electing to
recapture the Demised Premises during the period (referred to as the "Recapture
                                                                      ---------
Period") commencing on the date (referred to as "Recapture Date") immediately

prior to

<PAGE>

the proposed commencement date of the term of the proposed subletting, as set
forth in the Proposed Sublet Statement, and ending on the proposed expiration
date of the term of the proposed subletting, as set forth in the Proposed Sublet
Statement, and in the event such notice is given the following shall apply:

               (a)  The Demised Premises shall be recaptured by Owner during the
               Recapture Period;

               (b)  Tenant shall surrender the Demised Premises to Owner on or
               prior to the Recapture Date in the same manner as if said Date
               were the Expiration Date;

               (c)  During the Recapture Period Tenant shall have no rights with
               respect to the Demised Premises nor any obligations with respect
               to the Demised Premises, including, but not limited to, any
               obligations to pay Fixed Rent or any increases therein or any
               additional rent, and any prepaid portion of Fixed Rent allocable
               to the Recapture Period shall be refunded by Owner to Tenant;

               (d)  There shall be an equitable apportionment of any increase in
               the Fixed Rent pursuant to Article 23 for the Escalation Year and
               Tax Escalation Year (as defined in Article 23) in which said
               Recapture Date shall occur;

               (e)  Upon the expiration of the Recapture Period, the Demised
               Premises, in its then existing condition, shall be deemed
               restored to Tenant and Tenant shall have all rights with respect
               to the Demised Premises which are set forth in this Lease and all
               obligations with respect to the Demised Premises which are set
               forth in this Lease, including, but not limited to, the
               obligations for the payment of Fixed Rent and any increases
               therein and any additional rent (as they would have been adjusted
               if Tenant occupied the Demised Premises during the Recapture
               Period) during the period (referred to as the "Recapture
                                                              ---------
               Restoration Period") commencing on the date next following the
               ------------------
               expiration of the Recapture Period and ending on the Expiration
               Date, except in the event that Owner is unable to give Tenant
               possession of the Demised Premises at the expiration of the
               Recapture Period by reason of the holding over or retention of
               possession of any tenant or other occupant, in which event (x)
               the Recapture Restoration Period shall not commence and the
               Demised Premises shall not be deemed available for Tenant's
               occupancy and Tenant shall not be required to comply with the
               obligations of Tenant under this Lease until the date upon which
               Owner shall give Tenant possession of the Demised Premises free
               of occupancies, (y) neither the Expiration Date nor the validity
               of this Lease nor the obligations of Tenant under this Lease
               shall be affected thereby, and (z) Tenant waives any rights to
               rescind this Lease and to recover any damages which may result
               from the failure by Owner to deliver possession of the Demised
               Premises at the end of the Recapture Period; Owner agrees to
               institute, within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the
               Recapture Period, possession proceedings against any tenants and
               occupants who have not so vacated and surrendered all or any
               portions of the Demised Premises and agrees to prosecute such
               proceedings with reasonable diligence; and

               (f)  There shall be an equitable apportionment of any increase in
               the Fixed Rent pursuant to Article 23 for the Escalation Year and
               Tax Escalation Year in which the Recapture Restoration Period
               shall commence.

At the request of Owner, Tenant shall execute and deliver an instrument or
instruments, in form satisfactory to Owner, setting forth any modifications to
this Lease contemplated in or resulting from the operation of the foregoing
provisions of this Subsection 11.03; however, neither Owner's failure to request
any such instrument nor Tenant's failure to execute or deliver any such
instrument shall vitiate the effect of the foregoing provisions of this Section.
The failure by Owner to exercise any option under this Section 11.03 with
respect to any subletting shall not be deemed a waiver of such option with
respect to any extension of such subletting or any subsequent subletting of the
premises affected thereby

                                       18
<PAGE>

or any other portion of the Demised Premises. Tenant shall indemnify Owner from
all loss, cost, liability, damage and expense, including, but not limited to,
reasonable counsel fees and disbursements, arising from any claims against Owner
by any broker or other person, for a brokerage commission or other similar
compensation in connection with any such proposed subletting, in the event (a)
Owner shall (i) fail or refuse to consent to any proposed subletting, or (ii)
exercise any of its options under this Section 11.03, or (b) any proposed
subletting shall fail to be consummated for any reason whatsoever.

                    C.   Tenant agrees that (1) seventy-five (75%) percent of
any increase in the rental value of the Demised Premises over and above the
Fixed Rent payable pursuant to the provisions of this Lease, as such Fixed Rent
may be increased from time to time pursuant to the provisions of this Lease, and
(2) any consideration paid to Tenant or any subtenant or other person claiming
through or under Tenant in connection with an assignment of Tenant's interest in
this Lease or the interest of any subtenant or other person claiming through or
under Tenant under any sublease whether or not such assignment shall be effected
with court approval in a proceeding of the types described in Subsection
16.01(c) or (d), or in any similar proceeding, or otherwise, shall accrue to the
benefit of Owner and not to the benefit of Tenant, or of any subtenant or other
person claiming through or under Tenant, or of the creditors of Tenant or of any
such subtenant or other person claiming through or under Tenant. Accordingly,
Tenant agrees that if Owner shall fail to exercise its option to sooner
terminate this Lease or its option to recapture the Demised Premises in
connection with any proposed subletting by Tenant, or if any subtenant or other
person claiming through or under Tenant shall sublet all or any portion of the
Demised Premises, Tenant shall pay to Owner a sum equal to seventy-five (75%)
percent of any Subletting Profit, as such term is hereinafter defined. All
rentals and other sums (including, but not limited to, sums payable for the sale
or rental of any fixtures, leasehold improvements, equipment, furniture or other
personal property, less, in the case of the sale thereof, the then net
unamortized [on a straight-line basis over the term of this Lease or, in the
event of a further subletting, over the term of the initial sublease, as the
case may be] cost thereof, which were provided and installed in the sublet
premises at the sole cost and expense of Tenant or such subtenant or other
person claiming through or under Tenant and for which no allowance or other
credit has been given by Owner) payable by any subtenant to Tenant or to any
subtenant or other person claiming through or under Tenant in connection with
any subletting in excess of the Fixed Rent then payable by Tenant to Owner under
this Lease are referred to, in the aggregate, as "Subletting Profit"; in
                                                  -----------------
computing any Subletting Profit it shall be deemed that the rental reserved
under any such subletting shall commence to accrue as of the commencement of the
term of such subletting even if such rental actually commences to accrue as of a
date subsequent to such commencement and there shall be first deducted
reasonable alteration expenses and reasonable legal fees with respect to such
subletting and a reasonable single brokerage commission, if any such commission
shall be paid by Tenant or any such subtenant or other person claiming through
or under Tenant in connection with such subletting. Owner and Tenant agree that
if Tenant, or any subtenant or other person claiming through or under Tenant,
shall assign or have assigned its interest as Tenant under this Lease or its
interest as subtenant under any sublease as the case may be, whether or not such
assignment shall be effected with court approval in a proceeding of the types
described in Subsections 16.01(c) or (d), or in any similar proceeding, or
otherwise, Tenant shall pay to Owner a sum equal to any consideration paid to
Tenant or any subtenant or other person claiming through or under Tenant for
such assignment. All sums payable hereunder to Tenant shall be paid to Owner as
additional rent immediately upon such sums becoming payable to Tenant or to any
subtenant or other person claiming through or under Tenant and, if requested by
Owner, Tenant shall promptly enter into a written agreement with Owner setting
forth the amount of such sums to be paid to Owner, however, neither Owner's
failure to request the execution of such agreement nor Tenant's failure to
execute such agreement shall vitiate the provisions of this Section. For the
purposes of this Section, a trustee, receiver or other representative of the
Tenant's or any subtenant's estate under any federal or state bankruptcy act
shall be deemed a person claiming through or under Tenant.

                    D.   Neither Owner's consent to any subletting nor anything
contained in this Section shall be deemed to grant to any subtenant or other
person claiming through or under Tenant the right to sublet all or any portion
of the Demised Premises or to permit the occupancy of all or any portion of the
Demised Premises by others. Neither any subtenant referred to in this Section
nor its heirs, distributees, executors, administrators, legal representatives,
successors nor assigns, without the prior consent of Owner in each instance,
shall (i) assign, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, mortgage or
encumber its interest in any sublease, in whole or in part, or (ii) sublet, or
permit the subletting of, that part of the Demised Premises affected by such
subletting or any portion thereof,

                                       19
<PAGE>

or (iii) permit such part of the Demised Premises affected by such subletting or
any part thereof to be occupied or used for desk space, mailing privileges or
otherwise, by any person other than such subtenant and any sublease shall
provide that any violation of the foregoing provisions of this sentence shall be
an event of default thereunder. The sale, pledge, transfer or other alienation
of (a) a controlling interest in the issued and outstanding capital stock of any
corporate subtenant (unless such stock is publicly traded on any recognized
security exchange or over-the-counter market) or (b) a controlling interest in
any partnership or joint venture subtenant, however accomplished, and whether in
a single transaction or in a series of related or unrelated transactions, shall
be deemed for the purposes of this Section to be an assignment of such sublease
which shall require the prior consent of Owner in each instance and any sublease
shall so provide.

          Section 11.04. Owner's Rights Upon Lease Disaffirmance:  A. In the
                         ---------------------------------------
event that, at any time after Tenant may have assigned Tenant's interest in this
Lease, this Lease shall be disaffirmed or rejected in any proceeding of the
types described in Subsections 16.01(c) and (d), or in any similar proceeding,
or in the event of termination of this Lease by reason of any such proceeding or
by reason of lapse of time following notice of termination given pursuant to
Section 16.01 based upon any of the Events of Default set forth in said
Subsections, Tenant, upon request of Owner given within thirty (30) days next
following any such disaffirmance, rejection or termination (and actual notice
thereof to Owner in the event of a disaffirmance or rejection or in the event of
termination other than by act of Owner), shall (i) pay to Owner all Fixed Rent,
additional rent and other charges due and owing by the assignee to Owner under
this Lease to and including the date of such disaffirmance, rejection or
termination, and (ii) as "tenant", enter into a new lease with Owner of the
Demised Premises for a term commencing on the effective date of such
disaffirmance, rejection or termination and ending on the Expiration Date unless
sooner terminated as in such lease provided, at the same Fixed Rent and then
executory terms, covenants and conditions as are contained in this Lease, except
that (a) Tenant's rights under the new lease shall be subject to the possessory
rights of the assignee under this Lease and the possessory rights of any person
claiming through or under such assignee or by virtue of any statute or of any
order of any court, and (b) such new lease shall require all defaults existing
under this Lease to be cured by Tenant with due diligence, and (c) such new
lease shall require Tenant to pay all increases in the Fixed Rent reserved in
this Lease which, had this Lease not been so disaffirmed, rejected or
terminated, would have accrued under the provisions of Article 23 of this Lease
after the date of such disaffirmance, rejection or termination with respect to
any period prior thereto.  In the event Tenant shall default in its obligation
to enter into said new lease for a period of ten (10) days next following
Owner's request therefor, then, in addition to all other rights and remedies by
reason of such default, either at law or in equity, Owner shall have the same
rights and remedies against Tenant as if Tenant had entered into such new lease
and such new lease had thereafter been terminated as at the commencement date
thereof by reason of Tenant's default thereunder.  Nothing contained in this
Section shall be deemed to grant to Tenant any right to assign Tenant's interest
in this Lease.

          Section 11.05. Subsidiary/Affiliate:  A. As long as Tenant is not in
                         --------------------
default under any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease on
Tenant's part to be observed and performed, Tenant named herein shall have the
right, without the prior consent of Owner, to assign its interest in this Lease,
for the use permitted in this Lease, to any subsidiary or affiliate of Tenant
named herein, which is in the same general line of business as Tenant named
herein and only for such period as it shall remain such subsidiary or affiliate.
For the purposes of this Article: (a) a "subsidiary" of Tenant named herein
shall mean any corporation not less than fifty-one (51%) percent of whose
outstanding voting stock at the time shall be owned or controlled by Tenant
named herein, and (b) an "affiliate" of Tenant named herein shall mean Tenant's
parent and any corporation, partnership or other business entity which controls
or is controlled by, or is under common control with Tenant.  For the purpose of
the definition of "affiliate" the word "control" (including, "controlled by" and
"under common control with") as used with respect to any corporation,
partnership or other business entity, shall mean the possession of the power to
direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such
corporation, partnership or other business entity, whether through the ownership
of voting securities or contract.  No such assignment shall be valid or
effective unless, within ten (10) days after the execution thereof, Tenant shall
deliver to Owner all of the following: (I) a duplicate original instrument of
assignment, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Owner and Tenant,
duly executed by Tenant, in  which Tenant shall (a) waive all notices of default
given to the assignee, and all other notices of every kind or description now or
hereafter provided in this Lease, by statute or rule of law, and (b) acknowledge
that Tenant's obligations with respect to this Lease

                                       20
<PAGE>

shall not be discharged, released or impaired by (i) such assignment, (ii) any
amendment or modification of this Lease, whether or not the obligations of
Tenant are increased thereby, (iii) any further assignment or transfer of
Tenant's interest in this Lease, (iv) any exercise, non-exercise or waiver by
Owner of any right, remedy, power or privilege under or with respect to this
Lease, (v) any waiver, consent, extension, indulgence or other act or omission
with respect to any other obligations of Tenant under this Lease, (vi) any act
or thing which, but for the provisions of such assignment, might be deemed a
legal or equitable discharge of a surety or assignor, to all of which Tenant
shall consent in advance, it being the purpose and intent of Owner and Tenant
that the obligations of Tenant hereunder as assignor shall be absolute and
unconditional under any and all circumstances, and (II) an instrument, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Owner and such assignee, duly executed
by the assignee, in which such assignee shall assume the observance and
performance of, and agree to be bound by, all of the terms, covenants and
conditions of this Lease on Tenant's part to be observed and performed.

                  B.     As long as Tenant is not in default under any of the
terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease on Tenant's part to be observed and
performed, Tenant named herein shall have the right without the prior consent of
Owner, to sublet to, or permit the use or occupancy of, all or any part of the
Demised Premises by any subsidiary or affiliate (as said terms are defined in
Section 11.05A.) of Tenant named herein for the use permitted in this Lease
provided that such subsidiary or affiliate is in the same general line of
business as the Tenant named herein and only for such period as it shall remain
such subsidiary or affiliate and in the same general line of business as the
Tenant named herein. However, no such subletting shall be valid unless, prior to
the execution thereof, Tenant shall give notice to Owner of the proposed
subletting, and within ten (10) days prior to the commencement of said
subletting, Tenant shall deliver to Owner an agreement, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Owner and Tenant, duly executed by Tenant and said
subtenant, in which said subtenant shall assume performance of and agree to be
bound by, all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease which are
applicable to said subtenant and such subletting. Tenant shall give prompt
notice to Owner of any such use or occupancy of all or any part of the Demised
Premises and such use or occupancy shall be subject and subordinate to all of
the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease. No such use or occupancy
shall operate to vest in the user or occupant any right or interest in this
Lease or the Demised Premises. For the purposes of determining the number of
subtenants or occupants in the Demised Premises, the occupancy of any such
permitted subsidiary or affiliate of Tenant shall be deemed the occupancy of
Tenant and such subsidiary or affiliate shall not be counted as a subtenant or
occupant for the purposes of Section 11.03 and the provisions of Section 11.03
relating to Owner's option to terminate this Lease and recapture any portions of
the Demised Premises and the provisions of Section 11.03 relating to Subletting
Profits shall not be applicable to any proposed subletting to any such
subsidiary or affiliate of Tenant pursuant to the provisions of this Section.

          Section 11.06.  Merger/Consolidation:  As long as Tenant is not then
                          --------------------
in default under any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease on
Tenant's part to be observed or performed, Owner's consent shall not be required
for an assignment of Tenant's interest in this Lease to any person, corporation,
partnership, or other business entity which is a successor of Tenant, either by
merger or consolidation or the purchase of all or substantially all of the
stock, assets, business and goodwill of Tenant named herein, provided that said
person, corporation, partnership or other business entity shall have a net
worth, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied, at least equal to that of Tenant named herein as of the
date of this Lease, and provided further that such successor, person,
corporation, partnership or other business entity shall continue to operate
Tenant's present business in the Demised Premises and the interest of Tenant
named herein in this Lease is not the sole or principal asset of Tenant named
herein and such assignment is made for a good business purpose.  At or about the
time of said proposed assignment, Tenant shall deliver to Owner a reasonably
detailed statement of the financial condition of the aforesaid proposed
assignee, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
applied on a consistent basis, sworn to by an executive officer or principal or
partner of Tenant and the proposed Assignee, or certified without qualification
by a firm of reputable independent certified public accountants which statement
shall reflect the financial condition of the aforesaid proposed assignee at that
time.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section to the contrary, such
assignment shall not be valid if the aforesaid proposed assignee shall not have
a net worth at least equal to that of Tenant as of the date of this Lease or the
interest of Tenant named herein in this Lease is the sole or principal asset of
Tenant named herein or such assignment is not made for a good business purpose.
In the event of any dispute between Owner and Tenant as to the validity of any
such assignment such dispute shall be determined by arbitration

                                       21
<PAGE>

in the City of New York in accordance with the provisions of Section 36.01. Any
such determination shall be final and binding upon the parties whether or not a
judgment shall be entered in any court. If the determination of any such
arbitration shall be adverse to Owner, Owner, nevertheless, shall not be liable
to Tenant and Tenant's sole remedy in such event shall be to have the proposed
assignment deemed valid. Other than with respect to any instance where Tenant
named herein, Bottomline Technologies, Inc., is merged into another entity, no
such assignment shall be valid, unless, within ten (10) days after the execution
thereof, Tenant shall deliver to Owner (I) a duplicate original instrument of
assignment in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Owner duly executed
by Tenant, acknowledged before a notary public, in customary and reasonable form
and substance in which Tenant shall (a) waive all notices of default given to
the assignee and all other notices of every kind or description, now or
hereafter provided in this Lease, by statute or by rule of law; (b) acknowledge
that Tenant's obligations with respect to this Lease shall not be discharged,
released or impaired by (i) such assignment; (ii) any amendment or modification
of this Lease (whether or not the obligations of Tenant are increased thereby);
(iii) any further assignment or transfer of Tenant's interest in this Lease;
(iv) any exercise, non- exercise or waiver by Owner of any right, remedy, power
or privilege under or with respect to this Lease; (v) any waiver, consent,
extension, indulgence or other act or omission with respect to any of the
obligations of Tenant under this Lease; (vi) any act or thing which, but for the
provisions of such assignment, might be deemed a legal or equitable discharge of
a surety or assignor, to all of which Tenant shall consent in advance; it being
the purpose and intent of Owner and Tenant that the obligations of Tenant
hereunder as assignor shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances; and (II) an instrument in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Owner, duly executed by the proposed assignee, acknowledged
before a notary public, in which such proposed assignee shall assume observance
and performance of, and agree to be bound by, all of the terms, covenants and
conditions of this Lease on Tenant's part to be performed.

any of the purposes set forth in this Article or for the purpose of performing
any obligation of Owner under this Lease or exercising any right or remedy
reserved to Owner in this Lease, or complying with any Legal Requirement which
Owner is obligated to comply with hereunder, and if Tenant, its officers,

be necessary or permissible, to use a master key or to forcibly enter the
Demised Premises; (ii) to erect, install, use and maintain pipes, ducts and

Owner also reserves the right at any time to change the arrangement or location
of entrances, passageways, doors, doorways, corridors, elevators, stairs,
toilets and other public parts of the Building, provided any such change does
not permanently and unreasonably obstruct Tenant's access to or use of the

the Demised Premises or the Building.

                          ----------------------------------
Owner or its agents or by the lessor under any Superior Lease or by the holder

of Tenant's business, or otherwise.

          Section 13.05.  Supplementing the provisions of Sections 13.01, 13.02
and 13.03, Owner agrees that except in cases of emergency, any entry upon the

provisions of Article 27), and any work performed or installation made pursuant
to said Section shall be made with reasonable diligence and any such entry, work
or installations shall be made in a manner designed to minimize interference

Section shall be deemed to impose upon Owner any obligation to employ
contractors or labor at so-called overtime or other premium pay rates).

          Section 13.06.  Further supplementing the provisions of Sections 13.01
and 13.03, Owner's right to exhibit the Demised Premises to others shall be

          Section 14.01.  The Demised Premises do not contain any vaults, vault
space or other space outside the boundaries of the Real Property,
notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease or indicated on any sketch,
blueprint or plan.  Owner makes no representation as to the location of the
boundaries of the Real Property.  All vaults and vault space and all other space
outside the boundaries of the Real Property which Tenant may be permitted to use
or occupy are to be used or occupied under a revocable license, and if any such
license shall be revoked, or if the amount of such space shall be diminished or
required by any Federal, State or Municipal Authority or by any public utility
company, such revocation, diminution or requisition shall not constitute an
actual or constructive eviction, in whole or in part, or entitle Tenant to any
abatement or diminution of rent, or relieve Tenant from any of its obligations
under this Lease, or impose any liability upon Owner.  Any fee, tax or charge
imposed by any governmental authority for any such vault, vault space or other
space shall be paid by Tenant.

of Occupancy covering the Demised Premises.  Owner agrees that a temporary or
permanent Certificate(s) of Occupancy covering the Demised Premises will be in
force on the Commencement Date permitting the Demised Premises to be used as
"offices".  However, neither such agreement, nor any other provision of this
Lease, nor any act or omission of Owner, its agents or contractors, shall be
deemed to constitute a representation or warranty that the Demised Premises, or
any part thereof, may be lawfully used or occupied for any particular purpose or
in any particular manner, in contradistinction to mere "office" use.

                  (a)     Owner and its agents and servants may immediately, or
          at any time after such default or after the date upon which this Lease
          and the Demised Term shall expire and come to an end, re-enter the
          Demised Premises or any part thereof, without notice, either by
          summary proceedings or by any other applicable action or proceeding,
          or by force or otherwise (without being liable to indictment,
          prosecution or damages therefor), and may repossess the Demised
          Premises and dispossess Tenant and any other persons from the Demised
          Premises and remove any and all of their property and effects from the
          Demised Premises; and

                  (b)     Owner, at Owner's option, may relet the whole or any
          part or parts of the Demised Premises, from time to time, either in
          the name of Owner or otherwise, to such tenant or tenants, for such
          term or terms ending before, on or after the Expiration Date, at such
          rental or rentals and upon such other conditions, which may include
          concessions and free rent periods, as Owner, in its sole discretion,
          may determine. Owner shall have no obligation to relet the Demised
          Premises or any part thereof and shall in no event be liable for
          refusal or failure to relet the Demised Premises or any part thereof,
          or, in the event of any such reletting, for refusal or failure to
          collect any rent due upon any such reletting, and no such refusal or
          failure shall operate to relieve Tenant of any liability under this
          Lease or otherwise to affect any such liability; Owner, at Owner's
          option, may make such repairs,

                                       26

          replacements, alterations, additions, improvements, decorations and
          other physical changes in and to the Demised Premises as Owner, in its
          sole discretion, considers advisable or necessary in connection with
          any such reletting or proposed reletting, without relieving Tenant of
          any liability under this Lease or otherwise affecting any such
          liability.

          Section 17.02.  Waiver of Right to Redeem, etc.:  Tenant hereby waives
                          -------------------------------
the service of any notice of intention to re-enter or to institute legal
proceedings to that end which may otherwise be required to be given under any
present or future law. Tenant, on its own behalf and on behalf of all persons
claiming through or under Tenant, including all creditors, does further hereby
waive any and all rights which Tenant and all such persons might otherwise have
under any present or future law to redeem the Demised Premises, or to re-enter
or repossess the Demised Premises, or to restore the operation of this Lease,
after (i) Tenant shall have been dispossessed by a judgment or by warrant of any
court or judge, or (ii) any re-entry by Owner, or (iii) any expiration or
termination of this Lease and the Demised Term, whether such dispossess, re-
entry, expiration or termination shall be by operation of law or pursuant to the
provisions of this Lease.  The words "re-enter", "re-entry" and "re-entered" as
used in this Lease shall not be deemed to be restricted to their technical legal
meanings.  In the event of a breach or threatened breach by Tenant, or any
persons claiming through or under Tenant, of any term, covenant or condition of
this Lease on Tenant's part to be observed or performed, Owner shall have the
right to enjoin such breach and the right to invoke any other remedy allowed by
law or in equity as if re-entry, summary proceedings and other special remedies
were not provided in this Lease for such breach.  The right to invoke the
remedies hereinbefore set forth in this Lease is cumulative and shall not
preclude Owner from invoking any other remedy allowed by law or in equity.
Owner agrees that the first sentence of this Section 17.02 shall not be deemed a
waiver of Tenant's right to be served with any notice of petition and petition
in any summary proceedings under the provisions of the Real Property Actions and
Proceedings Law of the State of New York and any successor law of like import
then in force.

                                    -------

          Section 18.01.  Amount of Owner's Damages:  If this Lease and the
                          -------------------------
Demised Term shall expire and come to an end as provided  in Article 16, or by
or under any summary proceeding or any other action or proceeding, or if Owner
shall re-enter the Demised Premises as provided in Article 17, or by or under
any summary proceeding or any other action or proceeding, then, in any of said
events:

                  (a)    Tenant shall pay to Owner all Fixed Rent, additional
          rent and other charges payable under this Lease by Tenant to Owner to
          the date upon which this Lease and the Demised Term shall have expired
          and come to an end or to the date of re-entry upon the Demised
          Premises by Owner, as the case may be; and

                  (b)    Tenant shall also be liable for and shall pay to Owner,
          as damages, any deficiency (referred to as a "Deficiency") between the
                                                        ----------
          Fixed Rent reserved in this Lease for the period which otherwise would
          have constituted the unexpired portion of the Demised Term and the net
          amount, if any, of rents collected under any reletting effected
          pursuant to the provisions of Section 17.01 for any part of such
          period (first deducting from the rents collected under any such
          reletting all of Owner's expenses in connection with the termination
          of this Lease or Owner's re-entry upon the Demised Premises and with
          such reletting including, but not limited to, all repossession costs,
          brokerage commissions, legal expenses, attorneys' fees, alteration
          costs and other expenses of preparing the Demised Premises for such
          reletting).  Any such Deficiency shall be paid in monthly installments
          by Tenant on the days specified in this Lease for payment of
          installments of Fixed Rent, Owner shall be entitled to recover from
          Tenant each monthly Deficiency as the same shall arise, and no suit to
          collect the amount of the Deficiency for any month shall prejudice
          Owner's right to collect the Deficiency for any subsequent month by a
          similar proceeding.  Solely for the purposes of this Subsection (b),
          the

                                       27
<PAGE>

          term "Fixed Rent" shall mean the Fixed Rent in effect immediately
          prior to the date upon which this Lease and the Demised Term shall
          have expired and come to an end, or the date of re-entry upon the
          Demised Premises by Owner, as the case may be, adjusted, from time to
          time, to reflect any increases which would have been payable pursuant
          to any of the provisions of this Lease including, but not limited to,
          the provisions of Article 23 of this Lease if the term hereof had not
          been terminated; and

                  (c)    At any time after the Demised Term shall have expired
          and come to an end or Owner shall have re-entered upon the Demised
          Premises, as the case may be, as a result of any Event of Default as
          set forth in subsection (c) or (d) of Section 16.01 whether or not
          Owner shall have collected any monthly Deficiencies as aforesaid,
          Owner shall be entitled to recover from Tenant, and Tenant shall pay
          to Owner, on demand, as and for liquidated and agreed final damages, a
          sum equal to the amount by which the Fixed Rent reserved in this Lease
          for the period which otherwise would have constituted the unexpired
          portion of the Demised Term exceeds the then fair and reasonable
          rental value of the Demised Premises for the same period, both
          discounted to present worth at the rate of eight (8%) percent per
          annum less the aggregate amount of Deficiencies theretofore collected
          by Owner pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section
          for the same period. If, before presentation of proof of such
          liquidated damages to any court, commission or tribunal, the Demised
          Premises, or any part thereof, shall have been relet by Owner for the
          period which otherwise would have constituted the unexpired portion of
          the Demised Term, or any part thereof, the amount of rent reserved
          upon such reletting shall be deemed, prima facie, to be the fair and
          reasonable rental value for the part or the whole of the Demised
          Premises so relet during the term of the reletting. Solely for the
          purposes of this Subsection (c), the term "Fixed Rent" shall mean the
          Fixed Rent in effect immediately prior to the date upon which this
          Lease and the Demised Term shall have expired and come to an end, or
          the date of re-entry upon the Demised Premises by Owner, as the case
          may be, adjusted to reflect any increases pursuant to the provisions
          of Article 23 for the Escalation Year and Tax Escalation Year
          immediately preceding such event.

          Section 18.02.  Rents Under Reletting:  If the Demised Premises, or
                          ---------------------
any part thereof, shall be relet together with other space in the Building, the
rents collected or reserved under any such reletting and the expenses of any
such reletting shall be equitably apportioned for the purposes of this Article
18.  Tenant shall in no event be entitled to any rents collected or payable
under any reletting, whether or not such rents shall exceed the Fixed Rent
reserved in this Lease.  Nothing contained in Articles 16, 17 or this Article
shall be deemed to limit or preclude the recovery by Owner from Tenant of the
maximum amount allowed to be obtained as damages by any statute or rule of law,
or of any sums or damages to which Owner may be entitled in addition to the
damages set forth in Section 18.01.

condition of this Lease on Tenant's part to be observed or performed, Owner, at
any time thereafter and without notice in cases of emergency, and in other cases
after the expiration of the applicable grace period set forth in this Lease, may
remedy such default for Tenant's account and at Tenant's expense, without
thereby waiving any other rights or remedies of Owner with respect to such
default.

                          ------------------------------------------

Tenant agrees to report to Owner, as often as is necessary under such
regulations, the number of workers engaged in employment in the Demised
Premises, the nature of each worker's employment and the residency of each
worker and to provide access to the Demised Premises by employees and agents of

information concerning any violation by Tenant of Section 235 of the Real
Property Law or any Section of Article 150 of the Penal Law or any similar law
of another jurisdiction may submit such information to the Department of Finance
to be considered in determining Owner's eligibility for benefits. Tenant
acknowledges that its obligations under the provisions of Subsection 23.02A may
be greater if Owner fails to obtain a Tax Exemption, and agrees that Owner shall
have no liability to Tenant nor shall Tenant be entitled to any abatement or
diminution of rent if Owner fails to obtain a Tax Exemption.

                    N.  Owner and Tenant acknowledge that Tenant may apply for a
certificate of abatement from the Department of Finance of the City of New York

Owner, to cooperate with Tenant in its efforts to procure a certificate of
abatement including, if necessary, and if Owner

<PAGE>

approves of its contents, co-signing Tenant's application for a certificate of
abatement. Pursuant to the Tax Abatement Program, Owner hereby informs Tenant
that:

                    "(1)  an application for abatement of real property taxes
pursuant to this title will be made for the premises;

                     (2)  the rent, including amounts payable by the tenant for
real property taxes, will accurately reflect any abatement of real property
taxes granted pursuant to this title for the premises;

                     (3)  at least ten dollars per square foot or thirty-five
dollars per square foot must be spent on improvements to the premises and the
common areas, the amount being dependent upon the length of the lease and
whether it is a new or a renewal lease, provided, however, that with respect to
a lease commencing on or after April 1, 1997, if, by the sixtieth (60th) day
following the rent commencement date, the tenant employs one hundred twenty-five
(125) or fewer employees in the relevant premises, at least five dollars per
square foot must be spent on improvements to the premises and the common areas;
and

                     (4)  all abatements granted with respect to a building
pursuant to this title will be revoked if, during the benefit period, real
estate taxes or water or sewer charges or other lienable charges are unpaid for
more than one year, unless such delinquent amounts are paid as provided in
subdivision four of section four hundred ninety-nine-f of this title."

          Tenant agrees that Owner shall have no liability to Tenant nor shall
Tenant be entitled to any abatement or diminution of rent if Tenant fails to
obtain a certificate of abatement under the Tax Abatement Program.

          Section 23.02.  Taxes:  A.  The Fixed Rent for each Tax Escalation
                          -----
Year shall be increased by a sum equal to Tenant's Proportionate Share of Taxes
for such Tax Escalation Year.

                     B.   Unless the Commencement Date shall occur on a July
1st, any increase in the Fixed Rent pursuant to the provisions of Subsection A
of this Section 23.02 for the Tax Escalation Year in which the Commencement Date
shall occur shall be apportioned in that percentage which the number of days in
the period from the Commencement Date to June 30th of such Tax Escalation Year,
both inclusive, bears to the total number of days in such Tax Escalation Year.
Unless the Demised Term shall expire on a June 30th, any increase in the Fixed
Rent pursuant to the provisions of said Subsection A for the Tax Escalation Year
in which the date of the expiration of the Demised Term shall occur shall be
apportioned in that percentage which the number of days in the period from July
1st of such Tax Escalation Year to such date of expiration, both inclusive,
bears to the total number of days in such Tax Escalation Year.

Tenant, either in accordance with the provisions of Article 27 or by personal
delivery at the Demised Premises, an Owner's Tax Statement or Statements with
respect to each Tax Escalation Year, either prior to or during such Tax
Escalation Year. Owner's failure to render an Owner's Tax Statement with respect
to any Tax Escalation Year shall not prejudice Owner's right to recover any sums
due to Owner hereunder with respect to such Tax Escalation Year nor shall it
deprive Tenant of any credit to which it otherwise might be entitled to for any
Tax Escalation Year pursuant to the provisions of subsection B of this Section
23.03. Tenant acknowledges that under present law, Taxes are payable by Owner
(i) with respect to a fiscal year commencing July 1st and ending on the
following June 30th, and (ii) in two (2) installments, in advance, the first of
which is payable on July 1st, and the second and final payment of which is
payable on the following January 1st. Within ten (10) days next following
rendition of the first Owner's Tax Statement which shows an increase in the
Fixed Rent for any Tax Escalation Year, Tenant shall pay to Owner one-half of
the amount of the increase shown upon such Owner's Tax Statement for such Tax
Escalation Year (including any apportionment pursuant to the provisions of
subsection B of Section 23.02); and, subsequently, provided Owner shall have
rendered to Tenant an Owner's Tax Statement, Tenant shall pay to Owner not later
than thirty (30) days prior to the date on which the installment of Taxes is
required to be paid by Owner a sum equal to one half (1/2) of Tenant's
Proportionate Share of Taxes payable with

                                       37
<PAGE>

respect to such Tax Escalation Year as shown on such Owner's Tax Statement.
Tenant further acknowledges that it is the purpose and intent of this Section
23.03 to provide Owner with Tenant's Proportionate Share of Taxes thirty (30)
days prior to the time such installment of Taxes is required to be paid by Owner
without penalty or interest. Accordingly, Tenant agrees if the number of such
installments and/or the date of payment thereof and/or the fiscal year used for
the purpose of Taxes shall change then (a) at the time that any such revised
installment is payable by Owner, Tenant shall pay to Owner the amount which
shall provide Owner with Tenant's Proportionate Share of Taxes applicable to the
revised installment of Taxes then required to be paid by Owner, and (b) this
Article shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change and the time for
payment to Owner of Tenant's Proportionate Share of Taxes as provided in this
Article shall be appropriately revised so that Owner shall always be provided
with Tenant's Proportionate Share of Taxes thirty (30) days prior to the
installment of Taxes required to be paid by Owner. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this subsection A to the contrary, in the event the holder of any
mortgage affecting the Real Property shall require Owner to make monthly
deposits on account of real estate taxes, then this Article shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect the requirement that Owner make monthly
deposits on account of real estate taxes so that Owner shall always be provided
with one-twelfth (1/12th) of Tenant's Proportionate Share of Taxes with respect
to any Tax Escalation Year thirty (30) days prior to the payment by Owner of
such monthly deposits on account of real estate taxes.

                    B.   If, as a result of any application or proceeding
brought by or on behalf of Owner for reduction of the assessed valuation of the
Real Property there shall be a decrease in Taxes for any Tax Escalation Year
with respect to which Owner shall have previously rendered an Owner's Tax
Statement, the next monthly installment or installments of Fixed Rent following
such decrease shall include an adjustment of the Fixed Rent for such Tax
Escalation Year reflecting a credit to Tenant equal to the amount by which (i)
the Fixed Rent actually paid by Tenant with respect to such Tax Escalation Year
(as increased pursuant to the operation of the provisions of subsection A of
Section 23.02), shall exceed (ii) the Fixed Rent payable with respect to such
Tax Escalation Year (as increased pursuant to the operation of the provisions of
subsection A of Section 23.02) based upon such reduction of the assessed
valuation. Tenant shall pay to Owner within thirty (30) days after demand, as
additional rent under this Lease, a sum equal to Tenant's Proportionate Share of
all costs and expenses, including, without limitation, counsel fees, paid or
incurred by Owner in connection with any application or proceeding brought for
reduction of the assessed valuation of the Real Property or any other contest of
Taxes upon the Real Property for any Tax Escalation Year, whether or not such
application, proceeding or other contest was commenced and/or settled and/or
determined prior to the Tax Escalation Year in question. Any outstanding credit
as of the Expiration Date as a result of the operation of the foregoing
provisions hereof shall be paid as cash to Tenant.

    Section 23.04.  Operating Expenses:  A. If Operating Expenses in any
                    ------------------
Escalation Year shall be in such an amount as shall constitute an increase above
Base Operating Expenses, the Fixed Rent for such Escalation Year shall be
increased by a sum equal to Tenant's Proportionate Share of any such increase.
In the event that Base Operating Expenses shall be in excess of Operating
Expenses in any Escalation Year, in no event shall Tenant be entitled to any
such excess and the Fixed Rent shall not be reduced in any way.

                    B.  Unless the Commencement Date shall occur on a January
1st, any increase in the Fixed Rent pursuant to the provisions of Subsection A
of this Section 23.04 for the Escalation Year in which the Commencement Date
shall occur shall be apportioned in that percentage which the number of days in
the period from the Commencement Date to December 31st of such Escalation Year,
both dates inclusive, bears to the total number of days in such Escalation Year.
Unless the Demised Term shall expire on December 31st any increase in the Fixed
Rent pursuant to the provisions of Subsection A of this Section 23.04 for the
Escalation Year in which the date of the expiration of the Demised Term shall
occur shall be apportioned in that percentage which the number of days in the
period from January 1st of such Escalation Year to such date of expiration, both
dates inclusive, bears to the total number of days in such Escalation Year.

                    C.  In the determination of any increase in the Fixed Rent
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 23.04, if the Building
shall not have been fully occupied during any Escalation Year, Operating
Expenses for such Escalation Year shall be equitably adjusted (by including such
additional expenses as Owner would have incurred) to the extent, if any,
required to reflect full occupancy.

          Section 23.05.  Calculation and Payment of Operating Expenses:  A.
                          ---------------------------------------------
Owner shall render to Tenant, either in accordance with the provisions of
Article 27 or by personal delivery at the Demised Premises, an Owner's Operating
Expense Statement with respect to each Escalation Year on or before the next
succeeding October 1st.  Owner's failure to render an Owner's Operating Expense
Statement with respect to any Escalation Year shall not prejudice Owner's right
to recover any sums due to Owner hereunder with respect to such Escalation Year.

                          B.   Within fifteen (15) days next following rendition
of the first Owner's Operating Expense Statement which shows an increase in the
Fixed Rent for any Escalation Year, Tenant shall pay to Owner the entire amount
of such increase. In order to provide for current payments on account of future
potential increases in the Fixed Rent which may be payable by Tenant pursuant to
the provisions of Subsection 23.04.A, Tenant shall also pay to Owner at such
time, provided Owner has given to Tenant a Monthly Escalation Installment
Notice, a sum equal to the product of (i) the Monthly Escalation Installment set
forth in such Notice multiplied by (ii) the number of months or partial months
which shall have elapsed between January 1st of the Escalation Year in which
such payment is made and the date of such payment, less any amounts theretofore
paid by Tenant to Owner on account of increases in the Fixed Rent for such
Escalation Year pursuant to the provisions of the penultimate sentence of this
Subsection 23.05.B; thereafter Tenant shall make payment of a Monthly Escalation
Installment throughout each month of the Demised Term. Monthly Escalation
Installments shall be added to and payable as part of each monthly installment
of Fixed Rent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
foregoing provisions of this Article, prior to the rendition of the first
Owner's Operating Expense Statement which shows an increase in the Fixed Rent
for any Escalation Year, Owner may render to Tenant a pro-forma Owner's
Operating Expense Statement containing a bona fide estimate of the increase in
the Fixed Rent for the Escalation Year in which the Commencement Date shall
occur and/or the subsequent Escalation Year. Following the rendition of such
pro-forma Owner's Operating Expense Statement, Tenant shall pay to Owner a sum
equal to one twelfth (1/12th) of the estimated increase in the Fixed Rent shown
thereon for such Escalation Year or Years multiplied by the number of months
which may have elapsed between the Commencement Date and the month in which such
payment is made and thereafter pay to Owner, on the first day of each month of
the Demised Term (until the rendition by Owner of the first Owner's Operating
Expense Statement) a sum equal to one twelfth (1/12th) of the increase in the
Fixed Rent shown on such pro-forma Owner's Operating Expense Statement. Any sums
paid pursuant to the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be
credited against the sums required to be paid by Tenant to Owner pursuant to the
Owner's Operating Expense Statement for the first Escalation Year for which
there is an increase in the Fixed Rent pursuant to the provisions of Subsection
A.

                          C.   Following rendition of the first Owner's
Operating Expense Statement and each subsequent Owner's Operating Expense
Statement a reconciliation shall be made as follows: Tenant shall be debited
with any increase in the Fixed Rent shown on such Owner's Operating Expense
Statement and credited with the aggregate amount, if any, paid by Tenant in
accordance with the provisions of Subsection B of this Section on account of
future increases in the Fixed Rent pursuant to Subsection 23.04 A. which has not
previously been credited against increases in the Fixed Rent shown on Owner's
Operating Expense Statements. Tenant shall pay any net debit balance to Owner
within fifteen (15) days next following rendition by Owner, either in accordance
with the provisions of Article 27 or by personal delivery at the Demised
Premises of an invoice for such net debit balance; any net credit balance shall
be applied as an adjustment against the next accruing Monthly Escalation
Installment as provided in Subsection L of Section 23.01 or paid promptly, to
Tenant, on or about the Expiration Date.

          Section 23.06.  Dispute Resolution:  A.  In the event of any dispute
                          ------------------
between Owner and Tenant arising out of the application of the Operating Expense
provisions of this Article, such dispute shall be determined by arbitration in
New York City in accordance with the provisions of Article 36. Notwithstanding
any such dispute and submission to arbitration, or any dispute with respect to
the Tax Escalation provisions of this Article (which dispute shall not be
subject to arbitration but which can only be prosecuted by the institution of
legal proceedings by Tenant), any increase in the Fixed Rent shown upon any
Owner's Operating Expense Statement or any Monthly Escalation Installment Notice
or any Owner's Tax Statement shall be payable by Tenant within the time
limitation set forth in this Article. If the determination in such arbitration
or legal proceedings shall be adverse to Owner, any amount paid by Tenant to
Owner in excess of the amount determined to be properly payable shall be
credited against the next

                                       39
<PAGE>

accruing installments of Fixed Rent due under this Lease. However, if there are
no such installments, such amounts shall be paid by Owner to Tenant within ten
(10) days following such determination.

                 B.  In the event Tenant disagrees with any computation or other
matter contained in any Owner's Operating Expense Statement or any Monthly
Escalation Installment Notice, Tenant shall have the right to give notice to
Owner within ninety (90) days next following rendition of such Statement or
Notice setting forth the particulars of such disagreement. If the matter is not
resolved within thirty (30) days next following the giving of such notice by
Tenant, it shall be deemed a dispute which either party may submit to
arbitration pursuant to the provisions of Subsection A of this Section. If (i)
Tenant does not give a timely notice to Owner in accordance with the foregoing
provisions of this Subsection disagreeing with any computation or other matter
contained in any Owner's Operating Expense Statement or any Monthly Escalation
Installment Notice and setting forth the particulars of such disagreement, or
(ii) if any such timely notice shall have been given by Tenant, the matter shall
not have been resolved and neither party shall have submitted the dispute to
arbitration within thirty (30) days next following the giving of such notice by
Tenant, Tenant shall be deemed conclusively to have accepted such Owner's
Operating Expense Statement or Monthly Escalation Installment Notice, as the
case may be, and shall have no further right to dispute the same.

                 C.  (1)  Tenant or its usual auditors of its normal books and
records (provided same are certified public accountants) in each case at
Tenant's expense, shall have the right to examine those portions of Owner's
records which are reasonably required to verify the accuracy of any amounts
shown on any Owner's Operating Expense Statement provided Tenant shall notify
Owner of its desire to so examine such records within sixty (60) days next
following rendition of such Owner's Operating Expense Statement. Owner shall
maintain such records for a period of three (3) years following the expiration
of the Escalation Year to which they relate. Upon Tenant's timely request, Owner
shall make such records available and any such examination shall be conducted at
the office of Owner's accountants or at such other reasonable place designated
by Owner during normal office hours.

                     (2)  Tenant acknowledges and agrees that not more than
three (3) of its employees or three (3) persons employed by such auditors shall
be entitled to entry to the offices of Owner at any one time for the purposes of
such review and inspection. Tenant hereby recognizes the confidential,
privileged and proprietary nature of such records and the information and data
contained therein, as well as any compromise, settlement or adjustment reached
between Owner and Tenant relating to the results of such examination, and Tenant
covenants and agrees for itself, and its employees, agents and representatives
(including, but not limited to, such auditors, and any attorneys or consultants
retained by Tenant as hereinafter provided), that such books, records,
information, data, compromise, settlement and adjustment will be held in the
strictest confidence and not be divulged, disclosed or revealed to any other
person except (x) to the extent required by law, court order or directive of any
Governmental Authority or (y) to such auditors or any attorneys retained by
Tenant or consultants retained by Tenant in connection with any action or
proceeding between Owner and Tenant as to Operating Expenses or Owner's
Operating Expense Statement and no examination of any such records shall be
permitted unless and until such auditors, attorneys and consultants
affirmatively agree and consent to be bound by the provisions of this Section
23.06C.

                     (3)  Tenant agrees that this Section 23.06C is of material
importance to Owner and that any violation thereof shall result in immediate
harm to Owner and Owner shall have all rights allowed by law or equity if
Tenant, its employees, agents, and representatives (including, but not limited
to, such auditors, attorneys or consultants) violate the terms of this Section
23.06C, including, but not limited to, the right to terminate Tenant's right to
audit Owner's records in the future pursuant to this Section 23.06C, and Tenant
shall indemnify and hold Owner harmless of and from all loss, cost, damage,
liability and expense (including, but not limited to counsel fees and
disbursements) arising from a breach of the foregoing obligations of Tenant or
any of its employees, agents and representatives, (including but not limited to,
such auditors, attorneys or consultants). This obligation of Tenant and its
employees, agents and representatives (including, but not limited to, any such
auditors, attorneys or consultants) shall survive the expiration or sooner term
of the Demised Term.

     Section 23.07.  Collection of Increases in Fixed Rent: The obligations of
                     -------------------------------------
Owner and Tenant under the provisions of this Article with respect to any
increase in the Fixed Rent, or any credit to which Tenant may

                                       40
<PAGE>

be entitled, shall survive the expiration or any sooner termination of the
Demised Term. All sums payable by Tenant under this Article shall be collectible
by Owner in the same manner as Fixed Rent.

                                  ARTICLE 24

                                   NO WAIVER
                                   ---------

          Section 24.01.  Owner's Termination Not Prevented:  Neither any option
                          ---------------------------------
granted to Tenant in this Lease or in any collateral instrument to renew or
extend the Demised Term, nor the exercise of any such option by Tenant, shall
prevent Owner from exercising any option or right granted or reserved to Owner
in this Lease or in any collateral instrument or which Owner may have by virtue
of any law, to terminate this Lease and the Demised Term or any renewal or
extension of the Demised Term either during the original Demised Term or during
the renewed or extended term.  Any termination of this Lease and the Demised
Term shall serve to terminate any such renewal or extension of the Demised Term
and any right of Tenant to any such renewal or extension, whether or not Tenant
shall have exercised any such option to renew or extend the Demised Term.  Any
such option or right on the part of Owner to terminate this Lease shall continue
during any extension or renewal of the Demised Term.  No option granted to
Tenant to renew or extend the Demised Term shall be deemed to give Tenant any
further option to renew or extend.

          Section 24.02.  No Termination by Tenant/No Waiver:  No act or thing
                          ----------------------------------
done by Owner or Owner's agents during the Demised Term shall constitute a valid
acceptance of a surrender of the Demised Premises or any remaining portion of
the Demised Term except a written instrument accepting such surrender, executed
by Owner.  No employee of Owner or of Owner's agents shall have any authority to
accept the keys of the Demised Premises prior to the termination of this Lease
and the Demised Term, and the delivery of such keys to any such employee shall
not operate as a termination of this Lease or a surrender of the Demised
Premises; however, if Tenant desires to have Owner sublet the Demised Premises
for Tenant's account, Owner or Owner's agents are authorized to receive said
keys for such purposes without releasing Tenant from any of its obligations
under this Lease, and Tenant hereby relieves Owner of any liability for loss of,
or damage to, any of Tenant's property or other effects in connection with such
subletting.  The failure by Owner to seek redress for breach or violation of, or
to insist upon the strict performance of, any term, covenant or condition of
this Lease on Tenant's part to be observed or performed, shall not prevent a
subsequent act or omission which would have originally constituted a breach or
violation of any such term, covenant or condition from having all the force and
effect of an original breach or violation.  The receipt by Owner of rent with
knowledge of the breach or violation by Tenant of any term, covenant or
condition of this Lease on Tenant's part to be observed or performed shall not
be deemed a waiver of such breach or violation.  Owner's failure to enforce any
Building Rule against Tenant or against any other tenant or occupant of the
Building shall not be deemed a waiver of any such Building Rule.  Owner agrees
to enforce such Building Rules in a uniform manner.  No provision of this Lease
shall be deemed to have been waived by Owner unless such waiver shall be set
forth in a written instrument executed by Owner.  No payment by Tenant or
receipt by Owner of a lesser amount than the aggregate of all Fixed Rent and
additional rent then due under this Lease shall be deemed to be other than on
account of the first accruing of all such items of Fixed Rent and additional
rent then due, no endorsement or statement on any check and no letter
accompanying any check or other rent payment in any such lesser amount and no
acceptance of any such check or other such payment by Owner shall constitute an
accord and satisfaction, and Owner may accept any such check or payment without
prejudice to Owner's right to recover the balance of such rent or to pursue any
other legal remedy.

                        MUTUAL WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY
                        ------------------------------

          Section 25.01.  Owner and Tenant hereby waive trial by jury in any
action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by Owner or Tenant against the other
on any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with this Lease,
the relationship of landlord and tenant, the use or occupancy of the Demised
Premises by Tenant or any person claiming through or under Tenant, any claim of
injury or damage, and any emergency or other statutory remedy; however, the
foregoing waiver shall not apply to any action for personal injury or property
damage.  The provisions of the foregoing sentence shall survive the expiration
or any sooner termination of the Demised Term.  If Owner commences any summary
proceeding, or any other proceeding of like import, Tenant agrees: (i) not to
interpose any counterclaim of whatever nature or description in any such summary
proceeding, or any other proceeding of like import, unless failure to interpose
such counterclaim would preclude Tenant from asserting such claim in a separate
action or proceeding; and (ii) not to seek to remove to another court or
jurisdiction or consolidate any such summary proceeding, or other proceeding of
like import, with any action or proceeding which may have been, or will be,
brought by Tenant.  In the event that Tenant shall breach any of its obligations
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, Tenant agrees (a) to pay all of
Owner's attorneys' fees and disbursements in connection with Owner's enforcement
of such obligations of Tenant and (b) in all events, to pay all accrued, present
and future Fixed Rent and increases therein and additional rent payable pursuant
to the provisions of this Lease.

                             --------------------

          Section 26.01.  If, by reason of strikes or other labor disputes, fire
or other casualty (or reasonable delays in adjustment of insurance), accidents,
any Legal Requirements, any orders of any Governmental Authority or any other
cause beyond Owner's reasonable control, whether or not such other cause shall
be similar in nature to those hereinbefore enumerated, Owner is unable to
furnish or is delayed in furnishing any utility or service required to be
furnished by Owner under the provisions of Article 29 or any other Article of
this Lease or any collateral instrument, or is unable to perform or make or is
delayed in performing or making any installations, decorations, repairs,
alterations, additions or improvements, whether or not required to be performed
or made under this Lease or under any collateral instrument, or is unable to
fulfill or is delayed in fulfilling any of Owner's other obligations under this
Lease or any collateral instrument, no such inability or delay shall constitute
an actual or constructive eviction, in whole or in part, or entitle Tenant to
any abatement or diminution of rent, or relieve Tenant from any of its
obligations under this Lease, or impose any liability upon Owner or its agents
by reason of inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant, or injury to or interruption
of Tenant's business, or otherwise.  Owner shall employ reasonable diligence to
attempt to eliminate the cause of such inability referred to in this Section
(however, the foregoing provisions of this sentence shall not apply in the event
of any strike or labor dispute and Owner shall not be required to employ labor
at overtime or other premium pay rates).

admission of any such new partners, or shareholders, or members, as the case may
be, and, upon demand of Owner, shall cause each such new partner or shareholder
or member to execute and deliver to Owner an agreement, in form satisfactory to
Owner, wherein each such new partner or shareholder or member shall so assume
performance of all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease on
Tenant's part to be observed and performed whether or not the obligation to
comply with such terms, covenants or conditions arose prior to, during or after
any period when any party comprising Partnership Tenant was a member or
shareholder of Partnership Tenant (but neither Owner's failure to request any
such agreement nor the failure of any such new partner, shareholder or member to
execute or deliver any such agreement to Owner shall vitiate the provisions of
subdivision (iv) or any other provision of this Section).

observed or performed, Owner, at Owner's expense, shall furnish heat to the
Demised Premises, as and when required by law, twenty-four (24) hours per day.

          Section 29.03.  Air Conditioning and Ventilation:  As long as Tenant
                          --------------------------------
is not in default under any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease
on Tenant's part to be observed or performed, Owner, at Owner's expense, shall
furnish and distribute to the Demised Premises (i) conditioned air at reasonable
temperatures, pressures and degrees of humidity and in reasonable volumes and
velocities, twenty-four (24) hours per day during the months of May, June, July,
August, September and October when required for the comfortable occupancy of the
Demised Premises; and (ii) mechanical ventilation through the Building air
conditioning system twenty-four (24) hours per day throughout the year, except
when conditioned air or heat is being furnished.  Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section, Owner shall not be responsible if the normal
operation of the Building air conditioning system shall fail to provide
conditioned air at reasonable temperatures, pressures or degrees of humidity or
in reasonable volumes or velocities in any portions of the Demised Premises (a)
which, by reason of any machinery or equipment installed by or on behalf of
Tenant or any person claiming through or under Tenant, shall have an electrical
load in excess of four (4) watts per square foot of usable area for all purposes
(including lighting and power), or which shall have a human occupancy factor in
excess of one person per 100 square feet of usable area (the average electrical
load and human occupancy factors for which the Building air conditioning system
is designed) or (b) because of any rearrangement of partitioning or other
Alterations made or performed by or on behalf of Tenant or any person claiming
through or under Tenant.  Whenever said air conditioning system is in operation,
Tenant agrees to cause all the windows in the Demised Premises to be kept closed
and to cause the venetian blinds in the Demised Premises to be kept closed if
necessary because of the position of the sun.  Tenant agrees to cause all the
windows in the Demised Premises to be closed whenever the Demised Premises are
not occupied.  Tenant shall cooperate fully with Owner at all times and abide by
all regulations and requirements which Owner may reasonably prescribe for the
proper functioning and protection of the air conditioning and ventilating
system.  Tenant agrees that if its violation or breach of any of the foregoing
provisions of this Section, shall adversely affect the operation of the
Building's heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, no such adverse
affects shall constitute an actual or constructive eviction, in whole or in
part, or entitle Tenant to any abatement or diminution of rent, or relieve
Tenant from any of its obligations under this Lease, or impose any liability
upon Owner, or its agents, by reason of inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant, or
injury to or interruption of Tenant's business, or otherwise.  The Building
heating, ventilating and air conditioning system unit serving the floor of the
Building on which the Demised Premises are located shall contain the following
specifications: (1) said unit shall be a water cooled variable air volume (VAV)
unit via a plug fan; (2) said unit shall have a high energy efficiency rating
(EER); (3) said unit shall have a factory mounted economizer coil with controls
which allow water cooling without compressor operation; (4) said unit shall have
factory mounted internal variable frequency drive (VFD); (5) said unit shall
have factory mounted direct digital control (DDC) microprocessor controls; and
(6) said unit shall have internally isolated fans on spring isolators.

          Section 29.04.  Cleaning:  A.  Tenant, at Tenant's expense, shall keep
                          --------
the Demised Premises in order, shall cause the Demised Premises to be cleaned
and shall cause Tenant's refuse and rubbish to be removed, all at regular
intervals in accordance with standards and practices adopted by Owner for the
Building.  Tenant shall cooperate with any waste and garbage recycling program
of the Building and shall comply with all reasonable rules and regulations of
Owner with respect thereto.  Tenant, at Tenant's expense, shall cause all
portions of the Demised Premises used for the storage, preparation, service or
consumption of food or beverages to be cleaned daily in a manner satisfactory to
Owner, and to be exterminated against infestation by vermin, roaches or rodents
regularly and, in addition, whenever there shall be evidence of any infestation.

                          B.  Owner, at Owner's expense, shall clean the public
portions of the Building at regular intervals in accordance with practices and
standards adopted by Owner for the Building.

                          C.  The removal of refuse and rubbish and the
furnishing of office cleaning services to Tenant by persons other than Owner and
its contractors shall be performed in accordance with such regulations and
requirements as, in Owner's judgment, are necessary for the proper operation of
the Building, and Tenant

                                       45
<PAGE>

agrees that Tenant will not permit any person to enter the Demised Premises or
the Building for such purposes, or for the purpose of providing extermination
services required to be performed by Tenant pursuant to Subsection A of this
Section, other than persons first approved by Owner, such approval not
unreasonably to be withheld.

          Section 29.05.  Electricity:  A.  As long as Tenant is not in default
                          -----------
under any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease on Tenant's part
to be observed or performed, Owner shall redistribute or furnish electrical
energy to or for the use of Tenant in the Demised Premises for the operation of
the lighting fixtures and the electrical receptacles installed in the Demised
Premises on the Commencement Date and the operation of the Building heating,
ventilating and air conditioning system unit serving the floor of the Building
on which the Demised Premises are located.  If either the quantity or character
of electrical service is changed by the corporation(s) and/or other entity(ies)
selected by Owner to supply electrical service to the Building or is no longer
available or suitable for Tenant's requirements, or if any equipment
supplementing or ancillary to such electrical service which is installed in the
Building by or on behalf of said corporation(s) and/or other entity(ies)
malfunctions or fails to operate for any reason while Tenant has made any
connections to said equipment, no such change, unavailability, unsuitability,
malfunction or failure to operate shall constitute an actual or constructive
eviction, in whole or in part, or entitle Tenant to any abatement or diminution
of rent, or relieve Tenant from any of its obligations under this Lease, or
impose any liability upon Owner, or its agents, by reason of inconvenience or
annoyance to Tenant, or injury to or interruption of Tenant's business or
otherwise.

                          B.  Owner represents that the electrical feeder or
riser capacity serving the Demised Premises on the Commencement Date shall be
adequate to serve the lighting fixtures and electrical receptacles installed in
the Demised Premises on the Commencement Date. Any additional feeders or risers
to supply Tenant's additional electrical requirements, and all other equipment
proper and necessary in connection with such feeders or risers shall be
installed by Owner upon Tenant's request, at the sole cost and expense of
Tenant, provided, that, in Owner's reasonable judgment, such additional feeders
or risers are necessary and are permissible under applicable laws and insurance
regulations and the installation of such feeders or risers will not cause
permanent damage or injury to the Building or the Demised Premises or cause or
create a dangerous or hazardous condition or entail excessive or unreasonable
alterations or repairs to or interfere with or disturb other tenants or
occupants of the Building. Tenant covenants that at no time shall the use of
electrical energy in the Demised Premises exceed the capacity of the existing
feeders or risers or wiring installations then serving the Demised Premises.

                          C.  Prior to the Commencement Date Owner, at Owner's
expense, shall have installed a submeter or submeters in the Demised Premises to
measure Tenant's actual consumption of electricity in the entire Demised
Premises. Tenant shall pay to Owner, from time to time, upon demand, for the
electricity consumed in the Demised Premises, as determined by such submeter or
submeters, the actual cost to Owner of purchasing electricity for the Demised
Premises (as such actual cost is hereinafter defined) plus all applicable taxes
thereon. Owner's actual cost for Tenant's KW and KWH shall be determined by the
application of the Building's electric rate schedule per month from the
corporation(s) and/or other entity(ies) selected by Owner to supply electrical
service to the Building to Tenant's usage. With respect to any period when any
such submeter is not in good working order, Tenant shall pay Owner for
electricity consumed in the portion of the Demised Premises served by such
submeter at the rate paid by Tenant to Owner during the most recent comparable
period when such submeter was in good working order. Tenant shall take good care
of any such submeter and all submetering installation equipment, at Tenant's
sole cost and expense, and make all repairs thereto occasioned by any acts,
omissions or negligence of Tenant or any person claiming through or under Tenant
as and when necessary to insure that any such submeter is, at all times during
the Demised Term, in good working order. With respect to the period (referred to
as the "Interim Period"), if any, from the Commencement Date through the date
        --------------
immediately prior to the date upon which the submeter or submeters shall be
operable, Tenant shall pay to Owner monthly on demand of Owner, for the
electricity consumed in the Demised Premises, a sum equal to one-twelfth
(1/12th) of the product of (x) $1.50 multiplied by (y) the Demised Premises
Area. With respect to any period during the Interim Period constituting less
than a full calendar month, the monthly payment referred to in the preceding
sentence shall be appropriately prorated.

                                       46
<PAGE>

                          D.  Owner may, at any time, elect to discontinue the
redistribution or furnishing of electrical energy. In the event of any such
election by Owner, (i) Owner agrees to give reasonable advance notice of any
such discontinuance to Tenant, (ii) Owner agrees to permit Tenant to receive
electrical service directly from the corporation(s) and/or other entity(ies)
selected by Owner to supply electrical service to the Building and to permit the
existing feeders, risers, wiring and other electrical facilities serving the
Demised Premises to be used by Tenant for such purpose to the extent they are
suitable and safely capable, (iii) Owner agrees to pay such charges and costs,
if any, as such corporation(s) and/or other entity(ies) may impose in connection
with the installation of Tenant's meters, (iv) the provisions of Subsection C of
this Section 29.05 shall be deemed deleted from this Lease, and (v) this Lease
shall remain in full force and effect and such discontinuance shall not
constitute an actual or constructive eviction, in whole or in part, or entitle
Tenant to any abatement or diminution of rent, or relieve Tenant from any of its
obligations under this Lease, or impose any liability upon Owner or its agents
by reason of inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant, or injury to or interruption
of Tenant's business, or otherwise.

                          E.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Lease, any sums payable or granted in any way by the corporation(s)
and/or other entity(ies) selected by Owner to supply electricity to the Building
resulting from the installation in the Demised Premises of energy efficient
lighting fixtures, lamps, special supplemental heating, ventilation and air
conditioning systems or any other Alterations, which sums are paid or given by
way of rebate, direct payment, credit or otherwise, shall be and remain the
property of Owner, and Tenant shall not be entitled to any portion thereof,
unless such lighting fixtures, lamps, supplemental heating, ventilation and air
conditioning systems or other Alterations were installed by Tenant, solely at
Tenant's expense, without any contribution, credit or allowance by Owner, in
accordance with all of the provisions of this Lease. Nothing contained in the
foregoing sentence, however, shall be deemed to obligate Owner to supply or
install in the Demised Premises any such lighting fixtures, lamps, supplemental
heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems or other Alterations.

                          F.  Tenant acknowledges that the Building heating,
ventilating and air conditioning system unit serving the floor of the Building
on which the Demised Premises are located (referred to herein as the "Floor HVAC
Unit") shall not be connected to the submeter(s) serving the Demised Premises,
but, instead, shall be connected to a separate meter(s) measuring the electrical
energy consumed by such Floor HVAC Unit. Accordingly, Tenant agrees that during
the Demised Term, Tenant shall pay to Owner, from time to time upon demand of
Owner and submission by Owner to Tenant of invoices or bills therefor, thirty-
three and 24/100 (33.24%) percent (hereinafter "Tenant's Electrical Share") of
all amounts shown on said separate meter(s) for such Floor HVAC Unit.

                          G.  Tenant acknowledges that the light and power
systems serving the public areas of the floor of the Building on which the
Demised Premises are located (referred to herein as the "Floor Public Light and
Power") shall not be connected to the submeter(s) serving the Demised Premises
but, instead, shall be connected to a separate meter(s) measuring the electrical
energy consumed by such Floor Public Light and Power. Accordingly, Tenant agrees
that during the Demised Term, Tenant shall pay to Owner, from time to time upon
demand of Owner and submission by Owner to Tenant of invoices or bills therefor,
Tenant's Electrical Share of all amounts shown on said separate meter(s) for
such Floor Public Light and Power.

          Section 29.06.  Water:  If Tenant requires, uses or consumes water for
                          -----
any purpose in addition to ordinary lavatory and drinking purposes, Owner may
install a hot water meter and a cold water meter and thereby measure Tenant's
consumption of water for all purposes.  Tenant shall pay to Owner the cost of
any such meters and their installation, and Tenant shall keep any such meters
and any such installation equipment in good working order and repair, at
Tenant's cost and expense.  Tenant agrees to pay for water consumed as shown on
said meters, and sewer charges, taxes and any other governmental charges
thereon, as and when bills are rendered.  In addition to any sums required to be
paid by Tenant for hot water consumed and sewer charges, taxes and any other
governmental charges thereon under the foregoing provisions of this Section,
Tenant agrees to pay to Owner, for the heating of said hot water, an amount
equal to three (3X) times the total of said sums required to be paid by Tenant
for hot water and sewer charges thereon.  For the purposes of determining the
amount of any sums required to be paid by Tenant under this Section, all hot and
cold water consumed during any period when said meters are not in good working
order shall be deemed to have

                                       47
<PAGE>

been consumed at the rate of consumption of such water during the most
comparable period when such meters were in good working order.

          Section 29.07.  Overtime Periods:  The Fixed Rent does not reflect or
                          ----------------
include any charge to Tenant for the furnishing or distributing of any necessary
elevator facilities (other than an elevator subject to call) to the Demised
Premises during periods (referred to as "Overtime Periods") other than the hours
                                         ----------------
and days set forth above in this Article for the furnishing and distributing of
such services.  Accordingly, if Owner shall furnish any such elevator facilities
to the Demised Premises at the request of Tenant during Overtime Periods, Tenant
shall pay Owner for such services at the following rates as of the date of this
Lease: $65.00 Dollars per hour for freight elevator service.  Any increases
above such rates shall be in an amount equal to the actual increases after the
date of this Lease in the cost to Owner of furnishing such services.  Owner
shall not be required to furnish any such services during Overtime Periods,
unless Owner has received reasonable advance notice from Tenant requesting such
services.  If Tenant fails to give Owner reasonable advance notice requesting
such services during any Overtime Periods, then, failure by Owner to furnish any
such services during such Overtime Periods shall not constitute an actual or
constructive eviction, in whole or in part, or entitle Tenant to any abatement
or diminution of rent, or relieve Tenant from any of its obligations under this
Lease, or impose any liability upon Owner or its agents by reason of
inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant, or injury to or interruption of Tenant's
business or otherwise.

          Section 29.08.  Owner's Right to Stop Service:  Owner reserves the
                          -----------------------------
right to stop the service of the heating, air conditioning, ventilating,
elevator, plumbing, electrical, communications or other mechanical systems or
facilities in the Building when necessary by reason of accident or emergency, or
for repairs, alterations, replacements or improvements, which, in the judgment
of Owner are desirable or necessary, until said repairs, alterations,
replacements or improvements shall have been completed.  The exercise of such
right by Owner shall not constitute an actual or constructive eviction, in whole
or in part, or entitle Tenant to any abatement or diminution of rent, or relieve
Tenant from any of its obligations under this Lease, or impose any liability
upon Owner or its agents by reason of inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant, or
injury to or interruption of Tenant's business, or otherwise.  Owner shall
employ reasonable diligence in attempting to restore the operation of any such
systems or facilities without any obligation, however, to employ labor at
overtime or other premium pay rates.

          Section 29.09.  A.  Tenant's Supplemental A/C Unit/Cooling Tower:
                              --------------------------------------------
Supplementing the provisions of Section 29.06, in the event (a) a separate air
conditioning system to serve the Demised Premises is installed by or on behalf
of Tenant in accordance with the provisions of this Lease (referred to herein as
"Tenant's Supplemental A/C Unit"), (b) Tenant requests that such Unit be hooked
 ------------------------------
up to any Building cooling tower and associated piping (referred to herein as
the "Cooling Tower") and (c) Owner consents to such hookup, then, in those
     -------------
events, Owner agrees, subject to the provisions of Article 26 and Section 29.08,
to supply condenser water to Tenant's Supplemental A/C Unit and Tenant agrees
that (i) Tenant shall pay to Owner, upon demand, all costs and expenses incurred
by Owner in connection with the hookup of such Unit to the Cooling Tower,
including, but not limited to, the Building standard hookup fee then charged by
Owner, and (ii) from and after the date the hookup is completed, the Fixed Rent
reserved in this Lease shall be increased by a sum (referred to herein as the
"Tenant's Cooling Tower Use Charge") equal to (x) the standard per ton charge
- ----------------------------------
then in effect in the Building, multiplied by (xx) the number of tons of
Tenant's Supplemental A/C Unit.

                          B.  If the regular hourly wage rate of operating
engineers employed in the Building shall be increased in any Escalation Year (as
defined in Article 23) over the rate in effect on the January 1/st/ immediately
preceding such hookup, the Fixed Rent for such Escalation Year shall be
increased by a sum equal to that proportion of Tenant's Cooling Tower Use Charge
which such increase in said hourly wage rate bears to the hourly wage rate in
effect on the January 1/st/ immediately preceding such hookup. The increase in
Fixed Rent for any Escalation Year pursuant to the provisions of the immediately
preceding sentence shall be shown on the Owner's Operating Expense Statement
with respect to such Escalation Year rendered by Owner pursuant to the
provisions of said Article 23, and shall be payable by Tenant as if it were an
increase in the Fixed Rent pursuant to the provisions of said Article 23.

                                       48

                          C.  Any increase in Fixed Rent for Tenant's Cooling
Tower Use Charge shall be effective as of the date Tenant's Supplemental A/C
Unit is hooked up to the Cooling Tower and shall be retroactive to such date if
necessary.

                          D.  Tenant's Supplemental A/C Unit shall be repaired
and maintained by Tenant at Tenant's cost and expense, pursuant to a service
contract.

                                   --------
persons as the Chairman may designate, whose determination shall be final and
conclusive upon Owner and Tenant.  Tenant's right to dispute the reasonableness
of any additional Building Rule shall be deemed waived unless asserted by
service of a notice upon Owner within ten (10) days after the date upon which
Owner shall give notice to Tenant of the adoption of any such additional
Building Rule.  Owner shall have no duty or obligation to enforce any Building
Rule, or any term, covenant or condition of any other lease, against any other
tenant or occupant of the Building, and Owner's failure or refusal to enforce
any Building Rule or any term, covenant or condition of any other lease against
any other tenant or occupant of the Building shall not constitute an actual or
constructive eviction, in whole or in part, or entitle Tenant to any abatement
or diminution of rent, or relieve Tenant from any of its obligations under this
Lease, or impose any liability upon Owner or its agents by reason of
inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant, or injury to or interruption of Tenant's
business, or otherwise.  Any Building Rule not enforced generally against other
tenants of the Building shall not be enforced against Tenant.

          Section 33.02.  Any Building Rule not enforced generally against other
tenants of the Building shall not be enforced against Tenant.  Wherever the
Building Rules provide for a matter to be determined by Owner or its agents,
Owner or its agents shall exercise their reasonable judgment with respect
thereto and any determination to be made by Owner or its agents thereunder shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                                    ------

          Section 34.01.  Tenant represents and warrants to Owner that this
Lease was negotiated directly between Owner and Tenant and that no broker was
responsible for bringing about this Lease.  Tenant shall indemnify

                                       50
<PAGE>

Owner from all loss, cost, liability, damage and expenses, including, but not
limited to, reasonable counsel fees and disbursements, arising from any breach
of the foregoing representation and warranty.

                                  ARTICLE 35

          Section 35.01.  The sum of NINETEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FORTY-FOUR
and 00/100 ($19,944.00) DOLLARS representing security (referred to as
"Security") for the faithful performance and observance by Tenant of the terms,
 --------
covenants and conditions of this Lease on Tenant's part to be observed and
performed is due and payable at the time of the execution and delivery of this
Lease.  In the event of any default by Tenant in the observance or performance
of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease on the part of Tenant
to be observed or performed including, but not limited to, any default in the
payment when due of any monthly installment of the Fixed Rent or increase in the
Fixed Rent payable pursuant to the provisions of Articles 23 or 29 or of any
additional rent, Owner may use or apply all or any part of the Security for the
payment to Owner for Tenant's account of any sum or sums due under this Lease,
without thereby waiving any other rights or remedies of Owner with respect to
such default.  Tenant agrees to replenish all or any part of the Security so
used or applied during the Demised Term.  After (i) the Expiration Date or any
other date upon which the Demised Term shall expire and come to an end, and (ii)
the full observance and performance by Tenant of all of the terms, covenants and
conditions of this Lease on Tenant's part to be observed and performed,
including, but not limited to, the provisions of Article 21, Owner shall return
to Tenant the balance of the Security then held or retained by Owner.  Owner
agrees that, unless prohibited by law  or by the general policies of lending
institutions in New York City, Owner shall deposit the Security in an interest-
bearing savings account with a bank selected by Owner, in which event all
interest accruing thereon shall be added to and become part of the Security and
shall be retained by Owner under the same conditions as the sum originally
deposited as Security.  Tenant agrees that Tenant shall not assign or encumber
any part of the Security, and no assignment or encumbrance by Tenant of all or
any part of the Security shall be binding upon Owner, whether made prior to,
during, or after the Demised Term.  Owner shall not be required to exhaust its
remedies against Tenant or against the Security before having recourse to any
other form of security held by Owner and recourse by Owner to any form of
security shall not affect any remedies of Owner which are provided in this Lease
or which are available to Owner in law or equity.  In the event of any sale,
assignment or transfer by Owner named herein (or by any subsequent Owner) of its
interest in the Building as owner or lessee, Owner (or such subsequent owner)
shall have the right to assign or transfer the Security to its grantee, assignee
or transferee and, in the event of such assignment or transfer, Owner named
herein, (or such subsequent Owner) shall have no liability to Tenant for the
return of the Security and Tenant shall look solely to the grantee, assignee or
transferee for such return.  A lease of the entire Building shall be deemed a
transfer within the meaning of the foregoing sentence.  Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in the foregoing provisions of this Article, Owner
shall be entitled to retain the one (1%) percent administrative fee permitted by
law to be retained by landlords with respect to security deposits.

                                  ARTICLE 36

                               ARBITRATION, ETC.
                               -----------------

          Section 36.01.  Any dispute (i) with respect to the reasonability of
any failure or refusal of Owner to grant its consent or approval to any request
for such consent or approval pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.01 or
11.03 with respect to which request Owner has agreed, in such Sections, not
unreasonably to withhold such consent or approval, or (ii) arising out of the
application of the Operating Expenses provisions of Article 23, (iii) as to the
validity of any assignment in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.06
which is submitted to arbitration shall be finally determined by arbitration in
the City of New York in accordance with the rules and regulations then obtaining
of the American Arbitration Association or its successor.  Any such determi-

                                       51
<PAGE>

nation shall be final and binding upon the parties, whether or not a judgment
shall be entered in any court. In making their determination, the arbitrators
shall not subtract from, add to, or otherwise modify any of the provisions of
this Lease. Owner and Tenant may, at their own expense, be represented by
counsel and employ expert witnesses in any such arbitration. Any dispute with
respect to the reasonability of any failure or refusal of Owner to grant its
consent or approval to any request for such consent or approval pursuant to any
of the provisions of this Lease (other than Sections 3.01 and 11.03) with
respect to which Owner has covenanted not unreasonably to withhold such consent
or approval, and any dispute arising with respect to the increases in Fixed Rent
due to the provisions of Section 23.02 shall be determined by applicable legal
proceedings. If the determination of any such legal proceedings, or of any
arbitration held pursuant to the provisions of this Section with respect to
disputes arising under Sections 3.01, 11.03 and 11.06 or the Operating Expense
provisions of Article 23, shall be adverse to Owner, Owner shall be deemed to
have granted the requested consent or approval, or be bound by any determination
as to Taxes and Operating Expenses and the increases in Fixed Rent relating
thereto, or the validity of any assignment, but that shall be Tenant's sole
remedy in such event and Owner shall not be liable to Tenant for a breach of
Owner's covenant not unreasonably to withhold such consent or approval, or
otherwise. Each party shall pay its own counsel and expert witness fees and
expenses, if any, in connection with any arbitration held pursuant to the
provisions of this Section and the parties will share all other expenses and
fees of any such arbitration.

                                  ARTICLE 37

                                 PARTIES BOUND
                                 -------------

          Section 37.01.  The terms, covenants and conditions contained in this
Lease shall bind and inure to the benefit of Owner and Tenant and, except as
otherwise provided in this Lease, their respective heirs, distributees,
executors, administrators, successors and assigns.  However, the obligations of
Owner under this Lease shall no longer be binding upon Owner named herein after
the sale, assignment or transfer by Owner named herein (or upon any subsequent
Owner after the sale, assignment or transfer by such subsequent Owner) of its
interest in the Building as owner or lessee, and in the event of any such sale,
assignment or transfer, such obligations shall thereafter be binding upon the
grantee, assignee or other transferee of such interest, and any such grantee,
assignee or transferee, by accepting such interest, shall be deemed to have
assumed such obligations.  A lease of the entire Building shall be deemed a
transfer within the meaning of the foregoing sentence.  Neither the partners
(direct or indirect) comprising Owner, nor the shareholders (nor any of the
partners comprising same), partners, directors or officers of any of the
foregoing (collectively, the "Owner's Parties") shall be liable for the
                              ---------------
performance of Owner's obligations under this Lease.  Tenant shall look solely
to Owner to enforce Owner's obligations hereunder and shall not seek any damages
against any of the Owner's Parties.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall look solely to the estate and interest of
Owner, its successors and assigns, in the Real Property and Building for the
collection or satisfaction of any judgment recovered against Owner based upon
the breach by Owner of any of the terms, conditions or covenants of this Lease
on the part of Owner to be performed, and no other property or assets of Owner
or any of Owner's Parties shall be subject to levy, execution or other
enforcement procedure for the satisfaction of Tenant's remedies under or with
respect to either this Lease, the relationship of landlord and tenant hereunder,
or Tenant's use and occupancy of the Demised Premises.

     1.  The sidewalks, entrances, passages, courts, elevators, vestibules,

offices, and upon notice from Owner, such tenant or occupant shall refrain from
or discontinue such advertising.

merchandise, freight or other matter, any hand trucks or other means of
conveyance except those equipped with rubber tires, rubber side guards and such
other safeguards as Owner may require.

     23.  If the premises demised to any tenant become infested with vermin,
such tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall cause its premises to be
exterminated, from time to time, to the satisfaction of Owner, and shall employ
such exterminators therefor as shall be approved by Owner.

     24.  No premises shall be used, or permitted to be used, at any time, as a
store for the sale or display of goods, wares or merchandise of any kind, or as
a restaurant, shop, booth, bootblack or other stand, or for the conduct of any
business or occupation which predominantly involves direct patronage of the
general public in the premises demised to such tenant, or for manufacturing or
for other similar purposes.

     25.  No tenant shall clean, or permit to be cleaned, any window of the
Building from the outside in violation of Section 202 of the New York Labor Law
or any successor law or statute, or of the rules of the Board of Standards and
Appeals or of any board or body having or asserting jurisdiction.

     26.  No tenant shall move, or permit to be moved, into or out of the
Building or the premises demised to such tenant, any heavy or bulky matter,
without the specific approval of Owner.  If any such matter requires special
handling, only a person holding a Master Rigger's license shall be employed to
perform such special handling.  No tenant shall place, or permit to be placed,
on any part of the floor or floors of the premises demised to such tenant, a
load exceeding the floor load per square foot which such floor was designed to

weight and position of safes and other heavy matter, which must be placed so as
to distribute the weight.

building or Premises, as applicable, which shall allow use of the Premises by
Sublessee for its business. Sublessor shall notify Sublessee at least (15) days

expected to be achieved. All warranties shall be deemed to commence as of the
Substantial Completion date, except those as specified on the "punch list".

2.6  Sublessor shall provide a warranty to Sublessee with respect to all work
performed by or on behalf of Sublessor for a period of one year after the Term
Commencement Date, and shall, at Sublessor's sole cost and expense, promptly

Thereafter, Sublessor agrees that it shall assign to Sublessee or exercise on
Sublessee's behalf any and all warranties available to it from contractors,
subcontractors or suppliers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, latent defects in
the Base Building Work shall be repaired by Sublessor at Sublessor's sole cost
and expense whenever the same are discovered, whether or not within the one-year
warranty period and the cost of such repairs shall not be included within
Operating Expenses.

2.7  Provided that Sublessee and its employees, agents and contractors do not
unreasonably interfere with Sublessor's work in the Premises, Sublessor shall
allow Sublessee access to the Premises to install cabling, furniture and
equipment during construction of the Leasehold Improvement Work.

2.8  Sublessor shall pay the entire cost of the Base Building Work. Sublessor

     If the actual fit up cost is greater than $2,436,496, then the difference

the Leasehold Improvement Work progresses, provided however, that if such
increases shall have accumulated from the commencement of construction and not
have been billed by Sublessor, upon the discovery of any such unbilled
increases, the Sublessee shall make payment thereof within 10 days of
Sublessor's notice. Any unused allowance amount shall be applied against rent

the sublessees.

4.3.2.  Sublessee's Payments. (a) The Sublessee shall be responsible for
- ----------------------------
        Sublessee's Proportionate Share of Operating Expenses.

(b) At the commencement of this Lease, the Sublessor shall estimate the
Operating Expenses, and utility expenses. As of each anniversary date the
Sublessor shall reconcile the estimated expenses with the actual expenses, and
determine the estimated payments for the next 12 month period. Estimated
payments by Sublessee on account of Sublessee's Proportionate Share of Operating
Expenses shall be made monthly and at the time and in the fashion herein
provided for the payment of Base Rent. After the end of each Operating Year,
Sublessor shall submit to Sublessee a reasonably detailed accounting of
Operating Expenses for such Year, and Sublessor shall certify to the accuracy
thereof. If estimated payments theretofore made for such Year by Sublessee
exceed Sublessee's required payment on account thereof for such Year, according
to such statement, Sublessor shall credit the amount of overpayment against
subsequent obligations of Sublessee with respect to Operating Expenses (or
refund such overpayment if the Term of this Sublease has ended and Sublessee has
no further obligation to Sublessor), but, if the required payments on account
thereof for such Year are greater than the estimated payments (if any)
theretofore made on account thereof for such Year, Sublessee shall make payment
to Sublessor within thirty (30) days after being so advised by Sublessor.
Sublessor shall have the same rights and remedies for the nonpayment by

                                       15
<PAGE>

Sublessee of any payments due on account of Operating Expenses as Sublessor has
hereunder for the failure of Sublessee to pay Base Rent.

(c) "Sublessee's Proportionate Share" shall mean a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of rentable feet in the Premises, and the denominator of
which is the number of rentable square feet in the Building as determined in
accordance with BOMA Methodology

4.3.3 Sublessee's Audit Right.  Sublessor shall keep, in the Building manager's
office, complete books and records regarding Operating Expenses and real estate
taxes (collectively, "Charges").  All such records shall be retained for at
least three (3) years.  Sublessee shall have the right to audit such records at
any time upon reasonable written notice to Sublessor.  If such audit reveals
that Sublessee's pro rata share of any Charges has been overstated, then
Sublessor shall immediately refund the overpayment plus interest at the Lease
Interest Rate and if overstated by more than five percent (5%) cumulatively,
Sublessor shall promptly upon demand reimburse Sublessee for the costs of such
audit.

4.4. RENT DURING OPTION PERIOD
- ------------------------------

     In the event that the Sublessee shall exercise its option to renew for
either additional five (5) year period, the annual rent during that period shall
be 95% of the then Current Market Rent Rate for the premises but in no case
shall the rent be less than the previous years Base Rent. The term "Current
Market Rent Rate" for purposes of this Sublease shall mean the annual amount per
rentable square foot that a willing, comparable, new, non-renewal, non-equity,
nonexpansion Sublessee of credit quality similar to Sublessee would pay, and a
willing comparable Sublessor of the Building or a comparable office building in
the immediate vicinity of the Building would accept, at arms length, giving
appropriate consideration to annual rental rates per rentable square foot,
escalation clauses (including type, gross or net, and if gross, whether base
year or expense stop), and abatement provisions reflecting free rent, tenant
improvement allowances, length of lease term, size, condition and location of
premises being leased.

     If Sublessee exercises the extension option, Sublessor and Sublessee shall
attempt to agree upon the Current Market rental Rate using their best good-faith
efforts.  If Sublessor and Sublessee fail to reach an agreement within thirty
(30) days following Sublessee's exercise of such extension option (the "Outside
Agreement Date"), then each party shall make a separate determination of the
current Market Rental Rate which shall be submitted to each other and to
arbitration in accordance with the following items (i) through (vii):

     (i)  Sublessor and Sublessee shall each appoint, within ten (10)
business days of the Outside Agreement Date, one arbitrator who shall by
profession be a licensed, qualified MAI appraiser of comparable properties in
the immediate vicinity of the Building, and who has been active in such field
over the last five (5) years.  The determination of the arbitrators shall be
limited solely to

                                       16
<PAGE>

the issue of whether Sublessor's or Sublessee's submitted Current Market Rental
Rate is the closes to the actual Current Market Rental Rate as determined by the
arbitrators.

     (ii)   The two arbitrators so appointed shall within five (5) business days
of the date of the appointment of the last appointed arbitrator agree upon and
appoint a third arbitrator who shall be qualified under the same criteria set
forth hereinabove for qualification of the initial tow arbitrators.

     (iii)  The third arbitrator shall within fifteen (15) days of the
appointment reach a decision as to whether the parties shall use Sublessor's or
Sublessee's submitted current Market Rent Rate, or such other Rent Rate as
determined by the third appraiser and shall notify Sublessor and Sublessee
thereof.

     (iv)   If either Sublessor or Sublessee fails to appoint an arbitrator
within ten (10) business days after the applicable outside Agreement Date, the
arbitrator appointed by one of them shall reach a decision, notify Sublessor and
Sublessee thereof, and such arbitrator's decision shall be binding upon
Sublessor and Sublessee.

     (v)    If the two arbitrators fail to agree upon and appoint a third
arbitrator, parties fail to appoint an arbitrator, then the appointment of the
third arbitrator or any arbitrator shall be dismissed and the matter to be
decided shall be forthwith submitted to arbitration under the provisions of the
American Arbitration Association, but subject to the instruction set forth in
this Section 3.3.

     (vi)   The cost of arbitration shall be paid by Sublessor and Sublessee
equally.

     The exercise of the first five (5) year prior by the Sublessee shall
entitle the Sublessee up to a $10.00 per square foot allowance to improve or
renovate the leased premises.  The exercise of the second five (5) year option
shall entitle the Sublessee up to a $2.00 per square foot carpeting allowance.

     All other additional rent shall also be paid, as provided in Section 4.5
above.

notify the Sublessee of  the amount due hereunder which shall be paid by the
Sublessee within 10 days of such notification.  At the commencement of this
Lease, and until such taxes are assessed, estimated taxes at $1.75 per square
foot shall be paid by the Sublessee.  The Sublessor shall also estimate the

costs, interest or penalties associated therewith, and the Sublessee shall not
be responsible for any amounts beyond the tax payment obligation under Paragraph
5.1 above.  Sublessee shall have the right at its sole cost and expenses to file
tax abatement proceedings after providing a 10 day notice of such action with
the Sublessor and after a consultation discussion with the Sublessor which shall

therein and without subjecting Sublessor to any liability, civil or criminal,
for failure so to comply therewith, Sublessee may delay compliance therewith
consistent with such court order.  Even if such lien, charge or civil liability
would be incurred by reason of any such delay, Sublessee may, with the prior
written consent of Sublessor, contest as aforesaid and delay as aforesaid,
provided that such contest or delay does not subject Sublessor to criminal
liability, damages or expense and provided that Sublessee: (i) furnishes to
Sublessor security, reasonably satisfactory to Sublessor, against any loss or
injury by reason of such contest or delay; and (ii) prosecutes the contest with
due diligence.

brought by and/or in the name of Sublessor and/or PDA and Sublessor and/or PDA
determines that such action is in its best interests, in which event Sublessor

its name, if Sublessee shall pay all expenses in connection therewith.

expressly provided otherwise in this Sublease. Except to the extent set forth in
Section 4.3.1(ii), all costs and expenses incurred by Sublessor in performing
its obligations under this Section shall be included in Operating Expenses.

14.2.   Any services which Sublessor is required to furnish pursuant to the
- -----
provisions of this Sublease may, at Sublessor's option be furnished from time to
time, in whole or in part, by employees of Sublessor or by the Manager of the
Property or by one or more third persons and Sublessor further reserves the
right to require Sublessee to enter into agreements with such persons in form
and content approved by Sublessor for the furnishing of such services. Sublessor
shall cause the paved portions of the Property to be kept reasonably free and
clear of snow, ice and refuse and shall cause the landscaped areas of the
Property to be maintained in a reasonably attractive appearance.

14.3.   Sublessee's Agreement (a) Sublessee will keep neat and clean and
- -----   ---------------------
maintain in good order, condition and repair the Premises and every part
thereof, excepting only those repairs for which Sublessor is responsible under
the terms of this Sublease, and reasonable wear and tear of the Premises, and
damage by fire or other casualty and as a consequence of the exercise of the
power of eminent domain; (b) If repairs are required to be made by Sublessee
pursuant to the terms hereof, Sublessor may demand that Sublessee make the same
forthwith, and if Sublessee refuses or neglects to commence such repairs and
complete the same with reasonable dispatch after such demand, Sublessor may (but
shall not be required to do so) after 30 days prior written notice to Sublessee
stating Sublessor's intentions to exercise self help remedies make or cause such
repairs to be made (the provisions of Section 14.18 being applicable to the
costs thereof) and shall not be responsible to Sublessee for any loss or damage
that may accrue to Sublessee's stock or business by reason thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sublessor may elect to take action hereunder
immediately without notice to Sublessee if Sublessor reasonably believes an
emergency to exist, and Sublessor shall provide notice of its action to
Sublessee as soon as practicable..

14.4.   Floor Load - Heavy Machinery. (a) Sublessee shall not place a load upon
- -----   -----------------------------
any floor in the Premises exceeding 100 lbs per square foot. Sublessor reserves
the right to prescribe the weight and position of all business machines and

                                       32
<PAGE>

mechanical equipment, including safes, which shall be placed so as to distribute
the weight. Business machines and mechanical equipment shall be placed and
maintained by Sublessee at Sublessee's expense in settings sufficient, in
Sublessor's judgment, to absorb and prevent vibration, noise and annoyance.
Sublessee shall not move any safe, heavy machinery, heavy equipment, freight,
bulky matter or fixtures into or out of the Building without Sublessor's prior
consent, which consent may include a requirement to provide insurance, naming
Sublessor as an insured, in such amounts as Sublessor may deem reasonable.

(b) If such safe, machinery, equipment, freight, bulky matter or fixtures
requires special handling, Sublessee agrees to employ only persons holding a
Master Rigger's License to do such work, and that all work in connection
therewith shall comply with applicable laws and regulations. Any such moving
shall be at the sole risk and hazard of Sublessee, and Sublessee will exonerate,
indemnity and save Sublessor harmless against and from any liability, loss,
injury, claim or suit resulting directly or indirectly from such moving.

14.5 Building Services.   Sublessor shall furnish cleaning of exterior common
- ----------------------
areas, and cleaning of the premises in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit
____ and hot and cold water to the building management services and exterior
grounds maintenance, and exterior repairs. The Sublessor shall install
underground conduits for the Sublessee's telecommunication requirements.

14.6 Electricity. (a) Sublessor shall permit Sublessor's existing wires, pipes,
- ---- ------------
risers, conduits and other electrical equipment of Sublessor to be used for the
purpose of providing electrical service to the Premises. All electrical service
to the premises will be separately metered and paid directly by the Sublessee.
Sublessor, at Sublessor's sole cost and expense, shall cause all electricity
service to the Subleased Premises (other than electricity for HVAC) to be
separately metered. Sublessee covenants and agrees that its electrical usage
will not exceed the maximum load from time to time permitted by applicable
governmental regulations nor the design criteria of the existing Building
electrical capacity. Sublessor shall not in any way be liable or responsible to
Sublessee for any loss or damage or expense which Sublessee may sustain or incur
if, during the Term of this Sublease, either the quantity or character of
electric current is changed or electric current is no longer available or
suitable for Sublessee's requirements due to a factor or cause beyond
Sublessor's control. Sublessee shall purchase and install all lamps, tubes,
bulbs, starters and ballasts in the Premises. Sublessee shall pay all charges
for electricity, HVAC, gas and other utilities used or consumed in the Premises.
After hours HVAC charges to Sublessee shall be at Sublessor's cost, without
markup."After hours" shall mean periods other than 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
weekdays, and 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Saturdays.

(b) In order to insure that the foregoing requirements are not exceeded and to
avert possible adverse affect on the Building's electrical system, Sublessee
shall not, without Sublessor's prior consent, connect any fixtures, appliances
or equipment to the Building's electrical distribution system which operates on
a

                                       33
<PAGE>

voltage in excess of 120 volts nominal. If Sublessor shall consent to the
connection of any such fixtures, appliances or equipment, all additional risers
or other electrical facilities or equipment required therefor shall be provided
by Sublessor and the cost thereof shall be paid by Sublessee upon Sublessor's
demand as Additional Rent. From time to time during the Term of this Sublease,
Sublessor shall have the right to have an electrical consultant selected by
Sublessor make a survey of Sublessee's electric usage, the result of which shall
be conclusive and binding upon Sublessor and Sublessee. In the event that such
survey shows that Sublessee has exceeded the requirements set forth in paragraph
(a), in addition to any other rights Sublessor may have hereunder, Sublessee
shall, upon demand, reimburse Sublessor for the costs of such survey.

14.7.  All work, repairs, alterations or modifications undertaken pursuant to
- ----
this Article 14 shall be subject to the provisions of Article 10 of this
Sublease

DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION
- ---------------------

16.1.  Sublessor's Right of Termination. If the Premises or the building are
- ---------------------------------------
substantially damaged by fire or casualty (the term "substantially damaged"
meaning damage of such a character that the same cannot, in ordinary course
reasonably be expected to be repaired within 6 months from the time the repair
work would commence), then either the Sublessor or the Sublessee may terminate
this Lease by giving notice to the other. in which case this Sublease shall be
deemed terminated 30 days thereafter as if such date were the date originally
established as the expiration date hereof.

16.2.   Restoration. If this Sublease shall not be terminated pursuant to
- ----    ------------
Section 16.1, Sublessor shall thereafter use due diligence to restore the
Premises (including all alterations, additions or improvements made pursuant to
Article 2) to proper condition for Sublessee's use and occupation, provided that
Sublessor's obligation shall be limited to the amount of insurance proceeds
available therefor. If, for any reason, such restoration shall not be
substantially completed within six months after the expiration of the 45 day
period referred to in Section 16.1 (which six-month period may be extended for
such periods of time as Sublessor is prevented from proceeding with or
completing such restoration for any Force Majeure cause as defined under Article
#2 but in no event for more than an additional 45 days), Sublessee shall have
the right to terminate this Sublease by giving notice to Sublessor thereof
within thirty (30) days after the expiration of such period (as so extended).
Upon the giving of such notice, this Sublease shall cease and come to an end
without further liability or obligation on the part of either party unless,
within such 30-day period, Sublessor substantially completes such restoration.
Such right of termination shall be Sublessee's sole and exclusive remedy at law
or in equity for Sublessor's failure so to complete such restoration.

                                       34
<PAGE>

During the period of such restoration, if the Sublessee shall not have
reasonable use and occupancy of the premises, the rent shall be equitably abated
during that period or portion thereof.


ARTICLE 17

EMINENT DOMAIN
- --------------

17.1.  If after the execution of the Sublease and prior to the expiration of the
- -----
term of this Sublease, the whole of the Subleased Premises shall be taken under
the power of eminent domain, then the term of this Sublease shall cease as of
the time when Sublessor shall be divested of its title in the Subleased
Premises, and all rent shall be apportioned and adjusted as of the time of
termination.

17.2.  If only a part of the Subleased Premises shall be taken under the power
- -----
of eminent domain, then if as a result thereof the Subleased Premises shall not
be reasonably adequate for the operation of the business conducted in the
Subleased Premises prior to the taking, Sublessor or Sublessee may, at its
election, terminate the term of this Sublease by giving the other notice of the
exercise of its election within thirty (30) days after it shall receive notice
of such taking, and the termination shall be effective as of the time that
Sublessee is dispossessed, and all rent shall be apportioned and adjusted as of
the time of termination. If only a part of the Subleased Premises shall be taken
under the power of eminent domain, and if the term of this Sublease shall not be
terminated as aforesaid, then the term of this Sublease shall continue in full
force and effect, and Sublessor shall, within a reasonable time after possession
is required for public use, repair and rebuild what may remain of the leased
Premises so as to put the same into condition for use and occupancy by
Sublessee, and a just proportion of all rent according to the nature and extent
of the injury to the Subleased Premises shall be abated for the balance of the
term of this Sublease. All awards attributable to the Sublessee's loss of
leasehold improvements or trade fixtures or other awards directly related to the
Sublessee's business shall be the property of the Sublessee.

17.3.  Sublessor reserves to itself, and Sublessee assigns to Sublessor, all
- -----
rights to damages accruing on account of any taking under the power of eminent
domain or by reason of any act of any public or quasi public authority for which
damages are payable. Sublessee agrees to execute such instruments of assignment
as may be reasonably required by Sublessor in any proceeding for the recovery of
damages that may be recovered in such proceeding. It is agreed and understood,
however, the Sublessor does not reserve to itself, and Sublessee does not assign
to Sublessor, any damages payable for movable trade fixtures installed by
Sublessee or anybody claiming under Sublessee at its own cost and expense, or
any awards attributable to the Sublessee's loss of leasehold improvements or
trade fixtures or other awards directly related to the Sublessee's business
which shall be the property of the Sublessee.

DEFAULT

18.1.  If Sublessee shall default in the payment of rent or other payments
- -----
required of Sublessee, and if Sublessee shall fail to cure said default within
seven (7) business days after receipt of written notice of said default from
Sublessor; or if Sublessee shall default in the performance or observance of any
other agreement or condition on its part to be performed or observed, and if
Sublessee shall fail to cure said default within ninety (90) days or such longer
period as shall be reasonably required so long as the Sublessee shall be
diligently pursuing such cure after receipt of written notice of said default
from Sublessor; or  if any person shall levy upon, or take this leasehold
interest or any part hereof, upon execution, attachment, or their process of
law; or if Sublessee shall make an assignment of its property for the benefit of
creditors; or if Sublessee shall file voluntary bankruptcy; or if any bankruptcy
or insolvency proceedings shall be commenced by Sublessee or an involuntary
bankruptcy shall be filed against the Sublessee which remains undischarged for a
period of 60 days, or if a receiver, trustee, or assignee shall be appointed for
the whole or any part of the Sublessee's property, then in any of said cases,
Sublessor lawfully may upon seven days notice or if such notice shall adversely
affect the rights of the Sublessor in any bankruptcy or receivership, then
immediately, or at any time thereafter, and without further notice of demand,
enter into and upon the Subleased Premises, or any part hereof in the name of
the whole, and hold the Subleased Premises as if this Sublease had not been
made, and expel Sublessee and those claiming under it, and remove its or their
property without being taken or deemed to be guilty of any manner of trespass
(or Sublessor may send written notice to Sublessee of the termination of this
Sublease, and upon entry as aforesaid (or in the event that Sublessor shall sent
to Sublessee notice of termination as above provided, on the fifth (5/th/) day
next following the date of the sending of the notice),  the term of this
Sublease shall terminate.  Sublessee hereby expressly waives any and all rights
of redemption granted by or under any present or future laws in the event of
Sublessee being evicted or dispossessed for any cause, or in the event Sublessor
terminates this Sublease as provided in this Article.  The Sublessee shall be
liable for a 5% interest default rate  applicable to any amounts due under this
Sublease, from the due date of such payment.

18.2.  In case of such termination, Sublessee shall be responsible and liable
- -----
for all rents and payment obligations including those specified below due during
the remaining terms of the Lease which shall be deemed accelerated into a single
payment obligation.  Upon Sublessor's demand for such payment, the Sublessee
shall forward that payment not later than five (5) days after the demand.  Upon
receipt of that payment the Sublessor shall establish an account and deposit the
amount paid into that account.  In the event that the Sublessor shall be able to
re-let the premises, the monthly rental and other payments made by the new

                                       36
<PAGE>

Sublessee shall be credited towards the rents and payment obligations that would
have been due from the original Sublessee on a monthly pro-rata basis. At the
end of the original Sublessee's term the Sublessor shall render an accounting of
all rents and other obligation payments made by the new Sublessee against the
account fund and the Sublessor shall render an accounting and make such
adjustments with the original Sublessee as shall be appropriate.

     In addition to the rents and other obligations of the Sublessee under this
Sublease, the Sublessee shall be liable for any expenses incurred by the
Sublessor in connection with obtaining the premises, or with removing the
property of the Sublessee, with putting the Subleased Premises into a condition
similar to the condition at the commencement of the Sublease, reasonable wear
and tear excepted, and with any reletting, including without limitation any
reasonable attorneys fees and brokers fees.


ARTICLE 19

SUBORDINATION TO MORTGAGES
- --------------------------


     Provided that Sublessor delivers a commercially reasonable Non-Disturbance
Agreement, Sublessee agrees that upon the request of Sublessor it will
subordinate this Sublease and the lien hereof to the lien of any present or
future mortgage or mortgages upon the Subleased Premises, any property of which
the Subleased Premises are a part, or upon any ground lease of such property or
upon any part thereof, irrespective of the time of execution or time of
recording of any sub mortgage or mortgages. Sublessee agrees that it will, upon
the request of Sublessor, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all
instruments deemed by Sublessor necessary or desirable to give effect or notice
of such subordination. The word "mortgage" as used herein includes mortgages,
deeds of trust, or other similar instruments and modifications, consolidations,
extensions, renewals, replacements and substitutes thereof. At the request of
the holder of any mortgage upon the Subleased Premises or any property of which
the Subleased Premises is a part may subordinate the lien of such mortgage to
this Sublease, thereby making this Sublease superior to such mortgage, by
recording in the Rockingham County Registry of Deeds, a Notice of Subordination
or other document of like effect, executed unilaterally by such mortgage.
Whether the lien of any mortgage are a part shall be superior or subordinate to
this Sublease and the lien hereof, Sublessee agrees that , if requested by
Sublessor or the holder of such mortgage, it will attorn to the holder of such
mortgage or anyone claiming under such holder and their respective successors
and assigns in the event of foreclosure of or similar action taken under such
mortgage.

CERTIFICATE

     Within ten (10) business days after written request therefor by Sublessor,
Sublessee agrees to deliver to Sublessor or to any mortgagee a certificate
stating (if such be the case) that Sublessee has entered into occupancy of the
Subleased Premises in accordance with the provisions of this Sublease, that this
Sublease is in full force and effect (if such be the case), that Sublessor has
performed the construction required of Sublessor, and any other information
reasonably requested. Sublessor agrees to provide Sublessee with any similar
certificate upon request by the Sublessee, including a statement that no default
exists under the Primary Sublease, and that the Primary Sublease is in full
force and effect.

ARTICLE 21

ASSIGNMENT, SUBLEASES, MORTGAGE, RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER
- ------------------------------------------------------


21.1.  Assignment.  Sublessee shall not assign this Sublease without the written
- -----  -----------
consent of the Sublessor, provided however, that Sublessee may, without
Sublessor's or the PDA's prior written consent, but upon notice to Sublessor,
sublet all or any portion of the Premises or assign Sublessee's interest in this
lease to: (i) to a subsidiary, affiliate, patent or other entity to Sublessee
which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Sublessee; or
(ii) to a purchaser of 80% of Sublessee's stock or assets or (iii) in connection
with the merger, consolidation or reorganization of Sublessee, provided that
with respect to (ii) and (iii) above such consent shall be given if the
Sublessor shall be provided with financial information adequate to establish
that the Sublessee or such other entity as shall result from any of the events
under ii and iii above, shall have a net worth following the transaction at
least equal to the Sublessee as existed immediately prior to the transaction.

21.2.  Subleases.  Except as provided in 21.1 above, Sublessee shall not
- -----
enter into any sublease of the Subleased Premises without Sublessor's prior
written approval. Any request for Sublessor's approval shall be made at least 21
days prior to the commencement of such tenancy, and shall provide reasonably
detailed information concerning the identity and financial condition of the
proposed sublessee and the terms and conditions of the proposed sublease.
Sublessor shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to such sublease if (1)
the use of the Subleased Premises is a permitted use under this lease; (2) the
sublease is consistent with the terms and conditions of this Sublease; (3)
Sublessee remains primarily liable to Sublessor to pay rent and perform all
other obligations to be performed by Sublessee under this Sublease.

                                       38
<PAGE>

     If Sublessor shall fail to respond to the Sublessee's request within 15
days after receipt of the request, such request shall be deemed approved.

     In the event that the rent for the Subleases Premises shall exceed the per
square foot rent charged to the Sublessee under this lease, Sublessee shall
remit 50% of the excess to Sublessor upon receipt by Sublessee. In calculating
any excess rent payable by Sublessee to Sublessor pursuant to this provision,
Sublessee shall first be entitled to deduct all out of pocket direct expenses
incurred by the sublessee, including but not limited to brokerage and legal
fees, tenant allowances and tenant improvements. Excepting leases to affiliates
and subsidiaries, in no event shall the rent charged by the Sublessee be less
than the 75% of the Market Rent as defined in this Sublease.

     Sublessee shall not employ a broker to market the Subleased Premises or any
portion thereof other than Sublessor's agent The Kane Company, Inc. (or its
successor). This provision shall not apply in the event that 85% of the
ownership interest in the Sublessor shall change, in which event the Sublessor
shall so notify the Sublessee. The foregoing shall not be construed to prevent
Sublessee from procuring subtenants by itself or through non-broker
representatives. Sublessor shall cause The Kane Company, Inc. to use its best
efforts to market the Subleased Premises if called upon under this subparagraph.

21.3 Restrictions on Sublessor's Leasing Activity.
     --------------------------------------------

     (a) Sublessor agrees that it will not execute any lease, sublease or other
agreement for occupancy of all or any portion of the premises demised under the
Primary Sublease (the "Primary Premises") prior to January 15, 2001 without the
prior written consent of Sublessee, which consent may be withheld in Sublessee's
sole and absolute discretion.

     (b) Sublessor and Sublessee agree that Sublessee shall have the option and
right  to sublease additional portions of the Building by providing one or more
written notices to Sublessor designating the portion of the Building which
Sublessee desires to sublease (the "Expansion Space"), provided however that any
such notices shall be given prior to January 15, 2001 ("Option Notices").  In
the event that Sublessee timely delivers an Option Notice, Sublessor and
Sublessee shall promptly execute an amendment to this Sublease with the terms
and conditions described in paragraph (d) below.

     (c) During the period from January 15, 2001 through January 15, 2003 (the
"First Offer Period"), Sublessor shall not lease, sublease or otherwise permit
occupancy of all or any portion of the Primary Premises except in accordance
with this paragraph (c).  If, during the First Offer Period, Sublessor desires
to sublease all or any portion of the Primary Premises, Sublessor shall first
offer to sublease such portion to Sublessee by giving Sublessee written notice
identifying the space which Sublessor desires to sublease (the "Offer Space").
Sublessee shall then have the right, within fifteen (15) days after receiving
Sublessor's notice, to exercise its right to sublease such space by providing
written notice to

                                       39
<PAGE>

Sublessor. If Sublessee so exercises said right, then Sublessor and Sublessee
shall promptly execute an amendment to this Sublease with the terms and
conditions described in paragraph (d) below. If Sublessee does not timely
exercise said right, then Sublessor shall be free for a period of one hundred
eighty (180) days thereafter to sublease the Offer Space to a third party or
parties on such terms as Sublessor deems appropriate. In the event Sublessor has
not executed a sublease with a third party within such one hundred eighty (180)
day period, Sublessee's right of first offer described in this paragraph (c)
shall again apply to the Offer Space.

     (d) In the event Sublessee shall exercise its option rights under paragraph
(b) or paragraph (c) above:

         (1)   The per square foot rental rate shall be the same per square foot
charge paid by the Sublessee under Article 4.1 of this Sublease plus any other
additional charges payable by the Sublessee under this Lease.

         (2)   The Sublessor shall provide the Sublessee an allowance of $27.00
per square foot for Leasehold Improvement Work.

         (3)   Other terms and conditions of the amendment to the Sublease shall
be as negotiated between the parties provided however that the following shall
apply.

         (I)   Sublessor shall promptly prepare plans and specifications for the
work necessary to build out the interior of the Expansion Space or the Offer
Space, as the case may be (the "Expansion Improvement Work"), which plans shall
be subject to Sublessee's approval, not to be unreasonably withheld.

         (II)  After the plans and specifications for the Expansion Improvement
Work have been approved by Sublessee, Sublessor shall prepare a list of all
permits, approvals, consents and licenses (collectively, the "Expansion
Approvals") required for construction of the Expansion Improvement Work, and
shall represent and warrant that the list of Expansion Approvals is complete and
accurate. Thereafter, Sublessor and Sublessee shall promptly and in good faith
agree upon a schedule for the construction of the Expansion Improvement Work
(the "Expansion Schedule"), which schedule shall be substantially in the form of
Exhibit 8 , provided however that a reasonable allowance shall be made for (i)
any delay between the date of this Sublease and the date Sublessee approves the
plans and specifications for the Expansion Improvement Work and (ii) any
difference in scope or nature between the Leasehold Improvement Work and the
Expansion Improvement Work.

         (III) The provisions of Sections 2.3 through 2.7 shall apply to the
construction of the Expansion Improvement Work, provided that (A) all references
in such sections to the "Work" "Base Building Work" or "Leasehold Improvement
Work" shall be deemed to refer to the "Expansion Improvement

                                       40
<PAGE>

Work"; and (B) all references in such sections to the "Term Commencement Date"
shall be deemed to refer to the "Expansion Date" (as hereafter defined).

          (IV) Effective as of the date ("The Expansion Date") which is the
later of the Term Commencement Date or the date on which the Expansion
Improvement Work is Substantially Complete, the Premises shall be amended to
include the Expansion Space or the Offer Space, as the case may be, and the Base
Rent and Sublessee's Proportionate Share shall be amended proportionately.

     (e)  From and after January 15, 2003 through the remainder of the Term of
this Sublease (as the same may be extended) (the "Second Option Period"), Tenant
shall have a continuing right of first offer as follows:

     (f)  Right of First Offer.  Sublessee shall have a continuing right of
          --------------------
first offer to lease all space in the building, (the "Offer Space"), on the
following terms and conditions:

          (1). Prior to offering the Offer Space for lease to third parties,
Sublessor shall first advise Sublessee in writing (the "Offer Notice") of the
terms and conditions upon which Sublessors prepared to lease the Offer Space
(the "Offered Terms").

          (2). Sublessee shall accept or reject the offer made in the Offer
Notice within thirty (30) days after the date of delivery of the Offer Notice
(Sublessee's failure to accept such offer in writing within such thirty (30) day
period shall be deemed an election to reject such offer).

          (3). In the event Sublessee timely accepts the offer set forth in the
Offer Notice, Sublessor and Sublessee shall within fifteen (15) days after the
date of acceptance enter into an amendment to this Lease incorporating the Offer
Space into the Premises on the Offered Terms.

          (4). In the event Sublessee rejects or is deemed to have rejected the
offer set forth in the Offer Notice, Sublessor shall be free for a period of 90
days after the date of rejection or deemed rejections (the "Marketing Period")
to lease the Offer space to a third party or parties on terms not materially
more favorable to such party or parties than the Offered Terms (with respect to
rental rate, "materially" as used herein shall mean a rental rate that is more
than five percent (5%) lower than the rental rate set forth in the Offer
Notice).

     In the event Sublessor has not by expiration of the Marketing Period
executed a lease with a third party complying with the provisions of clause (e)
above, then Sublessee's right of first offer shall again apply to the Offer
Space.  In the event Sublessor executes such a Lease prior to the expiration of
the Marketing Period, Sublessee's right of offer shall not apply to the
applicable Offer Space, until the expiration or earlier termination of such
Lease.

                                       41
<PAGE>

21.4   Continuing Liability of Sublessee.  No subletting, assignment or
- ----   ---------------------------------
transfer, whether Sublessor's consent is required or otherwise given hereunder,
shall release Sublessee's obligations or alter the primary liability of
Sublessee to pay the rent and to perform all other obligations to be performed
by Sublessee hereunder.  The acceptance of rent by Sublessor from any other
person shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Sublessor of any provision hereof.
Consent to one assignment or subletting shall not be deemed consent to any
subsequent assignment or subletting.  If any assignee of Sublessee or any
successor of Sublessee defaults in the performance of any of the terms hereof,
Sublessor may proceed directly against Sublessee without the necessity of
exhausting remedies against such assignee or successor.  If Sublessee assigns
this Sublease, or sublets all or a portion of the Subleased Premises, or
requests the consent of Sublessor to any assignment or subletting, or if
Sublessee requests the consent of Sublessor for any act that Sublessee proposes
to do, then Sublessee shall pay Sublessor's reasonable processing fee and
reimburse Sublessor for all reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection
therewith.  Any assignment or subletting of the Subleased Premises that is not
in compliance with the provisions of this Article XXI shall be void.

21.5   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Sublease, any assignment or

Sublessee shall not have the right to engage in any financing or other
transaction creating any mortgage upon the Subleased Premises.  Any approval of
PDA shall be expressly subject to Condition 21 of the Master Lease and the
provisions of the Primary Sublease.  Sublessee further agrees that in the event
of any authorized sublease or assignment of the Subleased Premises, it shall
provide to the Air Force, EPA and NHDES by certified mail a copy of the
agreement of sublease or assignment of the Subleased Premises within fourteen
(14) days after the effective date of such transaction.  Sublessee may delete
the financial terms and any other proprietary information from any sublease or
assignment submitted to the above mentioned entities.

units against the Air Force, because of any use of, or release from, any portion

22.6.     Sublessor's rights under this Sublease and PDA's rights under the
- -----
Primary Sublease specifically include the right for Sublessor and PDA to inspect
the Subleased Premises and any buildings or other facilities thereon for
compliance with environmental, safety, and occupational health laws and
regulations, whether or not the Sublessor or PDA is responsible for enforcing
them.  Such inspections are without prejudice to the right of duly constituted
enforcement officials to make such inspections. In exercising such rights,
Sublessor shall use diligent efforts to prevent or minimize and to use
reasonable efforts to cause PDA to prevent or minimize interference with
Sublessee's use and enjoyment of the Premises.

22.7.     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Sublease and pursuant to
- -----
the Primary Lease,  PDA is not responsible for any removal or containment of
asbestos.  If Sublessee and any Sublessee or assignee intend to make any
improvements or repairs that require the removal of asbestos, an appropriate
asbestos disposal plan must be incorporated in the plans and specifications.
The asbestos disposal plan shall identify the proposed disposal site for the
asbestos.  In addition, non-friable asbestos which becomes friable through or as
a consequence of the activities of Sublessee will be abated by Sublessee at its

                                       44
<PAGE>

sole cost and expense.  The Sublessor hereby certifies that the leased premises

- -----
identified as a National Priority List (NPL) Site under the Comprehensive

the Pease Federal Facility Agreement ("FFA") entered into by EPA, and the Air
Force on April 24, 1991, and Modification No. 1 thereto, effective March 18,
1993, agrees that it will comply with the terms of the FFA to the extent the
same may be applicable to the Subleased Premises and that should any conflict
arise between the terms of the FFA and the provisions of this Sublease, the
terms of the FFA will take precedence.  The Sublessee further agrees that the
Sublessor and PDA assume no liability to the Sublessee or any Sublessee or
assignee of Sublessee should implementation of the FFA interfere with their use
of the Subleased Premises.  The Sublessee and its Sublessee(s) and assignee(s)
shall have no claim on account of any such interference against the Sublessor,
or PDA or any officer, agent, employee or contractor thereof, other than a claim
to Sublessor for abatement of rent.

22.9.     The Air Force, EPA, and NHDES and their officers, agents, employees,
- -----
contractors, and subcontractors have the right, upon reasonable notice to the
Sublessee and any Sublessee or assignee, to enter upon the Subleased Premises
for the purposes enumerated in this subparagraph and for such other purposes
consistent with the FFA:

               (1)  to conduct investigations and surveys, including, where
     necessary, drilling, testpitting, borings and other activities related to
     the Pease Installation Restoration Program ("IRP") or the FFA;

               (2)  to inspect field activities of the Air Force and its
     contractors and subcontractors in implementing the IRP or the FFA;

               (3)  to conduct any test or survey required by the EPA or NHDES
     relating to the implementation of the FFA or environmental conditions at
     the Subleased Premises or to verify any data submitted to the EPA or NHDES
     by the Air Force relating to such conditions;

               (4)  to construct, operate, maintain or undertake any other
     response or remedial action as required or necessary under the IRP or the
     FFA, including, but not limited to monitoring wells, pumping wells and
     treatment facilities.

22.10.    Sublessee and its sublessees and assignees agree at no cost to them to
- ------
comply with the provisions of any health or safety plan in effect under the IRP
or the FFA during the course of any of the above described response or remedial
actions. Any inspection, survey, investigation, or other response or

                                       45
<PAGE>

remedial action will, to the extent practicable, be coordinated with
representatives designated by the Sublessee and any sublessee or assignee.
Sublessee and any sublessee or assignee shall have no claim on account of such
entries against the State as defined in FFA or any officer, agent, employee,
contractor, or subcontractor thereof.

activities under the Sublease.

22.12.    Any permit required under Hazardous Substance Laws for the management
- ------
of Hazardous Substances stored or generated by Sublessee or any sublessee or
assignee of Sublessee shall be obtained by Sublessee or its sublessees or
assignee and shall be limited to generation and transportation.  Any violation
of this requirement shall be deemed a material breach of this Sublease.
Sublessee shall provide at its own expense such hazardous waste storage
facilities, complying with all laws and regulations, as it needs for management
of its hazardous waste.

22.13.    Sublessee, and any Sublessee or assignee of Sublessee whose operations
- ------
utilize Hazardous Substances,  shall have a completed and approved plan for
responding to Hazardous Substances spills prior to commencement of operations on
the Subleased Premises.  Such plan shall be independent of, but not inconsistent
with, any plan or other standard of PDA applicable to the Airport and except for
initial fire response and/or spill containment, shall not rely on use of the
Airport or Sublessor personnel or equipment. Except as permitted in the Primary
Sublease, Sublessor agrees that no such plan will be required as long as the
Subleased Premises are used for office and ancillary purposes not utilizing
Hazardous Substances, except in the amounts, and in the manner customarily used
for office and ancillary purposes, Should the Sublessor provide any personnel or
equipment, whether for initial fire response and/or spill containment or
otherwise, on request of the Sublessee, or because the Sublessee was not, in the
reasonable opinion of Sublessor, conducting timely cleanup actions, the
Sublessee agrees to reimburse the Sublessor for its costs.

22.14.    Sublessee, and any Sublessee or assignee of Sublessee, must maintain
- ------
and make available to PDA, the Air Force, EPA and NHDES all records, inspections
logs, and manifests that tract the generation, handling, storage, treatment and
disposal of Hazardous Waste, as well as all other records required by applicable
laws and requirements. PDA and the Air Force reserve the right to inspect the
Subleased Premises and Sublessee's, its sublessee's or assignee's records for
compliance with Federal, State, local laws, regulations, and other requirements
relating to the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of
hazardous waste, as well as the discharge or release of hazardous substances.
Violations may be reported by PDA and the Air Force to appropriate

                                       46
<PAGE>

regulatory agencies, as required by applicable law. The Sublessee, its
Sublessees or assignees shall be liable for the payment of any fines and
penalties or costs which may accrue to the United States of America or PDA as a
result of the actions of Sublessee, its Sublessees or assignees, respectively.

22.15     Sublessor hereby represents and warrants to Sublessee that to the best
of its knowledge and belief the property is free from contamination by Hazardous
Materials or Hazardous Substances and complies with all environmental laws.
Sublessor represents and warrants to Sublessee that Sublessor has delivered to
Sublessee all environmental site assessments and similar reports known to
Sublessor affecting the Property.  Sublessor agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold Sublessee harmless from all loss, cost, damage, claims or expenses incurred
by Sublessor as result of the inaccuracy of the above representations.

22.16     Notwithstanding any provisions of this Sublease to the contrary,
Sublessor shall be solely responsible for maintaining and operating the
emergency generator to be installed as part  of the Base Building Work (the
costs of such maintenance and operation to be reimbursed by Sublessee) and,
accordingly, all risk and responsibility for handling, storing and disposing of
fuel for the generator, and all other environmental risks associated with the
generator, shall be borne by the Sublessor.

HOLDING OVER

     Holding Over. Any holding over by Sublessee after the expiration of the

Term of this Sublease shall be treated as a daily tenancy at sufferance at a
rate equal to the then fair rental value of the Subleased Premises but in no
event less than 150% the sum of (i) Base Rent and (ii) Operating Expenses and
real estate taxes in effect on the expiration date provided that during the
first 6 months of such holdover the rate shall be at 120% of the then Base Rent

over as an extension of the Term of this Sublease for a period of up to the
first 6 months, at 120% of the then current rent rate, such extension to be on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Section.

ARTICLE 24

WAIVERS
- -------


     Failure of Sublessor to complain of any act or omission on the part of
Sublessee, no matter how long the same may continue, shall not be deemed to be a
waiver by Sublessor of any of its rights hereunder.  No waiver by Sublessor at
any time, express or implied, or any breach of any provision of this Sublease
shall be deemed a waiver of a breach of any other provision of this Sublease or
a consent of any subsequent breach of the same or any other provision.  If any
action by Sublessee shall require Sublessor's consent or approval, Sublessor's
consent to or approval of such action on any one occasion shall not be deemed a
consent to or approval of said action on any subsequent occasion or a consent to
or approval of any other action on the same or any subsequent occasion.  No
payment by Sublessee or acceptance by Sublessor of a lesser amount than shall be
due from Sublessee to Sublessor shall be deemed to be anything but payment on
account, and the acceptance by Sublessor of a check for a lesser amount with an
endorsement or statement thereon, or upon letter accompanying said check that
said lesser amount is payment in full, shall not be deemed an accord and
satisfaction, and Sublessor may accept said check without prejudice to recover
the balance due or pursue any other remedy.  Any and all rights and remedies
which Sublessor may have under this Sublease or by operation of law, either at
law or in equity, upon any breach, shall be distinct, separate and cumulative,
and shall not be deemed inconsistent with each other; and no one of them,
whether exercised by Sublessor or not, shall be deemed to be in exclusion of any
other; and any two or more of all such rights and remedies may be exercised at
the same time.

alternative dispute resolution, provisions hereof in good faith, the aggrieved
party may then commence litigation.

apply in the event that either party reasonably requires immediate ex parte

person or group of persons, on account of race, color, creed, national origin,
or ancestry, in the leasing, subleasing, transferring, use, occupancy, tenure,
or enjoyment of the Premises herein leased nor shall the Sublessee, or any
person claiming under or through it, establish or permit any such practice or
practices of discrimination or segregation with reference to the selection,
location, number, use, or occupancy, of tenants, lessees, Sublessees,
subtenants, or vendees in the Subleased Premises herein leased.

30.7.     All obligations of Sublessee to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
- -----
Sublessor, PDA and the Air Force and to make any monetary payment to Sublessor,
PDA and the Air Force shall survive the termination or expiration of this
Sublease.

30.8.     Sublessor's Liability.  (a)  With respect to any services or utilities
- -----     ----------------------
to be furnished by Sublessor to Sublessee, Sublessor shall in no event be liable
for failure to furnish the same when prevented from doing so by force, major
strike, lockout, breakdown, accident, order or regulation of or by any
governmental authority, or failure of supply, or inability by the exercise of
reasonable diligence to obtain supplies, parts or employees necessary to furnish
such services, or because of war or other emergency, or for any cause beyond
Sublessor's

                                       52
<PAGE>

reasonable control, or for any cause due to any act or neglect of Sublessee or
Sublessee's servants, agents, employees, licensees or any person claiming by,
through or under Sublessee; nor shall any such failure give rise to any claim in
Sublessee's favor that Sublessee has been evicted, either constructively or
actually, partially or wholly.

(b)  In no event shall Sublessor ever be liable to Sublessee for any loss of
business or any other indirect or consequential damages suffered by Sublessee
from whatever cause.

(c)  With respect to any repairs or restoration which are required or permitted
to be made by Sublessor, the same may be made during normal business hours and
Sublessor shall have no liability for damages to Sublessee for inconvenience,
annoyance or interruption of business arising therefrom.

(d)   An "Abatement Event" shall be defined as an event or circumstance (other
than those addressed in Articles 16 and 17 or by reason of some other event or
circumstance beyond the control of the Sublessor, that prevents Sublessee from
using the Premises or any portion thereof, as a result of any failure to provide
services or access to the Premises.  Sublessee shall give Sublessor notice
("Abatement Notice") of any such Abatement Event, and if such Abatement Event
continues beyond the "eligibility Period" as that term is defined below), then
the Base Rent and Sublessee's other monetary obligations to Sublessor shall be
abated entirely or reduced, as the case may be, after expiration of the
Eligibility Period for such time that Sublessee continues to be so prevented
from using, and does not use, the Premises or a portion thereof, in the
proportion that the rentable area of the portion of the Premises that Sublessee
is prevented from using, and does not use, bears to the total rentable area of
the Premises; provided, however, in the event that Sublessee is prevented from
using, and does not use, a portion of the premises for a period of time in
excess of the Eligibility Period and the remaining portion of the Premises is no
sufficient to allow Sublessee to effectively conduct its business therein, and
if Sublessee does not conduct its business from such remaining portion, then for
such time after expiration of the Eligibility Period during which Sublessee is
so prevented from effectively conducting its business therein, Base Rent and
Sublessee's other monetary obligations to Sublessor shall be abated entirely for
such time as Sublessee continues to be so prevented from using, and does not
use, the Premises.  The term "Eligibility period" shall mean a period of three
(3) consecutive days after Sublessor's receipt of any Abatement Notice(s).  In
addition, if an Abatement Event continues for thirty (30) consecutive days after
any Abatement Notice, Sublessee may terminate this sublease by written notice to
Sublessor at any time prior to the date such Abatement Event is cured by
Sublessor.


30.9.     Additional Charges. If Sublessee shall fail to pay when due any sums
- -----     -------------------
under this Sublease designated or payable as an additional charge, Sublessor
shall have the same rights and remedies as Sublessor has hereunder for failure
to pay Base Rent.

                                       53
<PAGE>

30.10.    Brokerage. The parties agree that the Kane Company and CRF Partners,

responsible for all brokerage fees.

- ------    -----------
management fees which are estimated at $.40 per square foot for the first year
of the Lease.  Such fees shall be payable monthly.


30.12     Primary Sublease, Master Lease, Application, Acceptance and FFA.
          -----------------------------------------------------------------

Sublessor shall perform the Base Building Work and Leasehold Improvement Work in
accordance with all provisions of the Primary Sublease, Master Lease,
Application, Acceptance and FFA (collectively, the "Documents") and all other
applicable laws, and requirements, and shall during the Term operate the
premises leased under the Primary Sublease in accordance with the Documents and
all other applicable laws, codes and requirements.  Sublessor shall deliver to
Sublessee copies of all correspondence sent or received by Sublessor to or from
any party to any of the Documents alleging a default by any party thereto or
otherwise setting forth matters which might reasonably be expected to have an
adverse impact on the leasehold interest created by this Sublease or on
Sublessee's use and enjoyment of the Subleased Premises.

30.13     Notice of Lease.  The parties shall executed and record a Notice of
- -----                       -------------------------------------------------
Lease in the form required under New Hampshire law.
- ---------------------------------------------------

39.14     Sublessor Default and Sublessee Self-Help.   Sublessor shall be deemed
- -----     --------------------------------------------
to be in default of this Lease if Sublessor fails to make any payments to
Sublessee required under this Sublease and such failure continues for ten (10)
days after written notice from Sublessee to Sublessor, or if Sublessor shall be
in default in the prompt and full performance of any other of its promises,
covenants, or agreements contained in this Sublease and such default in
performance continues for more than thirty (30) days after written notice
thereof from Sublessee to Sublessor specifying the particulars of such default
or breach of performance; provided, however, that if the default complained of,
other than for the payment of monies, is of such a nature that the same cannot
be rectified or cured within such thirty (30) day period, then such default
shall be deemed to be rectified or cured if Sublessor, within such thirty (30)
day period, shall have commenced such cure and shall continue thereafter with
due diligence to cause such cure to be completed.  Upon any default of this
Sublease by Sublessor, Sublessee shall be entitled to pursue any and all
remedies available to Sublessee at law or in equity, including, without
limitation, the right of self-help, to be exercised as follows:  following the
occurrence of a Sublessor default not cured within the cure period provided
above, Sublessee may notify Sublessor in writing of sublessee's intent to
exercise its self-help remedy set forth in this Section 30.14; in the event
Sublessor fails to cure the default within ten (10) days after delivery of such
notice, Subtenant shall have the right, but not the

                                       54
<PAGE>

obligation, to cure such default itself, and the costs incurred by Sublessee in
curing such default shall be offset against the Base Rent next coming due until
satisfied in full.

2.  If Sublessor reasonably objects in writing to any curtains, blinds, shades,
    screens or hanging plants or other similar objects attached to or used in
    connection with any window or door of the Premises, or placed on any
    windowsill, which is visible from the exterior of the Premises, Sublessee
    shall immediately discontinue such use. Sublessee shall not place anything
    against or near glass partitions or doors or windows, which may appear
    unsightly from outside the Premises.

3.  Sublessee shall not obstruct any sidewalks, halls, passages, exits,
    entrances, elevators, escalators or stairways of the Project. The halls,
    passages, exits, entrances, shopping malls, elevators, escalators and
    stairways are not open to the general public, but are open, subject to
    reasonable regulations, to Sublessee's business invitees. Sublessor shall in
    all cases retain the right to control and prevent access thereto of all
    persons whose presence in the judgment of Sublessor would be prejudicial to
    the safety, character, reputation and interest of the Project and its
    Sublessees: provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed to
    prevent such access to persons with whom any Sublessee normally deals in the
    ordinary course of its business, unless such persons are engaged in illegal
    or unlawful activities.

    be provided exclusively through Sublessor, and except with the written
    consent of Sublessor, no person or persons other than those approved by
    Sublessor shall be employed by Sublessee or permitted to enter the Project
    for the purpose of cleaning the same. Sublessee shall not cause any
    unnecessary labor by carelessness or indifference to the good order and
    cleanliness of the Premises.

6.   Sublessor will furnish Sublessee, free of charge, with two keys to each
     door lock in the Premises. Sublessor may make reasonable charge for any
     additional keys. Sublessee shall not make or have made additional keys, and
     Sublessee shall not alter any lock or install a new additional lock or bolt
     on any door of its Premises without Sublessor's consent not to be
     unreasonably withheld. Sublessee, upon the termination of its tenancy,

     to Sublessee, and in the event of loss of any keys so furnished, shall pay
     Sublessor therefor.

     building, subject to such reasonable scheduling as Sublessor, in its

     building or carried in the elevators except between such hours and in such
     elevators as may be designated by Sublessor. Sublessee initial move in and
     subsequent deliveries of bulky items, such as furniture, safes and similar
     items shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Sublessor, be made
     during the hours of 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. or on Saturday or Sunday. No
     deliveries shall be made which impede or interfere with other Sublessees or
     the operation of the building.

9.   Sublessee shall not place a load upon any floor of the Premises, which
     exceeds the load per square foot, which such floor was designed to carry
     and which is allowed by law. Sublessor shall have the right to prescribe
     the weight, size and position of all equipment; materials, furniture or
     other property brought into the building. Heavy objects shall, if necessary
     by Sublessor, stand on such platforms as determined by Sublessor to be
     necessary to properly distribute the weight, which platforms shall be
     provided at Sublessee's expense. Business machines and mechanical equipment
     belonging to Sublessee, which cause noise or vibration that may be
     transmitted to the structure of the building or to any space therein to
     such a degree as to be objectionable to Sublessor or to any Sublessees in
     the building, shall be placed and maintained by Sublessee, at Sublessee's
     expense, on vibration eliminators or other devices sufficient to eliminate
     noise or vibration. The persons employed to move such equipment in or out
     of the building must be acceptable to Sublessor. Sublessor will not be
     responsible for loss of, or damage to, any such equipment or other property
     from any cause, and all damage done to the building by maintaining or
     moving such equipment or other property shall be repaired at the expense of
     Sublessee.

10.  Sublessee shall not use or keep in the Premises any kerosene, gasoline or
     inflammable or combustible fluid or material other than those limited

     quantities necessary for the operation or maintenance of office equipment.
     Sublessee shall not use or permit to be used in the Premises any foul or
     noxious gas or substance, or permit or allow the Premises to be occupied or
     used in a manner offensive or objectionable to Sublessor or other occupants
     of the building by reason of noise, odors or vibrations, nor shall
     Sublessee bring into or keep in or about the Premises any birds or animals.

11.  Sublessee shall not use any method of heating or air conditioning other
     than that supplied by Sublessor.

12.  Sublessee shall not waste electricity, water or air conditioning and shall

     the most effective operation of the building's heating and air conditioning
     and to comply with any governmental energy-saving rules, laws or
     regulations of which Sublessee has actual notice, and shall refrain from
     attempting to adjust controls. Sublessee shall keep corridor doors closed,
     and shall close window coverings at the end of each business day. Sublessee

     holidays, any person unless that person is known to the person or employee
     in charge of the building and has a pass or is properly identified.
     Sublessee shall be responsible for all persons for whom it requests passes
     and shall be liable to Sublessor for all acts of such persons. Sublessor
     shall not be liable for damages for any error with regard to the admission
     to or exclusion from the building of any person. Sublessor reserves the
     right to prevent access to the building in case of invasion, mob, riot,
     public excitement or other commotion by closing the doors or by other
     appropriate action.

15.  Sublessee shall close and lock the doors of its Premises and entirely shut
     off all water faucets or other apparatus, and electricity, gas or air
     outlets before Sublessee and its employees leave the Premises. Sublessee
     shall be responsible for any damage or injuries sustained by other
     Sublessees or occupants of the building or by Sublessor for noncompliance
     with this rule.

16.  The toilet rooms, toilets, urinals, wash bowls and other apparatus shall
     not be used for any purpose other than that for which they were constructed

     the Sublessees of the Project.

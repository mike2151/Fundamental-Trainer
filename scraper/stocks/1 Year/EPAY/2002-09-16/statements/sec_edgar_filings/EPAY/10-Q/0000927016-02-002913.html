         Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
                                 March 31, 2002


Note 1 - Basis of Presentation

     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to
Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all
of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals and
adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim
financial information have been included. Operating results for the three and
nine months ended March 31, 2002 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002. For further
information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes included in the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC).

     Certain amounts have been reclassified to comply with recent accounting
pronouncements as more fully disclosed in Note 9.


Note 2 - Business Combinations

     The Company acquired the stock of two companies, Checkpoint Holdings, Ltd.
(Bottomline Europe) and Flashpoint, Inc. (Flashpoint) on August 28, 2000. These
acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases. Accordingly, the accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of
operations and the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed from the respective date of acquisition.

     The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the
combined results of operations of the Company, Bottomline Europe and Flashpoint
as if the acquisitions had occurred as of the beginning of the nine months ended
March 31, 2001, after giving effect to certain adjustments, including
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets. The pro forma information
does not necessarily reflect the results of operations that would have occurred
had the Company, Bottomline Europe and Flashpoint been a single entity for such
entire period.

Note 3 - Financing Arrangements

    The Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (Credit Facility),
dated December 28, 2001, providing for borrowings of up to $5 million. Eligible
borrowings are based on a borrowing base calculation of the Company's eligible
accounts receivable as defined in the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the
Credit Facility bear interest at the bank's prime rate (4.75% at March 31, 2002)
plus one-half of one percent and are due on December 28, 2002, the expiration
date of the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by
substantially all U.S. owned assets of the Company. The Company is subject to
certain financial covenants as outlined in the Credit Facility. The Credit
Facility also provides for the issuance of up to $2 million in letters of credit
for, and on behalf of the Company. The borrowing capacity under the Credit
Facility is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At March 31, 2002, a
$2 million letter of credit has been issued to the Company's landlord as part of
a lease amendment for a new corporate headquarters. There were no outstanding
borrowings under the Credit Facility at March 31, 2002.

    The Company's subsidiary, Bottomline Europe, entered into a Committed
Overdraft Facility (Overdraft Facility), dated December 18, 2001, providing for
borrowings of up to 2 million British Pound Sterling. Borrowings under this
Overdraft Facility bear interest at the bank's base rate (4% at March 31, 2002)
plus 2% and are due on December 31, 2002, the expiration date of the Overdraft
Facility. Borrowings under this Overdraft Facility are secured by substantially
all assets of Bottomline Europe. There were no outstanding borrowings under the
Overdraft Facility at March 31, 2002.


Note 4 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

    In October 2001, the Company entered into a lease amendment for its new
headquarters facility. In connection with the amendment, the Company reduced the
amount of space leased from approximately 83,000 square feet to approximately
65,000 square feet and delayed occupancy until May 2002. In connection with the
lease amendment, the Company's bank issued a $2 million letter of credit to the
Company's landlord under the Company's Credit Facility (see Note 3). Also in
connection with the lease amendment, the Company issued to the landlord 100,000
shares of common stock and a warrant, valued using the Black-Scholes method, to
purchase an additional 100,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$4.25 per share. The warrant, which expires in October 2004, was fully vested
and exercisable upon issuance. The fair value of the common stock and warrant
issued, $750,000, was capitalized and will be amortized as rent expense over the
term of the lease.


Note 5 - Net Loss Per Share

     The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net
loss per share:

     The effect of outstanding stock options and warrants are excluded from the
calculation of diluted net loss per share for the three and nine months ended
March 31, 2002 and 2001, as their effect would be anti-dilutive.


Note 6 - Comprehensive Loss

     Comprehensive loss represents net loss plus the results of certain
stockholders' equity changes not reflected in the unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of operations. The components of comprehensive loss, net
of tax, are as follows:

Note 7 - Operations by Industry Segments and Geographic Area

     The Company is a global technology provider of financial software solutions
that are sold to businesses and financial institutions. As permitted by the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131,
"Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information", the
Company has one reportable segment for financial statement purposes.

     Prior to the acquisition of Bottomline Europe on August 28, 2000, the
Company did not have material operations outside the United States. Net sales,
based on the point of sales, not the location of the customer, are as follows:

Note 8 - Income Taxes

    In the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2002, the Company
incurred a substantial operating loss due primarily to the amortization of
intangible assets. Since amortization expense will continue to be incurred for
tax purposes, even after the adoption of SFAS 142, and the Company has utilized
its income tax loss carryback, the Company has determined that its deferred tax
assets are less likely, rather than more likely, to be realized. Accordingly,
the Company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax
assets as of March 31, 2002.

    On March 7, 2002, there was a change in the U.S. federal tax law to allow
companies to carryback, for an additional three-year period, net operating
losses for the tax years ending 2001 and 2002. As a result of this change, the
Company expects to realize approximately $895,000 in federal tax refunds.
Accordingly, this amount is included as a component of our other current assets
at March 31, 2002. As this amount of additional carryback opportunity relates
entirely to the tax benefit associated with the exercise of non-qualified stock
options, the tax carryback benefit has been recorded entirely as an increase to
additional paid-in capital.


Note 9 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements

    In September 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues
Task Force (EITF) published its consensus on EITF No. 00-10, "Accounting for
Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs", which required that all shipping and
handling amounts billed to a customer be classified as revenue. The Company
adopted EITF 00-10 effective April 1, 2001. Prior to adoption, the Company had
recorded such amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. Financial statements for
prior periods presented for comparative purposes have been reclassified to
comply with the classification guidelines of EITF 00-10.

    In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS
No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. These standards, among other things, eliminate the pooling of interests
method of accounting for future acquisitions and require that goodwill no longer
be amortized, but instead be subject to impairment testing on at least an annual
basis. SFAS No. 141 is effective for all business combinations completed after
June 30, 2001.

   SFAS No. 142 must be adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001 (fiscal 2003 for the Company). Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142,
intangible assets with definite useful lives will be amortized to their
estimable residual values over those estimated useful lives in proportion to the
economic benefits consumed. Such intangible assets are subject to the impairment
provisions of SFAS No. 144 (discussed below). Goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives will be tested for impairment annually, or more
frequently when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be
impaired, in lieu of being amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired
prior to July 1, 2001 will continue to be amortized until adoption of SFAS No.
142. Upon adoption, the Company is required to perform a transitional impairment
test on all indefinite lived intangible assets. To the extent that an impairment
charge is required, it will be treated as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle.

   The Company is in the process of determining the impact of SFAS 142 and
expects to complete its analysis, including the transitional impairment test,
during the first quarter of fiscal year 2003. Amounts that were previously
capitalized and treated as the separate intangible asset "assembled workforce"
will be reclassified to goodwill, since under SFAS 142 amounts paid relative to
assembled workforce do not meet the requirements of an intangible asset that can
be separately stated. Upon adoption, the Company will cease its annual
amortization of goodwill and any amounts reclassified to goodwill. The Company's
current annual amortization of goodwill and assembled workforce is approximately
$26 million. The Company currently plans to adopt SFAS No. 142 effective July 1,
2002 (fiscal year 2003).

      In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. " SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No.
121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of" and provides a single accounting model for the
disposal of long-lived assets. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 144 for
the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2001 (fiscal year 2003) and does
not believe it will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial
statements.

   In November 2001, FASB issued Staff Announcement Topic No. D-103, "Income
Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for "Out-of-Pocket"
Expenses Incurred", which requires that all out-of-pocket expenses billed to a
customer be classified as revenue with the offsetting cost recorded as costs of
revenue. Out of pocket expenses generally include, but are not limited to,
expenses related to airfare, mileage, hotel stays and out-of town meals. The
Company has previously treated reimbursement for such expense as a reduction to
cost of sales, and has reclassified such amounts to revenue upon adoption,
effective January 1, 2002. The adoption of FASB Staff Announcement Topic No.
D-103 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
statements.


Note 10 - Stockholders' Equity

   In January 2002, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with
funds affiliated with General Atlantic Partners, LLC ("General Atlantic"), a
global private equity investment firm, whereby the Company issued 2.1 million
shares of common stock at $8.25 per share generating gross proceeds of $17.3
million to the Company.

     During the quarter the Company accepted as payment, for an existing
customer contract, 124,200 shares of the Company's common stock. This customer
had purchased approximately 308,000 shares of the Company's common stock in June
of 2000, for $10 million in cash, which represented the fair value of the common
stock at the time. The shares accepted by the Company are included as a
component of treasury stock at March 31, 2002.


Note 11 - Subsequent Events

   On May 10, 2002, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with
eVelocity Corporation (eVelocity). eVelocity provides an electronic billing
service for corporate legal departments to receive bills from outside law firms.
The purchase price, inclusive of liabilities assumed, is approximately $3
million in cash plus acquisition costs.

permitted by the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 131, "Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related

Results of Operations

Three Months Ended March 31, 2002 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2001

Revenues

  Total revenues decreased by $1.2 million to $18.0 million in the three months
ended March 31, 2002 from $19.2 million in the three months ended March 31,
2001, a decrease of 6%. The decrease in total revenues was due primarily to
the current economic conditions and reduced capital spending by our customers
and potential customers. Revenues, based on the point of sales, rather than the
location of the customer, were $10.9 million and $7.1 million in the United
States and United Kingdom, respectively, for the three months ended March 31,
2002. Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2001 were $11.4 million and
$7.8 million in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively.

  Software Licenses. Software license revenues decreased by $1.4 million to $4.3
million in the three months ended March 31, 2002 from $5.7 million in the three
months ended March 31, 2001, a decrease of 25%. Software license revenues
represented 24% of total revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2002
compared to 30% of total revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2001. The
decrease in software license revenues was due primarily to the current economic
conditions and reduced capital spending by our customers and potential
customers. Based on current product plans, we anticipate software license
revenues, as a percentage of total revenues, will continue at levels consistent
with or above the third quarter during the remainder of the fiscal year.

  Service and Maintenance. Service and maintenance revenues increased by
approximately $800,000 to $9.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2002
from $8.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2001, an increase of 10%.
Service and maintenance revenues represented 50% of total revenues in the three
months ended March 31, 2002 compared to 43% of total revenues in the three
months ended March 31, 2001. The increase in service and maintenance revenues in
the quarter was primarily the result of the recognition of a minimum revenue
guarantee of $811,000 from one of our customers. Due to the nature of this
minimum guarantee, we would not expect this type of revenue stream to reoccur in
subsequent quarters. However, based on current product plans, we anticipate
service and maintenance revenue dollars will continue at levels consistent with
the third quarter during the remainder of the fiscal year.

  Equipment and Supplies. Equipment and supplies revenues decreased by
approximately $500,000 to $4.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2002
from $5.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2001, a decrease of 11%.
Equipment and supplies sales represented 26% of total revenues in the three
months ended March 31, 2002 compared to 27% of total revenues in the three
months ended March 31, 2001. Based on current product plans, we anticipate
equipment and supplies revenue dollars will not change significantly during the
remainder of the fiscal year.

Cost of Revenues

  Software Licenses. Software license costs decreased by $831,000 to $294,000
in the three months ended March 31, 2002 from $1.1 million in the three months
ended March 31, 2001. Software license costs were 7% of software license
revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2002 compared to 20% of software
license revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2001. Software license
costs for the three months ended March 31, 2001 reflected the write-down of
third-party software acquired for resale and held in our inventory. There were
no similar costs present for the three months ended March 31, 2002. We
anticipate software license costs, as a percentage of software license revenues,
will not change significantly during the remainder of the fiscal year.

                                      10

<PAGE>

  Service and Maintenance. Service and maintenance costs decreased by
approximately $700,000 to $4.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2002
from $4.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2001, a decrease of 14%.
Service and maintenance costs were 45% of service and maintenance revenues in
the three months ended March 31, 2002 compared to 58% of service and maintenance
revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2001. In the three months ended
March 31, 2002, we recognized revenues of $811,000 associated with a customer's
minimum revenue guarantee, which had minimal cost associated therewith, thus
improving our margins in the current period. We anticipate service and
maintenance costs, as a percentage of service and maintenance revenues, will
return to historical levels for the remainder of the fiscal year.

  Equipment and Supplies. Equipment and supplies costs decreased by
approximately $500,000 to $3.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2002
from $3.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2001, a decrease of 12%.
Equipment and supplies costs were 73% of equipment and supplies revenues in the
three months ended March 31, 2002 compared to 74% of equipment and supplies
revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2001. The decrease in equipment and
supplies costs was attributable to the associated decrease in equipment and
supplies revenues. We anticipate equipment and supplies costs, as a percentage
of equipment and supplies revenues, will not change significantly during the
remainder of the fiscal year.

Operating Expenses

Sales and Marketing:

     Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales
commissions, travel, public relations and marketing materials and trade shows.
Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $1.6 million to $4.7 million in the
three months ended March 31, 2002 from $6.3 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2001, a decrease of 24%. Sales and marketing expenses were 26% of
total revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2002 compared to 33% of total
revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2001. The dollar decrease was due
primarily to cost reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.
We anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase during the
remainder of the fiscal year.

Product Development and Engineering:

  Product Development and Engineering. Product development and engineering
expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development.
Core development efforts continue to be focused on enhancements and revisions to
our suite of products based on customer feedback and marketplace demands. In the
future, we expect to release enhancements to each of our principal products.
Product development and engineering expenses decreased by approximately $800,000
to $3.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2002 from $4.1 million in
the three months ended March 31, 2001, a decrease of 20%. Product development
and engineering expenses were 18% of total revenues in the three months ended
March 31, 2002 compared to 21% of total revenues in the three months ended March
31, 2001. The dollar decrease was due primarily to cost reductions implemented
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. We believe that product development and
engineering costs, as a percentage of revenues, will increase in the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year due to the addition of development employees as the
result of our acquisition of eVelocity in May 2002, which is more fully
described in Note 11 of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements.

     Stock Compensation Expense. In connection with our acquisition of
Flashpoint in August 2000, we assumed all of the outstanding common stock
options of Flashpoint, which were exchanged for our common stock options, and
recorded deferred compensation of $1.3 million at the date of acquisition
relating to the intrinsic value of the unvested options. The deferred
compensation is being amortized to expense over the remaining vesting period of
the options. Stock compensation expense decreased by $7,000 to approximately
$103,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2002 from $110,000 in the three
months ended March 31, 2001, a decrease of 6%. We believe that the stock
compensation expense will not change significantly during the remainder of the
fiscal year.

                                      11

<PAGE>

General and Administrative:

  General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance
employees and legal and accounting services. General and administrative expenses
decreased by approximately $800,000 to $2.8 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2002 from $3.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2001, a
decrease of 23%. General and administrative expenses were 15% of total revenues
in the three months ended March 31, 2002 compared to 19% of total revenues in
the three months ended March 31, 2001. The dollar decrease was due primarily to
cost reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. We anticipate
that general and administrative expenses will not change significantly during
the remainder of the fiscal year.

  Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets
related to our acquisitions decreased by approximately $500,000 to $8.3 million
in the three months ended March 31, 2002 from $8.8 million in the three months
ended March 31, 2001. We expect to incur a consistent amount of such
amortization expense during the remainder of the fiscal year. In July 2001, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This standard,
among other things, requires that goodwill no longer be amortized, but instead
be subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis. The Company is in
the process of determining the impact of SFAS 142 and expects to complete its
analysis, including a transitional impairment test, during the first quarter of
fiscal year 2003. Upon adoption on July 1, 2002, the Company will cease its
annual amortization of goodwill and of any amounts reclassified to goodwill. The
Company's current annual amortization of goodwill and intangible assets which
will be reclassified to goodwill is approximately $26 million.

Other Income (Expense), Net:

  Other income (expense), net consists of interest income less interest and
other expense. Other income (expense), net increased by $444,000 to other
income, net of $46,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2002 from other
expense, net of $398,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2001. The other
expense in the prior fiscal year was due to interest on promissory notes issued
in connection with the acquisition of Bottomline Europe, which were retired in
the quarter ended June 30, 2001. We expect to generate a slight increase in
other income during the remainder of the fiscal year as a result of additional
interest income earned on the proceeds of our equity transaction with General
Atlantic described in Note 10 of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements.

Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes:

  The provision for income taxes was approximately $113,000 in the three
months ended March 31, 2002 compared with a benefit for income taxes of
approximately $499,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2001. At March 31,
2002, the provision for income taxes consisted of a small amount of U.S. state
tax expense, which will be incurred irrespective of our net operating loss
position, and tax expense associated with the activities of Bottomline Europe,
which files a statutory tax return under the tax jurisdiction of the United
Kingdom. At March 31, 2002, exclusive of the refundable tax amount more fully
described in Note 8 of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements, we had utilized our income tax carryback benefit and, accordingly,
had maintained a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets since
they are less likely, rather than more likely, to be realized.


 Nine Months Ended March 31, 2002 Compared to Nine Months Ended March 31, 2001

Revenues

  Total revenues decreased by approximately $1.7 million to $56.5 million in the
nine months ended March 31, 2002 from $58.2 million in the nine months ended
March 31, 2001, a decrease of 3%. The decrease was due primarily to the current
economic conditions and reduced capital spending by our customers and potential
customers, offset by a full nine months of revenues contribution from Bottomline
Europe. Revenues, based on the point of sales, rather than the location of the
customer, were $34.8 million and $21.7 million in the United States and United
Kingdom, respectively, for the nine months ended March 31, 2002. Revenues for
the nine months

                                      12

<PAGE>

ended March 31, 2001 were $39.3 million and $18.9 million in the United States
and United Kingdom, respectively.

  Software Licenses. Software license revenues decreased by $6.5 million to
$12.5 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2002 from $19.0 million in the
nine months ended March 31, 2001, a decrease of 34%. Software license revenues
represented 22% of total revenues in the nine months ended March 31, 2002
compared to 33% of total revenues in the nine months ended March 31, 2001. The
decrease in software license revenues was due primarily to the current economic
conditions and reduced capital spending by our customers and potential
customers, offset by a full nine months of revenues contribution from Bottomline
Europe.

  Service and Maintenance. Service and maintenance revenues increased by $4.1
million to $28.7 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2002 from $24.6
million in the nine months ended March 31, 2001, an increase of 17%. Service and
maintenance revenues represented 51% of total revenues in the nine months ended
March 31, 2002 compared to 42% of total revenues in the nine months ended March
31, 2001. The increase in service and maintenance revenues was due primarily to
a full nine months of revenues contribution from Bottomline Europe and several
large service contracts from our installed customer base.

  Equipment and Supplies. Equipment and supplies revenues increased by
approximately $700,000 to $15.3 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2002
from $14.6 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2001, an increase of 5%.
Equipment and supplies revenues represented 27% of total revenues in the nine
months ended March 31, 2002 compared to 25% of total revenues in the nine months
ended March 31, 2001. The increase in equipment and supplies revenues was due
primarily to a full nine months of revenues contribution from Bottomline Europe
and several large equipment orders during the period.

Cost of Revenues

  Software Licenses. Software license costs decreased by approximately $800,000
to approximately $900,000 in the nine months ended March 31, 2002 from $1.7
million in the nine months ended March 31, 2001. Software license costs were 8%
of software license revenues in the nine months ended March 31, 2002 compared to
9% of software license revenues in the nine months ended March 31, 2001.
Software license costs for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 reflected the
write-down of third-party software acquired for resale and held in our
inventory. The decrease in software license costs in the period was due to the
absence of inventory write-down costs, offset by increases in royalties due to
third parties on the sale of certain of our software products.

  Service and Maintenance. Service and maintenance costs increased by
approximately $600,000 to $14.0 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2002
from $13.4 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2001, an increase of 4%.
Service and maintenance costs were 49% of service and maintenance revenues in
the nine months ended March 31, 2002 compared to 54% of service and maintenance
revenues in the nine months ended March 31, 2001. The dollar increase in service
and maintenance costs was primarily due to a full nine months of Bottomline
Europe operations.

  Equipment and Supplies. Equipment and supplies costs increased by
approximately $600,000 to $11.1 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2002
from $10.5 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2001, an increase of 6%.
Equipment and supplies costs were 73% of equipment and supplies revenues in the
nine months ended March 31, 2002 compared to 72% of equipment and supplies
revenues in the nine months ended March 31, 2001. Equipment and supplies costs
increased primarily due to a full nine months of Bottomline Europe operations.

Operating Expenses

 Sales and Marketing:

    Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales
commissions, travel, public relations and marketing materials and trade shows.
Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $4.4 million to $14.2 million in the
nine months ended March 31, 2002 from $18.6 million in the nine months ended
March 31, 2001, a decrease of 23%. Sales and marketing expenses were 25% of
total

                                      13

<PAGE>

revenues in the nine months ended March 31, 2002 compared to 32% of total
revenues in the nine months ended March 31, 2001. The dollar decrease was due
primarily to cost reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001,
partially offset by a full nine months of sales and marketing expenses from our
Bottomline Europe and Flashpoint acquisitions.

Product Development and Engineering:

     Product Development and Engineering. Product development and engineering
expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development.
Core development efforts continue to be focused on enhancements and revisions to
our suite of products based on customer feedback and marketplace demands. In the
future, we expect to release enhancements to each of our principal products.
Product development and engineering expenses decreased by approximately $200,000
to $10.4 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2002 from $10.6 million in
the nine months ended March 31, 2001, a decrease of 2%. Product development and
engineering expenses remained level at 18% of total revenues in the nine months
ended March 31, 2002 and March 31, 2001. The dollar decrease was due primarily
to cost reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 offset by a
full nine months of product development and engineering expenses from our
Flashpoint and Bottomline Europe acquisitions.

     Stock Compensation Expense. In connection with our acquisition of
Flashpoint in August 2000, we assumed all of the outstanding common stock
options of Flashpoint, which were exchanged for our common stock options, and
recorded deferred compensation of $1.3 million at the date of acquisition
relating to the intrinsic value of the unvested options. The deferred
compensation is being amortized to expense over the remaining vesting period of
the options. Stock compensation expense increased by $51,000 to $307,000 in the
nine months ended March 31, 2002 from $256,000 in the nine months ended March
31, 2001, an increase of 20%. The increase was due to a full nine months of
stock compensation expense recorded in the current fiscal year.

General and Administrative:

     General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance
employees and legal and accounting services. General and administrative expenses
decreased by approximately $1.4 million to $8.6 million in the nine months ended
March 31, 2002 from $10.0 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2001, a
decrease of 14%. General and administrative expenses were 15% of total revenues
in the nine months ended March 31, 2002 compared to 17% of total revenues in the
nine months ended March 31, 2001. The dollar decrease was due primarily to cost
reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, offset by a full
nine months of general and administrative expenses from our Bottomline Europe
and Flashpoint acquisitions.

     Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets
related to our acquisitions increased by $4.2 million to $25.0 million in the
nine months ended March 31, 2002 from $20.8 million in the nine months ended
March 31, 2001. The increase was due to a full nine months of amortization
expense, associated with the acquisitions of Bottomline Europe and Flashpoint,
recorded in the current fiscal year.

Other Expense, Net:

    Other expense, net consists of interest income less interest and other
expense. Other expense, net decreased by $243,000 to other expense, net of
$208,000 in the nine months ended March 31, 2002 from $451,000 in the nine
months ended March 31, 2001. The expense in the prior fiscal year was due to
interest on promissory notes issued in connection with the acquisition of
Bottomline Europe, which were retired in the quarter ended June 30, 2001. The
expense in the current fiscal year was due primarily to a $450,000 write down
due to impairment of an equity investment, offset by interest income. The
investment was in a non-public entity, accounted for under the cost method, in
which indicators of impairment became present during the period resulting in a
decline in investment value that the Company judged to be other than temporary.
After the write down, the carrying value of this investment is $450,000.

Provision for Income Taxes:

     The provision for income taxes was approximately $203,000 in the nine
months ended March 31, 2002 compared with $1.4 million in the nine months ended
March 31, 2001. At March 31, 2002, the provision for income taxes consisted of a
small amount of U.S. state tax expense, which will be incurred irrespective of
our net operating loss position, and tax expense associated with the activities
of Bottomline Europe, which files a statutory tax return under the tax
jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. At March 31, 2002, exclusive of the
refundable tax amount described in Note 8 of our unaudited condensed financial
statements, we had utilized our income tax loss carryback benefit and,
accordingly, had maintained a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax
assets since they are less likely, rather than more likely, to be realized.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

    We have financed our operations primarily from cash provided by the sale of
our common stock and operating activities. We had net working capital of $27.7
million at March 31, 2002, which included cash and cash equivalents totaling
$29.8 million.

    In January 2002, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with funds
affiliated with General Atlantic Partners, LLC, a global private equity
investment firm, whereby we issued 2.1 million shares of common stock at $8.25
per share generating gross proceeds of $17.3 million to us.

    In December 2001, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (Credit
Facility), providing for borrowings of up to $5 million. Eligible borrowings are
based on a borrowing base calculation of our eligible accounts receivable as
defined in the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear
interest at the bank's prime rate (4.75% at March 31, 2002) plus one-half of one
percent and are due on December 28, 2002, the expiration date of the Credit
Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all
U.S. owned assets. We are subject to certain financial covenants as outlined in
the Credit Facility. At March 31, 2002 we were in compliance with all financial
covenants outlined in the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility also provides for
the issuance of up to $2 million in letters of credit for, and on behalf of us.
The borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility is reduced by any outstanding
letters of credit. At March 31, 2002, a $2 million letter of credit has been
issued to our landlord as part of a lease amendment for a new corporate
headquarters. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility at
March 31, 2002.

    In December 2001, our subsidiary, Bottomline Europe, entered into a
Committed Overdraft Facility (Overdraft Facility), providing for borrowings of
up to 2 million British Pound Sterling. Borrowings under this Overdraft Facility
bear interest at the bank's base rate (4% at March 31, 2002) plus 2% and are due
on December 31, 2002, the expiration date of the Overdraft Facility. Borrowings
under this Overdraft Facility are secured by substantially all assets of
Bottomline Europe. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Overdraft
Facility at March 31, 2002.

    In August 2000, we entered into a ten-year lease for approximately 83,000
square feet of space for a new headquarters facility in Portsmouth, New
Hampshire. In October 2001, we entered into a lease amendment for the new
headquarters facility. In connection with the amendment, we reduced the amount
of space leased from approximately 83,000 square feet to approximately 65,000
square feet and delayed occupancy to May 2002. Total lease payments for this new
facility, which we anticipate will commence with occupancy in May 2002, will be
approximately $11.7 million. In connection with the lease amendment, we issued
a $2 million letter of credit to the landlord under our Credit Facility. Also in
connection with the lease amendment, we issued to the landlord 100,000 shares of
our common stock and a warrant, valued using the Black-Scholes method, to
purchase an additional 100,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$4.25 per share. The warrant, which expires in October 2004, was fully vested
and exercisable upon issuance. The fair value of the common stock and warrant
issued, $750,000, was capitalized and will be amortized as rent expense over the
term of the lease.

    Cash provided by operating activities was $2.6 million in the nine months
ended March 31, 2002 and cash used in operating activities was $2.6 million in
the nine months ended March 31, 2001. Net cash provided by operating activities
for the nine months ended March 31, 2002 was

                                      15

<PAGE>

the result of decreases in accounts receivable and other current assets and
increases in deferred revenue, offset by the net loss and decreases in accounts
payable and accrued expenses.

    Net cash used in investing activities was $1.8 million in the nine months
ended March 31, 2002 and $7.5 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2001.
Cash was used in the nine months ended March 31, 2002 primarily to acquire
property and equipment associated with the move to our new headquarters
facility.

    Net cash provided by financing activities was $15.7 million in the nine
months ended March 31, 2002 and cash used in financing activities was $8.6
million in the nine months ended March 31, 2001. Net cash provided by financing
activities was the result of the issuance of common stock to General Atlantic
Partners, LLC and net proceeds from the issuance of stock pursuant to our
employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock
under our two stock repurchase programs, approved by the Board of Directors on
September 17, 2001 and February 21, 2002.

     We have no long-term debt or capital lease obligations. We lease our
headquarters facilities located in Portsmouth, New Hampshire under a lease which
expires in June 2002. We will be relocating to a new headquarters facility in
May 2002 and, as such, have entered into a non-cancelable operating lease for
the new facility, which is also located in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In
addition to the 10 year base term of the new lease, the Company has the option
to extend the term by two five-year periods. Rent payments are fixed for the
term of the lease, including increases each year. The Company is also obligated
to pay specific incremental operating expenses over the base rent. The lease
obligation is scheduled to begin in conjunction with occupancy in May 2002. We
also lease facilities in San Francisco, California; New York, New York;
Lakewood, Colorado; Great Neck, New York and Boston, Massachusetts. We own our
office space in Reading, England and have leased facilities in Reading, London,
and Leeds, England; Belfast, Ireland; and Glasgow, Scotland.

     In addition, we have various operating leases for office equipment and
vehicles. Our lease obligations for facilities, office equipment and vehicles
for the next year, years 2 through 3, years 4 through 5, and greater than 5
years are $2.4 million, $3.8 million, $3.4 million and $8.1 million,
respectively.

    We anticipate additional capital expenditures related to the relocation of
our headquarters facility will not exceed $1 million. The Company expects to
incur normal capital expenditure obligations in the upcoming fiscal year.

    We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to
meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. We
also may receive additional investments from, and make investments in other
companies.


                 CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

     Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should
carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before making an
investment decision involving our common stock. The risks and uncertainties
described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and
uncertainties may also impair our business operations. If any of the following
risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations
would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could
fall, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common
stock.

The slowdown in the economy has affected the market for information technology
solutions, including our products and services, and our future financial results
will depend, in part, upon whether this slowdown continues

     As a result of unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending
by our customers and potential customers, demand for our products and services
has been adversely affected. This has resulted in decreased revenues and a
decline in our growth rate. Our future results will be materially and adversely
affected if this slowdown continues and our revenues continue to be adversely
impacted. In connection with the economic slowdown, we previously implemented
several cost reduction initiatives in order to improve our profitability. If
current

                                      16

<PAGE>

economic conditions continue or worsen, these cost reductions may prove to be
inadequate and we may experience a material adverse impact on our business,
operating results, and financial condition.

Our common stock has experienced and may continue to undergo extreme market
price and volume fluctuations

    Stock markets in general, and the Nasdaq Stock Market in particular, have
experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, especially in recent years.
Broad market fluctuations of this type may adversely affect the market price of
our common stock. The stock prices for many companies in the technology sector
have experienced wide fluctuations that often have been unrelated to their
operating performance. The market price of our common stock has experienced, and
may continue to undergo extreme fluctuations due to a variety of factors,
including:

    .    general and industry-specific business, economic and market conditions;

    .    actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results, including as a
         result of any impairment of goodwill related to our past acquisitions;

    .    changes in or our failure to meet, analysts' or investors' estimates or
         expectations;

    .    public announcements concerning us, including announcements of
         litigation, our competitors or our industry;

    .    introductions of new products or services or announcements of
         significant contracts by us or our competitors;

    .    acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital
         commitments by us or our competitors;

    .    adverse developments in patent or other proprietary rights; and

    .    announcements of technological innovations by our competitors.

Our fixed costs may lead to operating results below external expectations if our
revenues are below anticipated levels, causing the market price of our common
stock to fall

     A significant percentage of our expenses, particularly personnel and
facilities costs, are relatively fixed and based in part on anticipated revenue
levels. We have undergone, and are currently experiencing, slowing growth rates
due to the economic slowdown. A decline in the growth rate of revenues without a
corresponding and timely slowdown in expense growth could negatively affect our
business. Significant revenue shortfalls in any quarter may cause significant
declines in operating results since we may be unable to reduce spending in a
timely manner.

    Quarterly operating results that are below the expectations of public market
analysts could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. Factors
that could cause these fluctuations include the following:

    .    economic conditions which may affect our customers' and potential
         customers' budgets for information technology expenditures;

    .    the timing of orders and longer sales cycles, particularly due to the
         increased average sales price of our software solutions;

    .    the timing of product implementations, which are highly dependent on
         customers' resources and discretion;

    .    the incurrence of costs relating to the integration of software
         products and operations in connection with acquisitions of technologies
         or businesses;

                                      17

<PAGE>

    .    the timing and market acceptance of new products or product
         enhancements by either us or our competitors; and

    .    delivery interruptions relating to equipment and supplies purchased
         from third-party vendors.

     Because of these factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of
our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful.

As a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded a significant amount of
intangible assets that may adversely affect our future operating results.

   As of March 31, 2002, we had unamortized goodwill and intangible assets of
$47.1 million from prior acquisitions. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which requires that goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but
instead be tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when events or
circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. We currently
plan to adopt SFAS No. 142 effective July 1, 2002 (fiscal year 2003). Any future
write-off of goodwill or intangible assets could be significant and would likely
have an adverse impact on our reported operating results.

We face risks associated with our international operations that could harm our
financial condition and results of operations

     In recent periods, a significant percentage of our revenues has been
generated by our international operations, and our future growth rates and
success are in part dependent on continued growth and success in international
markets. As is the case with most international operations, the success and
profitability of our international operations are subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties that include, in addition to the risks our business as a whole
faces, the following:

    .    difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;

    .    differing regulatory and industry standards and certification
         requirements;

    .    the complexities of foreign tax jurisdictions;

    .    reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;

    .    currency exchange rate fluctuations; and

    .    import or export licensing requirements.


A significant percentage of our revenues to date have come from our payment
management offerings and our performance will depend on continued market
acceptance of these solutions

     A significant percentage of our revenues to date have come from the license
and maintenance of our payment management offerings and sales of associated
products and services. Any significant reduction in demand for our payment
management offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operating results and financial condition. Our future performance could depend
on the following factors:

    .    continued market acceptance of our payment management offerings as a
         payment management solution;

    .    prospective customers' dependence upon enterprises seeking to enhance
         their payment functions to integrate electronic payment capabilities;

                                      18

<PAGE>

    .    our ability to introduce enhancements to meet the market's evolving
         needs for secure payments and cash management solutions; and

    .    continued acceptance of desktop and enterprise software, and laser
         check printing solutions.

Our future financial results will depend upon the acceptance of our electronic
invoice presentment product offerings in an emerging market

    The electronic invoice presentment business model is in the early stages of
market adoption, even though the product has been generally available by us, and
our competitors for some time. The market for this product may not be ready to
adopt our electronic invoice presentment business model, or may be slower to
adopt the model than we, or the public market analysts anticipate. If this
emerging market does not adopt our business model or does not respond as quickly
as we expect, our future results could be materially and adversely affected.

Our success depends on the widespread adoption of the Internet and growth of
electronic business

     Our future success will in large part depend upon the willingness of
businesses and financial institutions to adopt the Internet as a medium of
e-business. These entities will probably accept this medium only if the Internet
provides substantially greater efficiency and enhances their competitiveness.
There are critical issues involved in the commercial use of the Internet that
are not yet fully resolved, including concerns regarding the Internet's
security, reliability, ease of access and quality of service.

     To the extent that any of these issues inhibit or limit the adoption of the
Internet as a medium of e-commerce, our business prospects could be adversely
affected. If electronic business does not continue to grow or grows more slowly
than expected, demand for our products and services may be reduced.

We face significant competition in our targeted markets, including from
companies with significantly greater resources

   In recent years we have encountered increasing competition in our targeted
markets. We compete with a wide range of companies, ranging from small start-up
enterprises with limited resources, which compete principally on the basis of
technology features or specific customer relationships, to large companies,
which can leverage off significant customer bases and financial resources. Given
the size and nature of our targeted markets, the implementation of our growth
strategy and our success in competing for market share generally may be
dependent on our ability to grow our sales and marketing capabilities and
maintain a critical level of financial resources. If we are unable to do so, we
could lose market share to competitors.

Integration of acquisitions or strategic investments could interrupt our
business and our financial condition could be harmed

     We have made several acquisitions of companies in the past and may, in the
future, acquire or make investments in other businesses, products or
technologies. Any acquisitions or strategic investments we have made in the past
or may make in the future may entail numerous risks that include the following:

    .    entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience or
         knowledge;

    .    difficulties integrating acquired operations, personnel, technologies
         or products;

    .    diversion of management's focus from our core business concerns;

    .    write-offs related to impairment of goodwill and other intangible
         assets;

    .    exposure to litigation from stockholders or creditors of, or other
         parties affiliated with, the target company or companies;

    .    dilution to existing stockholders and earnings per share; and

    .    incurrence of substantial debt.

                                      19

<PAGE>

     Any such difficulties encountered as a result of any mergers, acquisitions
or strategic investments could adversely affect our business, operating results
and financial condition.

We depend on key employees who are skilled in e-commerce, payment, cash
management and invoice presentment methodology and Internet and other
technologies

    Our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers
and key technical employees who are skilled in e-commerce, payment methodology
and regulation, and Internet, database and network technologies. The loss of one
or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our
business. We currently do not maintain "key man" life insurance policies on any
of our employees. While some of our executive officers have employment
agreements with us, the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or
other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operating results and financial condition.

We must attract and retain highly skilled personnel with knowledge in
e-commerce, payment, cash management and invoice presentment methodology and
Internet and other technologies

     We are dependent upon the ability to attract, hire, train and retain highly
skilled technical, sales and marketing, and support personnel, particularly with
expertise in e-commerce, payment, cash management and invoice methodology and
Internet and other technologies. Competition for qualified personnel is intense.
As a result we may experience increased compensation costs that may not be
offset through either improved productivity or higher sales prices. There can be
no assurances that we will be successful in attracting, continuously recruiting
and in retaining existing personnel. Based on our experience, it takes an
average of nine months for a salesperson to become fully productive. We cannot
assure you that we will be successful in increasing the productivity of our
sales personnel, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect
on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Our mix of products and services could have a significant affect on our
financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our stock

    Our products and services have considerably varied gross margins. Software
margins in general yield significantly higher gross margins than do our service,
maintenance, equipment and supplies revenue streams. If the mix of our products
and services in any given period do not match our expectations, our results of
operations and the market price of our stock could be significantly impacted.

An increasing number of large and more complex customer contracts may impact the
timing of our revenue recognition and affect our operating results, financial
condition and the market price of our stock

    Due to an increasing number of large and more complex customer contracts, we
have experienced, and will continue to experience, delays in the timing of our
revenue recognition. These large and complex customer contracts generally
require significant implementation work, product customization and modification
resulting in the recognition of revenue on a percentage of completion basis.
Delays in revenue recognition on these contracts could affect our operating
results, financial condition and the market price of our stock.

Increased competition may result in price reductions and decreased demand for
our product solutions

     The payments and electronic invoice presentment software markets in which
we compete are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological
change. Some competitors in our targeted markets have longer operating
histories, significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources,
greater brand recognition and a larger installed customer base than we do. We
expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging
companies enter the markets for payment and electronic invoice presentment
software solutions. In addition, current and potential competitors may make
strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships to expand their
product offerings and to offer more comprehensive solutions. This growing
competition may result in price reductions of our products and services, reduced
revenues and

                                      20

<PAGE>

gross margins and loss of market share, any one of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Our success depends on our ability to develop new and enhanced software,
services and related products

     The payments and electronic invoice presentment software markets in which
we compete are subject to rapid technological change and our success is
dependent on our ability to develop new and enhanced software, services and
related products that meet evolving market needs. Trends that could have a
critical impact on us include:

    .   rapidly changing technology, which could cause our software to become
        suddenly outdated or could require us to make our products compatible
        with new database or network systems;

    .   evolving industry standards, mandates and laws, such as those mandated
        by the National Automated Clearing House Association and the Association
        for Payment Clearing Services; and

    .   developments and changes relating to the Internet that we must address
        as we maintain existing products and introduce any new products.

     There can be no assurance that technological advances will not cause our
technology to become obsolete or uneconomical. If we are unable to develop and
introduce new products, or enhancements to existing products, in a timely and
successful manner, our business, operating results and financial condition could
be materially adversely affected.

Any unanticipated performance problems or bugs in our product offerings could
have a material adverse effect on our future financial results

    If the products that we offer do not continue to achieve market acceptance,
our future financial results will be adversely affected. Since many of our
software solutions are still in early stages of adoption, any unanticipated
performance problems or bugs that we have not been able to detect could result
in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from
our other development efforts, negative publicity regarding us and our products,
harm to our customer relationships and exposure to potential liability claims.
In addition, if these products do not enjoy wide commercial success, our
long-term business strategy will be adversely affected which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition.

We could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our proprietary
technology and could be subject to litigation regarding our intellectual
property rights, causing serious harm to our business

     We rely upon a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws and
non-disclosure and other intellectual property contractual arrangements to
protect our proprietary rights. However, we cannot assure you that our patents,
pending applications for patents that may be issued in the future, or other
intellectual property will be of sufficient scope and strength to provide
meaningful protection of our technology or any commercial advantage to us, or
that the patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We enter
into agreements with our employees and customers that seek to limit and protect
the distribution of proprietary information. Despite our efforts to safeguard
and maintain our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that such rights
will remain protected or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and
take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.

     In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States
involving patents and other intellectual property rights. We may be a party to
litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property rights or as a
result of an alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of others.
These claims could require us to spend significant sums in litigation, pay
damages, delay product installments, develop non-infringing intellectual
property or acquire

                                      21

<PAGE>

licenses to intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claim.
These claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition.

We may incur significant costs from class action litigation as a result of
expected volatility in our common stock

      In the past, companies that have experienced market price volatility of
their stock have been the targets of securities class action litigation. In
August 2001, we were named as a party in one of the so-called "laddering"
securities class action suits relating to the underwriting of our initial public
offering. We could incur substantial costs and experience a diversion of our
management's attention and resources in connection with such litigation, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Our future financial results will depend on our ability to manage growth
effectively

     In the past, rapid growth has strained our managerial and other resources.
Our ability to manage any future growth, should it occur, will depend in part on
our ability to continue to enhance our operating, financial and management
information systems. We cannot assure you that our personnel, systems and
controls will be adequate to support any future growth. If we are unable to
manage growth effectively, should it occur, the quality of our services, our
ability to retain key personnel and our business, operating results and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Problems with third-party hardware that we resell could adversely affect our
business

     Any problems with third-party hardware that we resell could harm our
customer relationships, industry credibility and financial condition. In a prior
fiscal year, we experienced a significant problem with a third-party printer
that we were then reselling which had a material adverse effect on our operating
results. Any repetition of these or similar problems with third party hardware
could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and
financial condition.


PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

      On July 25, 2001, an action was filed against BancBoston Robertson
Stephens, an underwriter of our initial public offering, in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint in the
action did not name us, or any of our officers or directors, and asserted claims
against the underwriter similar to those asserted in the Cyrek action described
below.

      On August 10, 2001, a class action complaint was filed against us in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York: Paul Cyrek
v. Bottomline Technologies, Inc.; Daniel M. McGurl; Robert A. Eberle;
Fleetboston Robertson Stephens, Inc.; Deutsche Banc Alex Brown Inc.; CIBC World
Markets; and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. The complaint filed in the action asserted
claims similar to those described below.

     On April 20, 2002, a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed
against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York: In re Bottomline Technologies Inc. Initial Public Offering Securities
Litigation. The complaint supersedes the class action complaint filed against us
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on
August 10, 2001: Paul Cyrek v. Bottomline Technologies, Inc.; Daniel M. McGurl;
Robert A. Eberle; Fleetboston Robertson Stephens, Inc.; Deutsche Banc Alex Brown
Inc.; CIBC World Markets; and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., as well as three
additional actions initially filed against BancBoston Robertson Stephens, an
underwriter of our initial public offering, for which the complaints did not
name us, or any of our officers or directors. The complaint filed in the action
asserts claims under Sections 11, 12(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. The complaint asserts, among other things, that the description in our
prospectus for our initial public offering was materially false and misleading
in describing the compensation to be earned by the underwriters of our offering,
and in not describing certain alleged arrangements among underwriters and
initial purchasers of our common stock from the underwriters. The complaint
seeks damages (or, in the alternative, tender of the plaintiffs' and the class's
Bottomline common stock and rescission of their purchases of our common stock
purchased in the initial public offering), costs, attorneys' fees, experts' fees
and other expenses. We intend to vigorously defend ourself against this
complaint. While this proceeding is in its early stages, we do not currently
believe that the outcome will have a material adverse impact on our financial
condition. Other than the filing of the consolidated amended class action
complaint, there have been no material developments in this litigation since it
first became a reportable event.

Sales of Unregistered Securities

     In January 2002, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with
funds affiliated with General Atlantic, a global private equity investment firm.
General Atlantic paid $22.3 million for 2.7 million shares, 2.1 million of which
were newly issued shares sold by the Company generating gross proceeds of $17.3
million to the Company. The balance of the shares were sold in equal amounts by
two directors who were the cofounders of the Company, one of whom is the chief
executive officer. Pursuant to the terms of the transaction, the Company entered
into a registration rights agreement dated January 15, 2002 with General
Atlantic and a partner designee of General Atlantic joined the Company's board
of directors. The closing date of this transaction was January 15, 2002. These
securities were offered and issued pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

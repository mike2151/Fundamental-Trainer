             NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
                              FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note A - Basis of Presentation
- ------------------------------
    The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q
and therefore do not include all of the information and footnotes required by
generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.
These interim statements should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes thereto included or incorporated by reference in the
GenCorp Inc. (Company) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
November 30, 1994.

    All normal recurring accruals and adjustments considered necessary for a
fair presentation of the unaudited results for the six months ended May 31,
1995 and 1994, have been reflected.  The results of operations for the six
months ended May 31, 1995, are not necessarily indicative, if annualized, of
those to be expected for the full fiscal year.

    Certain reclassifications have been made to conform prior year's data to 
the current presentation.

Note B - Accounting Changes
- ---------------------------
    Effective December 1, 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 106 "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS 106), SFAS
No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109) and SFAS No. 112 "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" (SFAS 112).

    SFAS 106 requires that the expected cost of providing postretirement health
care and life insurance benefits be charged to expense during the years that
the employees render service.  Prior to 1994, the Company expensed the cost of
these benefits for continuing operations as they were paid.  Upon
implementation of the standard, the Company elected immediate recognition of
the transition obligation by taking a one-time charge against earnings.

    SFAS 109 requires the use of the liability method in accounting for income
taxes.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be
in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.  Prior to the adoption
of SFAS 109, income tax expense was determined using the deferred tax method
required by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11 - "Accounting For Income
Taxes" (APB 11).

    SFAS 112 requires the use of the accrual method of accounting for benefits
payable to employees that leave the Company other than by reason of retirement.
Implementation of this standard had an immaterial impact as most of these
benefits were accounted for in accordance with SFAS 112 prior to December 1,
1993.

    The table below shows the components of the cumulative effect of the above
three accounting changes:

</TABLE>



Note C - Net Income Per Share of Common Stock
- ---------------------------------------------
    Primary earnings per share of common stock are calculated by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted for
the inclusion of stock options.  For fully diluted earnings per share, net
income and shares outstanding have also been adjusted as if the Company's
$115,000,000 8% Convertible Subordinated Debentures Due August 1, 2002 had been
converted.  (See Note F for further information regarding the debentures.)

Note D - Accounts Receivable
- ----------------------------
    In June 1994, the Company extended its receivable financing program through
December 1994.  Under the agreement, new receivables were sold as collections
reduced previously sold receivables.  Accounts receivable as shown in the
Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet are net of $60 million for 1994
representing the interests in receivables sold under this agreement.  When this
program expired on December 31, 1994, the Company used its existing borrowing
capacity to repurchase outstanding receivables previously sold under this
agreement.

Note E - Inventories
- --------------------
    Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value.  A portion of
the inventories is priced by use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method using
various dollar value pools.  Interim LIFO determinations may involve
management's judgments of expected year-end inventory levels.  Components of
inventory are as follows:

Note F - Long-term Debt and Credit Lines
- -----------------------------------------
   In April 1992, the Company converted all previously outstanding revolving
loans into a three-year $450 million unsecured revolving credit facility
(Facility).  In March 1995, banks with commitments totaling $445 million
extended the maturity date of the Facility until April 1997, which is the last
extension available under the Facility.  As of May 31, 1995, unused revolving
lines of credit totaled $165 million.  The Company pays commitment fees of 3/8
of one percent on the unused balance.  Interest rates are variable, primarily
based on LIBOR, and are currently at an average rate of 7.18 percent.

     The Facility contains various debt restrictions and provisions relating to
net worth and interest coverage ratios.  The Company is required to maintain
consolidated net worth of not less than $243 million, excluding the impact of
the new accounting standards and the unusual items recorded in the fourth
quarter of 1994 pursuant to an amendment to the Facility.  Excluding the impact
of these items, the Company had net worth of $293 million at May 31, 1995 and
was in compliance with the amended agreement.

     The Company had interest rate swap agreements covering a notional amount
of $75 million, which expired in June 1995.  The semi-annual settlement rates
for these agreements were calculated as a spread between a fixed annual rate of
9.54 percent and the six-month floating LIBOR rate.

     The $115,000,000 8% Convertible Subordinated Debentures Due August 1, 2002
(Debentures) are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part,
at any time on or after August 10, 1996.  The Debentures are convertible at any
time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, into shares of common stock
at a conversion price of $16.065 per share (equivalent to a conversion rate of
approximately 62.247 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of
Debentures) subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.  The market value
of the Debentures was $124 million at May 31, 1995.

     At May 31, 1995, the Company had unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit
with several banks for short-term borrowings aggregating $41 million, of which
$9 million was outstanding.  Borrowings under such lines generally bear
interest at money market rates and are payable on demand.  The Company also had
outstanding letters of credit totaling $29 million at May 31, 1995.

Environmental Matters
- ----------------------
Sacramento, California

     In June 1989, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
California approved entry of a Partial Consent Decree (Decree) which partially
settled environmental litigation initiated against Aerojet and its inactive
subsidiary, Cordova Chemical Company, by the State of California and the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a result of the release of
chemicals at Aerojet's Sacramento, California facility prior to 1980.





                                      -8-
<PAGE>   9
Note G - Contingencies and Uncertainties (continued)
- ----------------------------------------------------
     The Decree requires Aerojet to conduct a Remedial
Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) of the Sacramento site and prepare an
RI/FS report on specific environmental conditions present at the site and
alternatives available to remedy such conditions.  The Decree does not require
Aerojet to perform final remedial measures at the site.  Additionally, Aerojet
is required to pay for certain costs associated with ongoing government
oversight of Aerojet's compliance with the Decree.

     In September 1993, Aerojet reached a settlement with the United States
government on its claim to recover a portion of environmental remediation costs
incurred after June 1989.   Aerojet recovered approximately $18 million under
this settlement for costs incurred from July 1989 through November 1992.  The
settlement also provides that 65 percent of covered costs incurred after
November 1992, net of insurance recoveries, will be added to the pricing of
government contracts.  As a part of the settlement, Aerojet agreed to release
its claim under the "Superfund" law against the United States in federal
district court for recovery of costs covered by the settlement.

     Aerojet has substantially completed its site characterization efforts
under the Decree to determine the nature and extent of contamination at the
Sacramento facility and has identified the remediation technologies that will
likely be deployed to remedy such contamination.  During the fourth quarter of
1994, Aerojet completed its estimate of remediation costs at its Sacramento
facility and based on currently available facts, existing technology and
presently enacted laws and regulations, recorded a net $68 million charge.
These remediation costs are principally for design, construction and
enhancement of groundwater and soil treatment facilities, ongoing project
management and regulatory oversight, and are expected to be incurred over a
period of approximately 20 years.  This estimate will be subject to changes as
work progresses and additional experience is gained.

     At May 31, 1995, Aerojet had a reserve of $208 million for costs to
complete the RI/FS and remediate the site and has recognized $122 million for
probable future recoveries under existing settlement agreements with the United
States government.

     Legal proceedings to obtain reimbursements of environmental costs from
insurers are continuing; however, Aerojet presently cannot estimate the
recovery that may be obtained under any policy.

Lawrence, Massachusetts

     The Company has completed a study of remediation alternatives for its
closed Lawrence, Massachusetts facility, which was contaminated with PCBs and
other contaminants, and has begun site remediation and off-site disposal of
debris.  The Company has a reserve of $31 million for the decontamination and
the long-term operating and maintenance costs of this site.  The reserve
represents the Company's best estimate for the remaining remediation cost.  The
study indicated that the future remediation cost could range as high as $56
million depending on the results of future testing and the ultimate remediation
alternatives undertaken at the site.  The time frame for remediation is
currently estimated to range from 5 to 9 years.

Note G - Contingencies and Uncertainties (continued)
- ----------------------------------------------------
Muskegon, Michigan

     Aerojet and its two inactive Cordova Chemical subsidiaries (Cordova) have
been involved in litigation regarding a former Cordova facility in Muskegon,
Michigan where the EPA has conducted an RI/FS under the Superfund law.  The
United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan previously
ruled that Aerojet and Cordova were liable under the superfund law with a
former owner/operator of the facility for remediation at the site.  Separately,
the State of Michigan Court of Claims previously ruled that the State of
Michigan is obligated to indemnify Cordova for remediation costs which it
incurs at the site.

     These rulings have been appealed to the Sixth Circuit United States Court
of Appeals and the Michigan Court of Appeals, respectively.  Aerojet and
Cordova expect to prevail on these appeals.  On a related matter, in May 1993
the EPA terminated, without resolution, two orders issued in 1990 and 1991 to
Cordova and other parties to perform site and groundwater remediation.

     The EPA has awarded a bid to construct and operate a groundwater treatment
system for one year.  Final remediation costs for groundwater and soils cannot
presently be determined but could range from $50 million to $100 million,
depending on the remediation methods ultimately required.  Furthermore, the
Company believes that most of the remediation costs will be paid by the former
owner/operator and that its $14 million reserve will be adequate to cover the
Company's costs and expenses associated with this matter.  Included in
investments and other assets is $9 million to be recovered from insurance
companies.

Toledo, Ohio

     In 1992, the Company signed a Consent Decree with the State of Ohio
relative to the remediation of PCBs at its formerly owned Toledo, Ohio
facility.  A remediation plan for the removal of the PCBs under the Consent
Decree was approved by the State in May 1994. Site remediation is expected to
be completed in 1995.  The Company is in negotiations with the State of Ohio
regarding potential responsibility for cleaning an adjacent tributary.   The
Company believes that its established reserves of $2 million will be adequate
to cover all future costs and expenses associated with these matters.

San Gabriel Valley Basin, California

     Aerojet, through its Azusa facility, is one of a number of potentially
responsible parties (PRPs) in the portion of the San Gabriel Valley Superfund
Site known as the Baldwin Park Operable Unit (BPOU).  Regulatory action is
proceeding on two tracks:  regional groundwater remediation, under the direct
control of the EPA, and site specific investigation and cleanup supervised by
the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (Regional Board) under
delegation from the EPA.

     Aerojet's investigation concluded that the principal groundwater
contamination is upgradient of Aerojet's property and that low concentrations
of contaminants are present in the soils of Aerojet's presently and
historically owned properties.  The EPA contends that Aerojet is one of the
four largest sources of groundwater contamination at BPOU of the sixteen
companies that the EPA identified as PRPs in January 1995.  Aerojet contests
the EPA's position regarding the source of contamination and the number of PRPs
held responsible.

     The EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) on March 31, 1994 for a
groundwater remediation plan for the BPOU, estimated to cost $47 million in
non-recurring costs and $4 to $5 million in annual operating expense.  Aerojet
and other PRPs are participating in an effort by the San Gabriel Basin Water
Quality Authority, EPA and water supply organizations to develop an alternative
"consensus" plan in which certain water supply entities would integrate the EPA






                                      -10-
<PAGE>   11
Note G - Contingencies and Uncertainties (continued)
- ----------------------------------------------------
remedial requirements into a water supply project.  If implemented, the 
consensus plan will provide federal funding and funding from water supply 
entities receiving benefit from the project, thus reducing the portion of costs
to be borne by the PRPs.  Negotiations with the EPA, water supply organizations
and other PRPs concerning the consensus plan are expected to continue through 
1995 and into early 1996.

     Aerojet's San Gabriel Valley cost exposure cannot be estimated at this
time.  However, management believes, on the basis of presently available
information, that resolution of this matter will not materially affect the
consolidated financial condition of the Company.  Among the factors considered
by management are:  the number of other viable PRPs in the BPOU; the potential
for cost sharing with water supply interests; Aerojet's site-specific
investigation; and the fact that, to date, Aerojet's San Gabriel Valley costs
are being recovered from the government in the pricing of Aerojet's contracts.
Additionally, Aerojet has filed suit against its insurers for recovery of such
costs.

Other Sites

     The Company is also currently involved, together with other companies, in
21 other Superfund sites on the National Priority List under the federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
(Superfund) and 15 other non-Superfund sites.  In many instances, the Company's
liability and its proportionate share of costs has not been determined largely
due to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of site conditions, the
Company's involvement and potential recoveries from insurance and other
sources.  While government agencies frequently claim potentially responsible
parties are jointly and severally liable at such sites, in the Company's
experience, interim and final allocations of liability costs are generally made
based on relative contributions of waste.

     Such other Superfund sites include Stringfellow (California); Organic
Chemical (Michigan); Summit National (Ohio); Hardage/Criner (Oklahoma);
Industrial Excess (Ohio); and Solvent Recovery Service of New England
(Connecticut).  Other non-Superfund sites include Westbury (New York); Four
County Landfill (Indiana); and Delta Chemical (Pennsylvania).  The Company's
final allocated share of investigation and remediation costs at a number of
these sites has not yet been determined.  Based on the Company's previous
experience, its allocated share has frequently been minimal, in many instances
less than 1 percent.  The Company has reserves of approximately $19 million as
of May 31, 1995 which it believes are sufficient to cover its best estimate of
its share of the environmental remediation costs at these other sites.

Environmental Summary
- ---------------------
     In regard to the sites discussed above, management believes, on the basis
of presently available information, that resolution of these matters will not
materially affect the consolidated financial condition of the Company.  The
effect of resolution of these matters on results of operations cannot be
predicted due to the uncertainty concerning both the amount and timing of
future expenditures and future results of operations.

Other Legal Matters
- -------------------
     The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal actions,
governmental investigations, and proceedings relating to a wide range of
matters in addition to those discussed above.  In the opinion of management,
after reviewing the information which is currently available with respect to
such matters and consulting with the Company's counsel, any liability which may
ultimately be incurred with respect to these additional matters will not
materially affect the consolidated financial condition of the Company.  The
effect of resolution of these matters on results of operations cannot be
predicted because any such effect depends on both future results of operations
and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Material Changes in Financial Condition
- ---------------------------------------
     Cash flow used in operating activities for the first six months of fiscal
1995 was $25.7 million as compared to cash flow provided from operating
activities of $63.6 million for the first six months of 1994.  The increases in
cash flow used in operating activities and cash provided from financing
activities were primarily due to the required repurchase of $60 million of
receivables previously sold under the Company's receivable-backed commercial
paper program which expired on December 31, 1994 (See Note D).  The Company has
elected not to enter into a new receivable financing program at this time.

     At May 31, 1995, GenCorp's total debt was $423 million, an increase of
$6.5 million compared to the second quarter of 1994.  This change resulted from
an increase of $60 million in debt to repurchase previously sold accounts
receivable (See Note D) offset by repayments of $53.5 million.  Interest
expense in the quarter increased to $9.2 million from $7.9 million in the
comparable period last year due to higher interest rates during the second
quarter of 1995.

Material Changes in Results of Operations
- -----------------------------------------
     The Company's net sales in the second quarter of 1995 declined slightly to
$461.9 million from $467.7 million in the second quarter of 1994.  Sales growth
in the automotive and polymer products business segments was offset by lower
sales at Aerojet, the aerospace and defense business segment.

     Segment operating profit increased slightly to $37.4 million in the second
quarter of 1995, in comparison to $37.3 million in the 1994 second quarter.
The automotive and aerospace and defense business segments recorded operating
profit gains for the quarter, while the polymer products business segment
experienced a decline in operating profit.

     Net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 1995 was $16.3 million
amounting to $0.50 per share compared to $14.2 million or $0.45 per share in
the second quarter of 1994.  On a fully diluted basis, earnings per share for
the second quarter of 1995 were $0.45 per share compared to $0.40 per share in
the second quarter of 1994.

     The Company is encouraged by continued improved results at Aerojet
indicating that the business base is now stabilizing due to an improved
business climate and significant program developments over the past six months.
The automotive businesses continue to make internal productivity and quality
improvements to help offset customer pricing pressures and increased raw
material costs.   In the polymer products business segment, the issue of raw
material costs, which is being aggressively addressed through internal
performance improvement measures, continues to be an issue of concern
especially in light of a somewhat weaker demand for some of its products.

     Net sales for the automotive business segment in the second quarter of
1995 were $177.3 million, 15 percent higher than the comparable 1994 second
quarter.  Increased sales from the Vehicle Sealing Division, including sales
from HENNIGES, the Company's German original equipment automotive supplier, led
growth for the quarter.

     Segment operating profit for the automotive businesses increased to $14.1
million in the second quarter of 1995, up 3 percent from the second quarter of
1994, despite consolidation of operating losses at HENNIGES.  Operating
performance at HENNIGES improved during the second quarter, a trend that is
expected to continue throughout the year.





                                      -12-
<PAGE>   13
     During the 1995 second quarter, the Reinforced Plastics Division was
awarded its first sheet molded compound business with Toyota.  Several new
awards were also received in the quarter by the Vibration Control Division from
General Motors for the production of trailing links and from Ford for the
production of advanced fluid bushings.

     Net sales for the polymer products business segment in the second quarter
of 1995 were $163.4 million, 8 percent higher than the second quarter of 1994.
The sales improvement was led by the Specialty Polymers and Designed Plastics
Divisions.

     Segment operating profit for the polymer products businesses was $15.7
million, a decline of $1 million from the second quarter of 1994.  The decline
was due primarily to the raw material price increases and weaker demand for
some products.

     During the 1995 second quarter, the Specialty Polymers Division grew due
to strong market growth in the paper and carpeting industry.  Also, Penn
Racquet Sports Division introduced its new Pro Penn racquetball and
complementary gloves and began manufacturing the Ektelon racquetball and the
Prince Corporation private label tennis ball for distribution in Europe and the
Far East.  The Wallcovering Division has developed new opportunities for
increased wallcovering exports and during the second quarter initial shipments
of commercial wallcovering were exported to Brazil and China.  Production began
at the Designed Plastics Division on its new wide multi-stage roto gravure
printer/embosser which will provide additional manufacturing capabilities to
meet market demand.

     Negotiations continue regarding the sale of the Newcomerstown, Ohio Rigid
Plastics Plant.  This divestiture would allow the Plastic Films Division to
focus on the growth of its woodgrain laminate and flexible films operations.

     Improvement during the second half of the year for the automotive and
polymer products business segments will continue to be influenced by the U.S.
economy, the strength of  domestic vehicle build production and raw material
cost pressures.

     Net sales for Aerojet in the second quarter of 1995 were $121.2 million
compared to $162.1 million in the 1994 second quarter.  Sales in the second
quarter of 1994 included revenues from Aerojet's ordnance business, which was
divested in May 1994, and the Advanced Solid Rocket Motor program, which was
cancelled by Congress.

     Aerojet's segment operating profit for the second quarter of 1995 was $7.6
million compared to $6.9 million in the second quarter of 1994.  A better
contract mix contributed to the increase.

     During the second quarter, Aerojet received funding approval for the Sense
and Destroy Armor (SADARM) program.  The segment is also strongly positioned
for a major role in the new Space Based Infrared (SBIR) surveillance program,
the follow-on to the Defense Support Program (DSP).

     As recently announced, the Company has presently discontinued its efforts
to divest Aerojet.  Aerojet's role will be to create increased value through
enhanced operational performance focused on cost reduction, profit margin
expansion and cash generation.

     In May, the Company divested the Westward Look Resort in Tucson, Arizona.
The resort was the last major asset remaining from GenCorp's discontinued RKO
operations.  The sale of this non-core business supports the Company's strategy
of focusing on key commercial businesses where it holds leading market
positions.





                                      -13-
<PAGE>   14
     For the six months ended May 31, 1995, the Company's net sales were $890.0
million, an increase of $20.6 million over the same period for 1994.  Net other
income and expense improved from an expense of $2.4 million in 1994 to income
of $5.5 million in 1995 due primarily to the gain on the sale of Westward Look
and of other miscellaneous assets in 1995 and the absence of costs associated 
with the corporate restructuring which occurred in the first half of 1994.  Net
income for the six months ended May 31, 1995 was $23.3 million or $0.72 per
share as compared to $11.0 million or $0.35 per share for the same period in
1994 before the charge for the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting
standards.  Fully diluted earnings per share for the first six months of 1995
were $0.66 per share.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------
     GenCorp's policy is to conduct its businesses with due regard for the
preservation and protection of the environment.  The Company devotes a
significant amount of resources and management attention to environmental
matters and actively manages its ongoing processes to comply with extensive
environmental laws and regulations.  The Company is involved in the remediation
of environmental conditions which resulted from previously accepted
manufacturing and disposal practices that date back to the 1950's and 1960's
from operating certain of its own plants.  In addition, the Company has been
designated a potentially responsible party, with other companies, at sites
undergoing investigation and remediation.

     The nature of environmental investigation and cleanup activities often
makes it difficult to determine the timing and amount of any estimated future
costs that may be required for remedial measures.  However, the Company reviews
these matters and accrues for costs associated with the remediation of
environmental pollution when it becomes probable that a liability has been
incurred and its proportionate share of the amount can be reasonably estimated.
The Company recognizes amounts recoverable from third parties when the
collection of such amounts becomes probable.  The Company's Consolidated
Balance Sheet at May 31, 1995 reflects accruals of $273 million for remediation
costs and amounts recoverable of $131 million from third parties for such
costs.

     The effect of resolution of environmental matters on results of operations
cannot be predicted due to the uncertainty concerning both the amount and
timing of future expenditures and future results of operations.  However,
management believes, on the basis of presently available information, that
resolution of these matters will not materially affect the consolidated
financial condition of the Company.  The Company will continue its efforts to
mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for insurance coverage
and continued investigation of new remediation alternatives and associated
technologies.

Contingencies and Uncertainties beginning on page 8.

                      NOTES TO FINANCIAL INFORMATION

1.   Management Statement

  The financial statements as reported in this Form 10-Q reflect all
  adjustments (including those of a normal recurring nature) which are, in
  the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for
  the three and six months ended December 31, 1999 and 1998.

  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
  audited financial statements as of June 30, 1999.  Accordingly, footnote
  disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained
  in the latest audited financial statements have been omitted from this
  filing.
<TABLE>
2.   Per Share Calculation

  The following table sets forth the number of shares (in thousands) used
  in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:
<CAPTION>

        Outstanding                   12,910    13,073      12,926 13,098

  Both basic and diluted incomes are the same for computing earnings per
  share.
</TABLE>
<TABLE>

  Cash dividends per share have been computed based on the shares
  outstanding at the time the dividends were paid.  The shares (in
  thousands) used in this calculation for the three and six months ended
  December 31, 1999 and 1998 were as follows:

                                      1999       1998
         <S>                         <C>         <C>
         Quarter                     12,849      13,012
         Year-to-date                12,870      13,047
</TABLE>

3.   Contingencies

  The Company is a party to various claims and legal proceedings related
  to environmental and other matters generally incidental to its business.
  Management has evaluated each matter based, in part, upon the advice of
  its independent environmental consultants and in-house counsel and has
  recorded an appropriate provision for the resolution of such matters in
  accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5,
  "Accounting for Contingencies."  Management believes that such provision
  is sufficient to cover any future payments, including legal costs, under
  such proceedings.


4.Comprehensive Income

  In addition to net income, the only item which would be included in
  comprehensive income is foreign currency translation adjustments.  For
  the six months ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, comprehensive income
  totaled approximately $16,321,000 and $19,288,000, respectively.

<TABLE>
5.   Industry Segment Information

  The Company is composed of three product segments.  Net sales include
  only transactions with unaffiliated customers and include no
  intersegment sales.  Operating income by segment excludes general
  corporate expenses, interest expense and income, and the gain on stock
  received.

6.   Other Income

  During the previous quarter, the Company received marketable stock of an
  insurance company in which Standex owned life policies.  The stock was
  received pursuant to a plan to "demutualize" the insurance company by
  converting from a mutual company to a stock company.  The stock receipt
  resulted in recognizing an unusual gain of $2,734,000 ($1,668,000 net of
  taxes or 13 cents per share).

                  Management's Discussion and Analysis of
               Financial Condition and Results of Operations


Statements contained in the following "Management's Discussion and
Analysis" that are not based on historical facts are "forward-looking
statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of
forward-looking terminology such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe,"
"estimate," "anticipate," "continue," or similar terms or variations of
those terms or the negative of those terms.  There are many factors that
affect the Company's business and the results of its operations and may
cause the actual results of operations in future periods to differ
materially from those currently expected or desired.  These factors include
uncertainties in competitive pricing pressures, general domestic and
international business and economic conditions and market demand.


MATERIAL CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION

During the first six months of fiscal 2000 the Company invested $9.3 in
plant and equipment, purchased $3.9 million of the Company's Common Stock
and paid out $5 million in cash dividends to the Company's shareholders.
These expenditures were funded with net operating cash flows of $22.9
million.

The Company intends to continue its policy of using its funds to make
acquisitions when conditions are favorable, invest in property, plant and
equipment, pay dividends and purchase its Common Stock.

New Accounting Pronouncements - In June 1998 the Financial Accounting
Standards Board released Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities".
SFAS No. 133 establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities and will be effective for the
Company in fiscal 2001.  Management is currently evaluating the effect of
adopting SFAS No. 133 on its consolidated financial statements.


OPERATIONS

                      Quarter Ended December 31, 1999
            As compared to the Quarter Ended December 31, 1998

Net Sales for the quarter ended December 31, 1999 decreased by
approximately $8.1 million or 4.7% from the record sales of $171.2 million
for the quarter ended December 31, 1998.  The effect, on Net Sales, of
changes in the average foreign exchange rates was not significant.

Net Sales in the Food Service segment were approximately $4.0 million or
10.5% less than the prior year.  The shortfall was primarily the result of
delays in healthcare projects caused by funding constraints and Y2K
concerns, as well as a slow down in orders resulting from consolidations
within the supermarket industry.  Consumer segment Net Sales were
relatively flat after adjusting for sales attributable to a division
disposed of in fiscal 1999.  Industrial segment Net Sales, after adjustment
for the effect of approximately $2.3 million of sales attributable to
divisions disposed of in the prior year, decreased slightly.  Some
softening was experienced in the European texturizing business, which had
been driven by an extremely strong automotive demand in the comparative
prior year's quarter.  Both the Electronic and Spincraft divisions reported
record sales levels during the quarter as a result of higher customer
demand.

The Gross Profit Margin Percentage (GPMP) decreased slightly to 34% for the
quarter ended December 31, 1999 from 34.2% for the quarter ended December
31, 1998 due to the impact of the sales shortfall within the Food Service
segment.  The Industrial and Consumer segment GPMPs remained relatively
level between years.

Consolidated Selling, General and Administrative expenses remained stable
overall.  Decreases in the Food Service and Industrial segments were offset
by increases in the Consumer segment and in Corporate Services.  None of
these changes were individually significant.

A decline of 4.5% in Interest expense for the quarter was a direct result
of a corresponding decrease in debt as compared to the previous year.

Pre-tax income was $12.1 million compared to $15.4 million in the prior
year.  The effective tax rate was 37.3% compared to 39% in the prior year
since a larger portion of the Company's income this year was generated in
lower taxed countries than last year.

As a result of the above, net income for the quarter ended December 31,
1999 was $7.6 million compared to $9.4 million for the quarter ended
December 31, 1998.

                    Six Months Ended December 31, 1999
           As Compared to the Six Months Ended December 31, 1998

For the six months ended December 31, 1999, sales totaled $320.9 million
compared to $328.5 million for the previous fiscal year, which included
$9.2 million from divisions which were disposed of in fiscal 1999.  After
considering the $9.2 million decrease due to dispositions, sales increased
slightly by $1.6 million or .5%.  The effect of changes in average foreign
exchange rates from December 31, 1998 to December 31, 1999 was not
significant.

Net Sales in the Food Service segment decreased by $4.4 million or 5.8% for
reasons described in the discussion of the quarterly results.  After
adjusting for divisions disposed of in fiscal 1999, Consumer segment Net
Sales increased by $3.3 million or 2.9% and Industrial segment Net Sales
increased by $2.7 million or 2%.  The Consumer segment increases are the
result of additional stores in the Berean division and increased customer
demand.  In the Industrial segment, although the European texturizing
business reported decreased sales activity for the reasons described in the
quarterly discussion, both the Electronics and Spincraft divisions
reflected improved customer activity.

The Company's Gross Profit Margin Percentage (GPMP) remained stable at
approximately 33%.  The Food Service segment GPMP decreased from 31% to 29%
due to the decline of sales activity within the segment.  This Food Service
segment decrease was offset by small increases in the GPMP of divisions
within the Industrial and Consumer segments.

Consolidated Selling, General and Administrative expenses (SG&A) remained
unchanged as a percentage of Net Sales at approximately 23%.  Decreases in
the Industrial and Consumer segments SG&A were offset by an increase in
Corporate SG&A.  None of these variations were individually significant.

As a result of the above, operating income was $30.1 million as compared to
$33.9 million in the prior year, a decrease of 11%.

During the current six months, other income of $2.7 million was recorded
resulting from the receipt of marketable stock of an insurance company, in
which Standex owned life policies, that "demutualized" by converting from a
mutual company to a stock company.  This gain is more fully described in
the Notes to Financial Information.

A decline of almost 6% in interest expense was registered in the latest six-
month period as compared to the same period last year.  A reduction in debt
of approximately $8.5 million from a year ago accounted for the expense
decrease.

Pre-tax income was $27.6 million compared to $28.4 million in the prior
year.  The effective tax rate decreased to 38% in the current period from
39% in the prior year for the reason discussed in the quarterly analysis.

Due to the above factors, net income was $17.1 million compared to $17.4
million for the prior year.

    ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to a number of market risks, primarily the effects
of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Investments in foreign subsidiaries and branches, and their resultant
operations, denominated in foreign currencies, create exposures to changes
in exchange rates.  The Company's use of its bank credit agreements
creates an exposure to changes in interest rates.  The effect of changes
in exchange rates and interest rates on the Company's earnings has been
relatively insignificant compared to other factors that also affect
earnings, such as business unit sales and operating margins.  The Company
does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading, profit or
speculative purposes.

There have been no significant changes in the exposure to changes in both
foreign currency and interest rates from June 30, 1999 to December 31,
1999.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of
GenCorp Inc. (GenCorp or the Company) include the accounts of the parent
company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. These interim
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to
Form&nbsp;10-Q and therefore do not include all of the information and notes
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(GAAP). These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and accompanying notes included in the GenCorp Annual
Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for the fiscal year ended November&nbsp;30, 2001, as filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opinion of management, the accompanying Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of
normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company&#146;s
financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain assumptions and
estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial
statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In
addition, our operating results for interim periods may not be indicative of
the results of operations for a full fiscal year.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain reclassifications have been made to financial information for
prior periods to conform to the current period&#146;s presentation.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>2. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements</B>
</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2002, the Company became aware of certain potential accounting
issues at two of its GDX Automotive manufacturing plants in North America. The
Company promptly notified both its Audit Committee and its independent
accountants. Under the direction and oversight of the Audit Committee and with
the assistance of outside legal advisors and accounting consultants, the
Company conducted an inquiry into these and related accounting issues as well
as a more complete evaluation of accounting practices and internal control
processes throughout the Company. As a result of this process, due primarily to
activities at one GDX Automotive manufacturing plant, the Company restated its
previously issued financial statements for the years ended November&nbsp;30, 2000
and November&nbsp;30, 1999. Unaudited quarterly financial information for the first
three quarters of the year ended November&nbsp;30, 2001 was also restated.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revisions primarily arose from the correction of certain balance sheet
and income statement items, which among other things, related to the accounting
for customer-owned tooling and recognition of liabilities at one of the
Company&#146;s GDX Automotive manufacturing plants that the Company has determined
were not properly recorded in the Company&#146;s accounting records.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise expressly stated, all financial information in this
Quarterly Report on Form&nbsp;10-Q is presented inclusive of these revisions.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><B>3. Acquisitions and Disposition of Businesses</B>
</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;27, 2001, the Company reacquired the 40&nbsp;percent minority
ownership interest in AFC previously held by NextPharma Technologies USA Inc.
(NextPharma) for approximately $25&nbsp;million. The consideration included cash of
$13&nbsp;million and the return of the common stock in NextPharma&#146;s parent company
held by GenCorp, which represented approximately 31&nbsp;percent of the common stock
interest in that entity. As part of the transaction, other agreements between
the two companies were terminated, including a comprehensive sales and
marketing agreement. The sales and marketing agreement included minimum annual
cash payments of approximately $3&nbsp;million regardless of sales levels. With the
termination of these agreements, AFC reassumed responsibility for sales,
marketing and customer interface. The acquisition agreement also contains a
provision for a contingent payment of up to $12&nbsp;million in the event of a
disposition of AFC by GenCorp on or before November&nbsp;30, 2003.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A net charge of $2&nbsp;million resulted from a gain on the disposition of the
common stock in NextPharma&#146;s parent company held by GenCorp and a loss
attributable to terminating the sales and marketing agreement. The net charge
was considered an unusual item for financial reporting purposes in the first
quarter of fiscal year 2002.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerojet finalized the sale of its Electronic and Information Systems (EIS)
business to Northrop Grumman Corporation (Northrop Grumman) for $315&nbsp;million in
cash on October&nbsp;19, 2001, subject to certain working capital adjustments as
defined in the agreement. In December 2001, Northrop Grumman proposed
adjustments to the purchase price and in April 2002, the parties reached an
agreement whereby Aerojet reduced the purchase price by approximately $6
million. A $3&nbsp;million payment was paid in September 2002 and the remaining
balance is due in December 2002. The EIS business had revenues of approximately
$398&nbsp;million and pre-tax income of approximately $30&nbsp;million for the period
from December&nbsp;1, 2000 through October&nbsp;19, 2001. The results of operations for
EIS are included in the Company&#146;s Aerospace and Defense segment for all periods
presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income through the sale date. The
pre-tax gain on the transaction after the April 2002 purchase price adjustment
was $200&nbsp;million.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;29, 2000, the Company acquired The Laird Group Public Limited
Company&#146;s (The Laird Group) Draftex International Car Body Seals Division (the
Draftex business or Draftex). An independent arbitrator decided certain
adjustments to the purchase price of the Draftex business in February 2002. The
Company and The Laird Group reached an agreement on the remaining purchase
price adjustments in March 2002, resulting in a final purchase price of $205
million.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Draftex is included as part of the Company&#146;s GDX Automotive segment. As
part of the transaction, 11 manufacturing plants in Spain, France, Germany,
Czech Republic, China, and the U.S. were acquired. The acquisition was
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the excess of cost
over the fair value of the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed
was classified as goodwill. The allocation of purchase price included a reserve
for certain anticipated exit costs, including involuntary employee terminations
and associated benefits and
facility closure costs of approximately $17&nbsp;million. This restructuring plan
was completed in December 2001.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company entered into several forward exchange contracts related to the
Draftex acquisition in December 2000. Settlement of these contracts, in
December 2000, resulted in a pre-tax gain of $11&nbsp;million. Other than this
transaction, the Company has not entered into any significant foreign currency
forward exchange contracts or any other transaction involving derivative
financial instruments.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the conversion of the Company&#146;s $150&nbsp;million convertible
subordinated notes into common stock was not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended August&nbsp;31, 2002 because
the effect would be antidilutive for the period. These notes are convertible at
an initial conversion rate of 54.29 shares per $1,000 outstanding. See Note 7.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;28, 2000, the Company entered into a five-year, senior credit
facility (Credit Facility) which provides for a revolving credit facility and a
Term Loan A. As of August&nbsp;31, 2002, the available borrowing limit under the
revolving credit facility was $137&nbsp;million (excluding outstanding letters of
credit of $22&nbsp;million), of which the Company had drawn-down $60&nbsp;million. The
average interest rate on the outstanding balance of the revolving credit
facility was 4.6&nbsp;percent as of August&nbsp;31, 2002. As of August&nbsp;31, 2002 the
outstanding Term Loan A balance was $76&nbsp;million and the interest rate was 4.4
percent. As of August&nbsp;31, 2002, pursuant to Amendment No.&nbsp;2, the scheduled
repayments remaining on Term Loan A are ten equal quarterly principal payments
of $5&nbsp;million through December 2004, and four equal quarterly payments of $7
million through December 2005. The quarterly principal repayment dates for Term
Loan A are March&nbsp;28, June&nbsp;28, September&nbsp;28, and December&nbsp;28 along with
associated interest payments.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;28, 2002, the Company amended the Credit Facility to provide
an additional $25&nbsp;million term loan (Term Loan C). The $25&nbsp;million was repaid
on April&nbsp;5, 2002. The Company does not have the ability to re-borrow these
funds
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, on October&nbsp;2, 2002, the
Company amended and restated its Credit Facility. The restatement provides for
a new Term Loan B in the amount of $115&nbsp;million. Proceeds of the Term Loan B
were used to finance the acquisition discussed in Note 14 Subsequent Events,
and repay revolving loans outstanding under the Credit Facility. Repayments of
Term Loan B consist of 13 quarterly payments of $287,500 through December 2005,
four quarterly payments of $8&nbsp;million through December 2006 and a balloon
payment of $79&nbsp;million due in

</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 5 and April&nbsp;17, 2002, GenCorp sold $150&nbsp;million aggregate
principal amount of its 5.75&nbsp;percent Convertible Subordinated Notes (Notes) due
2007 in a private placement pursuant to Rule&nbsp;144A under the Securities Act of
1933. The Notes are initially convertible into 54.29 shares of the Company&#146;s
Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes at any time on or after 90
days following the date on which the notes were originally issued. Interest
accrues on the Notes at a rate of 5.75&nbsp;percent per annum payable October&nbsp;15 and
April&nbsp;15. The Notes are redeemable at the option of the holder upon a change of
control and at the option of the Company if the closing price of the Company&#146;s
Common Stock exceeds 125&nbsp;percent of the conversion price then in effect for at
least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on
the trading day before the day of the mailing of the optional redemption
notice. The Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and rank
junior in right of payment to all of the Company&#146;s other existing and future
senior indebtedness, including all of its obligations under its Credit
Facility.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issuance of the Notes generated net proceeds of $144&nbsp;million. The Company
used $25&nbsp;million of the net proceeds to repay in full Term Loan C and $119
million to repay outstanding debt under the revolving credit facility. Amounts
repaid against the outstanding debt under the revolving credit facility may be
reborrowed at any time or from time to time and may be used for any purpose,
subject to the limits contained in the Credit Facility.

action may not be filed against water purveyors regulated by the Public
Utilities Commission (PUC)&nbsp;when the water purveyors served complied with
state and federal drinking water standards<I>  (Hartwell Corporation vs. The
Superior Court of Ventura County, 38 P. 3d 1098 (Cal. </I>2002). The Court
further held that the claims against the PUC regulated defendants were
barred where the federal and state water standards have been met. In
addition, the court held that the claims against defendants not subject to
PUC regulation were not preempted. The cases had been stayed pending
investigation by the PUC; however, following the decision in<I>  Hartwell</I>, two
master complaints were filed in the proceedings and discovery was approved

Douglas Corporation (MDC), an operating unit of the Boeing Corporation, and
Aerojet are engaged in a dispute in federal court over the costs associated
with the environmental contamination of the Inactive Rancho Cordova Test
Sites (IRCTS). The IRCTS site was transferred by Aerojet to MDC and
subsequently reacquired by the Company in 1984. The dispute involves the
appropriate share of responsibility for environmental contamination by MDC
and Aerojet, and therefore the extent of each company&#146;s liability for the
offsite perchlorate groundwater contamination identified near Mather Field.
MDC has agreed it is liable and currently responsible for 50% of the cost of
remediation. MDC and Aerojet are currently unable to agree as to the
appropriate share of costs allocated to Aerojet for the remaining 50% of the
costs anticipated under the orders to investigate and clean up the
environmental contamination. A mediation session is scheduled for November
4, 2002.</FONT></TD>

Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority (WQA), the Upper San Gabriel Valley
Municipal Water District (Upper District), the Valley County Water District
(Valley), the Cal Domestic Water Company and San Gabriel Valley Water
Company who were seeking, among other things, funding for a water treatment
plant at the La Puente Valley County Water District (La Puente) well field.
In January 2001, Aerojet and certain cooperating potentially responsible
parties (PRPs) reimbursed these plaintiffs and one other funding agency $4
million for the cost of the treatment plant. Since that time, Aerojet and
the cooperating PRPs have continued to pay all operating and related costs
for treatment at the La Puente site. The plaintiffs also sued to recover
past costs in placing treatment facilities at the Big Dalton well site in
the San Gabriel Basin. Plaintiffs claimed that Aerojet was responsible for
contamination of their drinking water wells. While Aerojet was served in
the case filed by Valley, the case has been inactive. The primary claim in
these cases is for the recovery of past and future CERCLA response costs for
treatment plants at plaintiffs&#146; well sites.</FONT></TD>

alleged exposure to VC. Five of these cases have been filed since May 2002.
With the exception of one case, brought by the family of a former Ashtabula

civil co-conspirator with other VC and PVC manufacturers. Plaintiffs allege
that GenCorp suppressed information about the carcinogenic risk of VC to
industry workers, and placed VC or PVC into commerce without sufficient
warnings. Of these 17 cases, nine have been settled or dismissed on terms
favorable to the Company, including the case where GenCorp was the employer
(<I>McKinley, et al. v. GenCorp Inc</I>.). During the second quarter of 2002,
<I>Valentine, et al. v. PPG Industries of Ohio, Inc., et al.,</I> was voluntarily

facility during which the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union (Union)
claimed that the employees had the legal right to strike due to &#147;abnormally
dangerous&#148; working conditions under Section&nbsp;502 of the National Labor
Relations Act. The alleged &#147;abnormally dangerous&#148; conditions purportedly
existed due to the radioactive nature of DU. The Union claimed this made the
strike an &#147;unfair labor practice strike,&#148; which prevented permanent
replacement of the 200 strikers. AOT replaced the strikers and, as a
consequence, the Union filed its unfair labor practice charge with the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)&nbsp;in 1982.</FONT></TD>

Union appealed the dismissal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals (Case No.
93-1299), which remanded the case to the NLRB in 1995 for reconsideration of
the standards to be applied in determining &#147;abnormally dangerous&#148; working

        <TD><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;30, 1999, the NLRB held that AOT committed an unfair labor
practice when it refused to reinstate striking workers that had made an
unconditional offer to return to work if reinstated. AOT appealed the NLRB
Order to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals (Case No.&nbsp;99-6379). On July&nbsp;10,
2002, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the NLRB. The appeals
court held that the record in the litigation did not fully resolve the
factual issue as to &#147;abnormally dangerous&#148; conditions in the plant, but at
the same time, the NLRB&#146;s delay in rendering its final decision more than
20&nbsp;years later was &#147;inexcusable&#148; and no further proceedings were warranted.
Therefore, the appeals court vacated the NLRB&#146;s prior ruling against the
Company. On October&nbsp;8, 2002, the Union filed a petition for writ of
certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court, on the grounds that the Sixth
Circuit Court had no authority to vacate the NLRB&#146;s order due solely to the
extensive delay in the final resolution of the proceedings. The Company
will vigorously defend the judgment of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals
before the Supreme Court.</FONT></TD>

liability, finding GenCorp 30&nbsp;percent liable for remediation costs at &#147;Big D

Consent Decree (Decree) requiring Aerojet to conduct a Remedial
Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) of Aerojet&#146;s Sacramento, California
site. The Decree required Aerojet to prepare a RI/FS report on specific
environmental conditions present at the site and alternatives available to
remediate such conditions. Aerojet also is required to pay for certain
governmental oversight costs associated with Decree compliance. Beginning
in the mid 1990s, the State of California expanded its surveillance of
perchlorate and nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). Under the RI/FS, traces of
these chemicals were detected in public water supply wells near Aerojet&#146;s
Sacramento site using new testing protocols.</FONT></TD>

EPA as a PRP in the portion of the San Gabriel Valley Superfund Site known

remediation was issued and Aerojet and 18 other PRPs received Special Notice
Letters requiring groundwater remediation. All of the Special Notice PRPs

Aerojet&#146;s investigation demonstrated that the groundwater contamination by
VOCs is principally upgradient of Aerojet&#146;s property and that lower
concentrations of VOC contaminants are present in the soils of Aerojet&#146;s
presently and historically owned properties. EPA contends that of the 19
PRPs identified by EPA, Aerojet is one of the four largest sources of VOC
groundwater contamination at the BPOU. Aerojet contests the EPA&#146;s position

by Aerojet in the same time period. It is also a contaminant in cutting
oils used by many businesses and is found in many foods. In addition, new
regulatory standards for a chemical known as 1,4 dioxane require additional

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2001, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)&nbsp;was executed by
eight of the Special Notice PRPs, including Aerojet, and the Watermaster and
certain local water purveyors to resolve controversies between them and to
provide for the implementation of the EPA approved remedy for the BPOU. The
MOU provided for an interim allocation agreement among the eight PRPs pending
completion of a final allocation procedure.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following extended negotiations, Aerojet, along with seven other PRPs
(collectively, the &#147;Cooperating Respondents&#148;) signed a Project Agreement in
late March 2002 with Water Quality Authority (WQA), Watermaster, Valley
County Water District, La Puente Valley Water District, San Gabriel Valley
Water Company, Suburban Water Systems and California Domestic Water Company
(collectively, the &#147;Water Entities&#148;). The Project Agreement became effective
on May&nbsp;9, 2002, following approval by a California Superior Court and the
finalization of policy language on the $100&nbsp;million Baldwin Park Operable
Unit Manuscript Environmental Site Liability Policy from Chubb Custom
Insurance Company covering certain Project risks.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic structure of the Project Agreement is for the Cooperating
Respondents to fund and financially assure (in the form of cash or letters of
credit) the cost of certain treatment and water distribution facilities to be
owned and operated by the Water Entities. Actual funding would be provided
by funds placed in escrow at the start of each three-month period to cover
anticipated costs for the succeeding quarter.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cooperating Respondents will also fund operation and maintenance of
treatment facilities (not including ordinary operating expenses of the local
water purveyors, certain costs for replacement water that may be incurred by
such Water Entities and related administrative costs, collectively, &#147;O&#038;M&#148;
costs). The Cooperating Respondents are required to maintain sufficient
financial assurance to cover the estimated O&#038;M for two years. Actual O&#038;M
payments would be made at the start of each three-month period to cover
anticipated costs for the succeeding six-month period. When fully
constructed, six treatment facilities will be treating in excess of 25,000
gallons per minute for the purposes of ROD implementation and to provide
potable water supply. The Project Agreement has a term of 15&nbsp;years. The
Project Agreement also settles the past environmental claims of the Water
Entities.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerojet and the other Cooperating Respondents have entered into an
interim allocation agreement that establishes the interim payment obligations
of Aerojet and the remaining Cooperating Respondents for the costs of the
Project Agreement. Aerojet anticipates that the parties may seek to mediate
final allocation, but, if unsuccessful, litigation could occur. Aerojet is
responsible for approximately two-thirds of all project costs, pending
completion of any allocation proceeding. All project costs are subject to
reallocation among the Cooperating Respondents.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total non-recurring cost of all the projects, including costs
already incurred, is estimated at approximately $116&nbsp;million. The total
project cost (including non-recurring costs and operation and maintenance
costs), is estimated to be approximately $295&nbsp;million. (A discussion of
Aerojet&#146;s efforts to estimate these costs is contained below under the
heading &#147;Environmental Reserves and Estimated Recoveries.&#148;) Based upon
Aerojet&#146;s interim allocation and taking into account funds that Aerojet has
already paid, this would require future funding by Aerojet of approximately
$143&nbsp;million over the 15&nbsp;years term of the agreement. A significant amount
of public funding is available to offset project costs. To date, Congress
has appropriated approximately $40&nbsp;million (so called Title 16 and Dreier
funds), which is potentially available for payment of project costs. All such
funding will require Water Quality Authority (WQA)&nbsp;action to allocate funds
to the project, which the WQA is currently considering. Based upon WQA
preliminary actions to date, Aerojet anticipates that at least $25&nbsp;million of
the funding

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the EIS sale to Northrop Grumman in October 2001, EPA
approved a Prospective Purchaser Agreement with Northrop Grumman to absolve
it of pre-closing liability for contamination caused by the Azusa facility,
which liability will remain with Aerojet. As part of that agreement, Aerojet
agreed to put $40&nbsp;million into an irrevocable escrow for the BPOU project to
implement the EPA UAO, and GenCorp agreed to provide a $25&nbsp;million guarantee
for Aerojet&#146;s share of remediation costs in the BPOU. The $40&nbsp;million is
being used to fund Aerojet&#146;s obligations under the Project Agreement and the
funds not already expended for that purpose have been transferred to the
escrow under the Project Agreement to pay Aerojet&#146;s share of future
non-recurring costs and O&#038;M. A separate $9&nbsp;million payment was made by
Aerojet to EPA for its past costs. EPA will maintain these funds for
possible use on the BPOU project.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the agreement to sell the EIS business to Northrop Grumman,
Aerojet has paid EPA $9&nbsp;million to be offset against Aerojet&#146;s share of EPA&#146;s
claimed past costs of approximately $22&nbsp;million. A very substantial share of
EPA&#146;s past costs related to the period prior to 1997 when the sole
contamination being considered involved VOCs. Aerojet believes that it is
responsible for less than ten percent of these costs. As a result, in the
allocation with the other PRPs, Aerojet will seek to recover a significant
portion of the $9&nbsp;million paid to EPA from the other PRPs. Unresolved at this
time is the issue of California&#146;s past costs which were last estimated at
approximately $4&nbsp;million.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerojet intends to defend itself vigorously to assure that it is
appropriately treated with other PRPs and that costs of any remediation are
properly spread over all users of the San Gabriel Valley aquifer. In
addition, Aerojet is also pursuing its insurance remedies.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;9, 2001, GenCorp received a General Notice Letter from EPA
asserting that GenCorp is a PRP for the BPOU. This General Notice Letter was
received more than ten years after the General Notice given to GenCorp&#146;s
subsidiary, Aerojet. EPA alleged that in the 1940s and early 1950s GenCorp&#146;s
predecessor, The General Tire &#038; Rubber Company, participated in a joint
venture with Aerojet Engineering Corporation, a predecessor to
Aerojet-General Corporation, sharing 50&nbsp;percent of the profits on certain
U.S. Navy contracts for JATO rockets and that it had some role in managing
the joint venture at the Azusa facility. GenCorp strongly disagrees with EPA
designation. EPA is factually incorrect; at all times, Aerojet was the sole
party that owned or operated the Azusa site during the early production of
the JATO rockets. GenCorp strongly disagrees with EPA&#146;s PRP designation and
plans to resist the designation at every level possible.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;28, 2002, EPA issued a unilateral First Amended
Administrative Order For Remedial Design and Remedial Action (Amended Order)
for the BPOU. The Amended Order does not materially alter the obligations of
Aerojet under the earlier UAO; however, the Amended Order names GenCorp as a
Respondent on the basis of the allegations made in the General Notice Letter.
The Amended Order does not require GenCorp to undertake any action unless
Aerojet fails to perform its obligations under the UAO. It states that
GenCorp is being added to the Amended Order &#147;as a backup&#148; to Aerojet&#146;s
performance; and it provides that GenCorp is deemed to be in compliance with
the Amended Order on the effective date of the Amended Order. Because GenCorp
does not believe it was properly designated a PRP at the site, the Company is
evaluating an appropriate response to the Amended Order.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;21, 2000, Aerojet received an order from the Los Angeles
Region office of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (the
Regional Board) requiring a work plan for investigation of Aerojet&#146;s former
El Monte facility. On January&nbsp;22, 2001, Aerojet filed an appeal of the order
with the Regional Board asserting selective enforcement. The appeal is in
abeyance pending negotiations with the Regional Board. In March 2001, Aerojet
submitted a limited work plan to the Regional Board in light of the Regional
Board&#146;s failure to adequately seek similar investigations by lessees and
owners of the facility following Aerojet&#146;s ownership. On February&nbsp;21, 2001,
Aerojet received a General Notice Letter from EPA Region IX naming Aerojet as
a PRP to the SEMOU of the San Gabriel Valley Superfund site. Aerojet
continues to negotiate with the Regional Board for a limited investigation of
this former facility. Aerojet has begun the process of obtaining access
agreements should the Regional Board approve Aerojet&#146;s work plan.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;1, 2002, Aerojet received a special notice letter from EPA
(dated March&nbsp;28, 2002) that requested that Aerojet enter into negotiations
with EPA regarding the performance of a remedial design and remedial action
for the SEMOU. In light of this letter, Aerojet performed a limited site
investigation of the East Flair Drive Site. The data collected and summarized
in the Field Investigation Report showed that chemicals including TCE and PCE
were present in the soil and groundwater at and near the East Flair Drive
Site. The Field Investigation Report also showed that the hydraulic gradient
at the East Flair Drive Site is oriented toward the northeast. This finding
indicates that the site is not a likely source of contamination at the SEMOU,
as the ground water flow at the site is away from the SEMOU and not toward
it. In light of the data indicating that the East Flair Drive Site is not a
source of the contamination at the SEMOU, Aerojet requested that EPA
reconsider its issuance of the SEMOU special notice letter.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, Aerojet has not received a response to the Field Investigation
Report from either the Regional Board or EPA. Aerojet continues to work
cooperatively with the Regional Board for a limited investigation of the East
Flair Drive Site and with EPA regarding the SEMOU.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerojet was informed that in mid-August 2002, four civil suits were
filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that
seek recovery of costs allegedly incurred in response to the contamination
present at the SEMOU. Aerojet was informed that two of the suits were filed
by private drinking water purveyors, San Gabriel Valley Water Company and
Southern California Water Company, and two were filed by local government
agencies, the San Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority and the City of
Monterey Park. Aerojet has not been served with any of these complaints.

in approximately 21 other Superfund and non-Superfund remediation sites. In
many instances, the Company&#146;s liability and proportionate share of costs have
not been determined largely due to uncertainties as to the nature and extent
of site conditions and the Company&#146;s involvement. While government agencies
frequently claim PRPs are jointly and severally liable at such sites, in the
Company&#146;s experience, interim and final allocations of liability costs are
generally made based on relative contributions of waste. Based on the

reasonably possible costs can be estimated. In establishing the Company&#146;s
reserves, the most probable estimate amount is used when determinable and the
minimum is used when no single amount is more probable.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As disclosed in the Company&#146;s Form&nbsp;10Q filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for the three months ended May&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company
planned to complete in the third quarter its most recent periodic
reexamination (tri-annual &#147;bottom-up&#148; environmental remediation cost
evaluation) of estimated future environmental costs. That review was based
on a range of technical information and reasonable scientific assumptions,
which incorporated, but are not limited to the following: (i)&nbsp;environmental
engineering studies to determine the scope of possible remediation scenarios
and related cost estimates based on currently available technologies and
current regulatory requirements; and, (ii)&nbsp;assumptions based on current
regulatory practices. In addition, other environmental events occurred
during the third quarter of 2002, including receipt of EPA&#146;s Unilateral
Administrative Order to implement remedial actions for the Western
Groundwater Operable Unit in Sacramento and the status of the dispute between
Aerojet and MDC involving remediation of the IRCTS facility in Sacramento.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the reexamination of estimated future remediation costs and
based on events occurring in the third quarter, the Company increased its
reserves for environmental costs by $107&nbsp;million to a total of $323&nbsp;million.
The $107&nbsp;million reserve increase is the net result of a number of decreases
and increases in previous cost estimates. Decreases result from: (i)&nbsp;status
of work completed since the last estimate in 1999; and, (ii)&nbsp;expected cost
savings related to the substitution of new remediation technology and to
information not available previously. Increases include additions for: (i)
obligations for reimbursement of regulatory agency past costs; (ii)
additional BPOU costs; (iii)&nbsp;Western Groundwater UAO costs including
replacement water and remediation upgrades; (iv)&nbsp;estimated revisions related
to the IRCTS site and to the periodic reexamination of estimated future
environmental costs of Aerojet&#146;s Sacramento site; (v)&nbsp;new information related
to the extent and location of previously identified contamination; and (vi)
additional construction contingencies.

</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;12, 1999, Aerojet and the U.S. Government implemented the
October 1997 Agreement in Principle (&#147;Global Settlement&#148;) resolving certain
prior environmental and facility disagreements, with retroactive effect to
December&nbsp;1, 1998. The Global Settlement covered all environmental
contamination at the Sacramento and Azusa sites. Under the Global
Settlement, Aerojet and the U.S. Government resolved disagreements about an
appropriate cost-sharing ratio. The Global Settlement contemplates that the
cost-sharing ratio will continue for a substantial number of years.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Global Settlement covering environmental costs
associated with Aerojet&#146;s Sacramento and Azusa operating sites, the Company
can recover up to 88% of its environmental remediation costs for these sites
through the establishment of prices for Aerojet&#146;s products and services sold
to the U.S. Government. The ability of Aerojet to continue recovering these
costs from the U.S. Government depends on Aerojet&#146;s sustained business volume
under U.S. Government contracts and programs and the relative size of
Aerojet&#146;s commercial business.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerojet entered into an agreement with Northrop Grumman in conjunction
with the sale of EIS, whereby Aerojet will be reimbursed by Northrop Grumman
for 50% of environmental expenditures eligible for recovery under the Global
Settlement. Amounts reimbursed are subject to annual limitations, with
excess amounts carrying over to subsequent periods, the total of which will
not exceed $190&nbsp;million over the term of the agreement, which ends in 2028.
As of August&nbsp;31, 2002, $181&nbsp;million in potential future reimbursements was
available over the remaining life of the agreement.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with the review of its environmental obligations the
Company also revised its estimate of costs that will be recovered under the
Global Settlement, increasing its estimated cost recoveries in the third
quarter to $235&nbsp;million from $142&nbsp;million at the end of the second quarter.
The adjustments to the environmental remediation reserves and estimated
future cost recoveries did not affect operating results in the third quarter
as the impact of increases to the reserves was offset by estimated increased
recoveries in the future. Aerojet&#146;s historical environmental cost recovery
has been higher than that reflected in its previous recovery estimates. The
Company believes that, due to the proportion of Aerojet&#146;s business expected
to be conducted under contracts with the U.S. Government and its agencies in
the future, its environmental cost recoveries will continue to be higher than
previously estimated.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>(iii)&nbsp; Environmental Reserves and Estimated Recoveries</I>
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s net environmental obligation, the excess of environmental
reserves over expected cost recoveries, was $111&nbsp;million as of August&nbsp;31,
2002 and May&nbsp;31, 2002. The effect of the final resolution of environmental
matters and the Company&#146;s obligations for environmental remediation and
compliance cannot be predicted due to the uncertainty concerning both the
amount and timing of future expenditures due to regulatory or technological
changes. However, management believes, on the basis of presently available
information, that the resolution of environmental matters and the Company&#146;s
obligations for environmental remediation and compliance will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations, liquidity or
financial condition. The Company will continue its efforts to mitigate past
and future costs through pursuit of claims for recoveries from insurance
coverage and other PRPs and continued investigation of new and more cost
effective remediation alternatives and associated technologies.

</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s continuing operations are organized into three segments
based primarily on the types of products and customers: GDX Automotive,
Aerospace and Defense, and Fine Chemicals. See Note 1 for additional
information related to the Company&#146;s operating segments.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, of
which the primary financial measure is segment operating profit. Segment
operating profit represents net sales from continuing operations less
applicable costs, expenses and provisions for restructuring and unusual items
relating to operations. Segment operating profit also excludes corporate income
and expenses, provisions for unusual items, interest expense, income taxes and
any minority interest. See Note 12 related to unusual items reflected in the
Company&#146;s financial results and Note 3 related to the acquisition of Draftex in
December 2000, Aerojet&#146;s sale of its EIS business in October 2001 and GenCorp&#146;s
reacquisition of the minority ownership interest in AFC in December 2001.

</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2002, as discussed in Note 3, Aerojet reached an agreement with
Northrop Grumman on purchase price adjustments related to the sale of its EIS
business whereby Aerojet reduced the purchase price by approximately $6
million. The purchase price reduction was recorded as an unusual expense item
in segment operating profit for the second quarter of 2002. The Company
recorded an unusual expense item of $1&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2002
for the write-off of bank fees associated with the termination of Term Loan C.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2001, as discussed in Note 3, the Company reacquired the
minority ownership interest in its AFC subsidiary and certain agreements
between AFC and the minority ownership interest holder were terminated. The net
result of the transaction was an unusual expense item of $2&nbsp;million in the
first quarter of 2002.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recorded a charge in earnings from continuing operations of
$19&nbsp;million during the second quarter of 2001 related to a restructuring and
consolidation of its GDX Automotive segment. The restructuring program included
the closure of the Marion, Indiana and Ballina, Ireland manufacturing
facilities and resulted in the elimination of approximately 760 employee
positions. The decision to close these facilities was precipitated by excess
capacity and deterioration of performance and losses at these sites. The
decision to close the Ballina, Ireland plant was also due to difficulty in
retaining plant personnel in light of record employment levels in the region.
Remaining programs from these facilities were transferred to other facilities.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second quarter of 2001, the Company settled outstanding claims
with the Internal Revenue Service and the State of California. The benefit of
the tax refund, $4&nbsp;million on an after tax basis, was recorded in the income
tax provision in the second quarter. The portion of the tax refunds that will
be repaid to the Company&#146;s defense customers is reflected as an unusual expense
item of $2&nbsp;million in segment income ($1&nbsp;million after tax). Accordingly, after
repayment to the Company&#146;s defense customers, the Company will retain $3
million of the claims settled in the second quarter.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, during the first quarter of 2001, the Company reached a
settlement with the State of California on an outstanding tax claim. The
benefit of the tax refund, $9&nbsp;million on an after tax basis, was recorded in
the income tax provision in the first quarter. The portion of the tax refund
that will be repaid to the Company&#146;s defense customers is reflected as an
unusual expense item of $7&nbsp;million in segment income ($4&nbsp;million after tax).
Accordingly, after repayment to the Company&#146;s defense customers, the Company
will retain $5&nbsp;million of the claims settled in the first quarter.

</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective July&nbsp;1, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
141, &#147;Business Combinations&#148; (SFAS 141), which is effective for all business
combinations initiated after June&nbsp;30, 2001. SFAS 141 prohibits the use of the
pooling-of-interest method for business combinations and establishes the
accounting and financial reporting requirements for business combinations
accounted for by the purchase method. SFAS 141 also changes the criteria to
recognize intangible assets apart from goodwill. The Company adopted the
provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;142, &#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#148; (SFAS 142)
effective December&nbsp;1, 2001. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and indefinite lived
intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually, or more
frequently if indications of possible impairment exist, for impairment. The
Company has performed the requisite transitional impairment tests for goodwill
and other intangible assets as of December&nbsp;1, 2001 and has determined that
these assets are not impaired as of that date. Annual impairment tests for
goodwill and other intangible assets will be performed as of September&nbsp;1, or as
necessary if indicators of possible impairment are present. The adoption of
SFAS 142 results in a reduction of annual amortization expenses of
approximately $4&nbsp;million related to goodwill and other indefinite lived
intangible assets. Net income for the three and nine month periods ended August
31, 2001, adjusted to exclude amortization expense related to goodwill and
other indefinite lived intangible assets would be $4&nbsp;million and $25&nbsp;million,
respectively. The adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on
the Company&#146;s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;144, &#147;Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets&#148; (SFAS 144) that provides
accounting guidance for financial accounting and reporting for the impairment
or disposal of long-lived assets. The statement supercedes SFAS No.&nbsp;121,

the Results of Operations &#150; Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions&#148; related to the disposal of a segment of a business. SFAS 144 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2001, with early
adoption encouraged. The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS 144 as of
December&nbsp;1, 2001. The adoption of SFAS 144 did not have a material effect on
the Company&#146;s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;5, 2002, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors declared a
quarterly dividend of three cents per share on the Company&#146;s ten cents par

shareholders of record on November&nbsp;1, 2002.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;2, 2002, the Company announced that Aerojet had completed the
acquisition of the assets of General Dynamics&#146; Ordnance and Tactical Systems
Space Propulsion and Fire Suppression (&#147;GDSS&#148;) business. The cost of the
acquisition was approximately $90&nbsp;million, which was funded from the proceeds
of a new term loan established in conjunction with the amended and restated
Credit Facility described in Note 7.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During October 2002, the Company announced a restructuring in the GDX
Automotive segment. The plan includes closure of a plant in Germany, with
existing production moving to another existing plant in Germany and a reduction
in workforce at GDX Automotive headquarters in Farmington Hills, Michigan. A
charge for the $2&nbsp;million cost of the restructuring will be included in fourth
quarter operating results.

Part I, Item&nbsp;1 of this report, and focuses on the Company&#146;s continuing

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><I>Restatement of Previously Issued
Financial Statements</I>
</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2002, the Company became aware of certain potential accounting
issues at two of its GDX Automotive manufacturing plants in North America. The
Company promptly notified both its Audit Committee and its independent
accountants. Under the direction and oversight of the Audit Committee and with
the assistance of outside legal advisors and accounting consultants, the
Company conducted an inquiry into these and related accounting issues as well
as a more complete evaluation of accounting practices and internal control
processes throughout the Company. As a result of this process, due primarily to
activities at one GDX Automotive manufacturing plant, the Company restated its
previously issued financial statements for the years ended November&nbsp;30, 2000
and November&nbsp;30, 1999. Unaudited quarterly financial information for the first
three quarters of the year ended November&nbsp;30, 2001 was also restated (see Note
2 in Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained
in Part I, Item&nbsp;1 of this report). For additional information see Notes 2 and
12 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item&nbsp;8 of
the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for the year ended November&nbsp;30, 2001
filed with the SEC.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revisions primarily arose from the correction of (i)&nbsp;certain balance
sheet and income statement items, which among other things, related to the
accounting for customer-owned tooling, inventories and recognition of
liabilities at one of the Company&#146;s GDX Automotive manufacturing plants that
the Company has determined were not properly recorded in the Company&#146;s books
and records; and (ii)&nbsp;an oversight in collecting data for the calculation for
certain postretirement benefit liabilities at one of GDX Automotive&#146;s non-U.S.
facilities in the year ended November&nbsp;30, 1996 with no material impact on
fiscal years 1998 and 1997. At the direction of the Audit Committee of the
GenCorp Board of Directors, the Company has implemented certain enhancements to
its financial organization, systems and controls primarily at its GDX
Automotive segment in response to issues raised by the restatement and
identified by the Company&#146;s independent accountants as material weaknesses.

diluted EPS was reduced to $0.51 from $0.58.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><I>Anticipated Cost Savings from
Restructuring Programs</I>
</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company continues to focus on cost-reduction initiatives in each of
its operating segments as well as at the GenCorp corporate level. The Company
announced a voluntary enhanced retirement program for certain employees in
September 2001. During 2001, AFC&#146;s workforce was reduced by approximately 40%.
In December 2001, a comprehensive sales and marketing agreement between AFC and
NextPharma was terminated (see related discussion below). In the GDX Automotive
segment, as part of the Company&#146;s strategy to realize synergies between its
historical operations and those acquired with the acquisition of Draftex, four
manufacturing facilities have been closed, three in fiscal 2001 and one in
fiscal 2002. In addition, as recently announced, an additional facility will
be closed in Germany.. The GDX Automotive segment is implementing &#147;lean
manufacturing&#148; principles and other programs aimed at improving operational
efficiency at the segment&#146;s remaining manufacturing facilities. Since December
2000, GDX Automotive has eliminated approximately 1,600 full-time and temporary
positions, including positions at GDX Automotive&#146;s corporate headquarters.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><I>GDX Automotive Segment</I>
</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;29, 2000, the Company acquired The Laird Group Public Limited
Company&#146;s (The Laird Group) Draftex International Car Body Seals Division (the
Draftex business or Draftex). Draftex had revenues of $437&nbsp;million for the year
ended December&nbsp;29, 2000. The sales added by the Draftex acquisition are
primarily outside the U.S. See Note 3 in Notes to Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item&nbsp;1 of this report
for additional information related to the acquisition of the Draftex business,
including a final adjustment to the purchase price recorded in March 2002.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net sales for the Company&#146;s GDX Automotive segment totaled $190&nbsp;million
for the third quarter of fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001. Net sales for the segment
for the nine months ended August&nbsp;31, 2002, decreased to $589&nbsp;million from $598
million for the comparable period in the prior year. Year-to-date net sales are
lower than the previous year due to $15&nbsp;million in price adjustments offset by
favorable exchange rate impacts of $4&nbsp;million and $2&nbsp;million in increased sales
volumes. Net sales attributable to the Draftex business for the first nine
months were $284&nbsp;million in 2002 and $260&nbsp;million in 2001. The results for
Draftex for the first nine months of 2001 include eight months of activity
subsequent to the acquisition date.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GDX Automotive segment recorded an operating profit of $5&nbsp;million for
the third quarter of fiscal 2002 versus an operating loss of $5&nbsp;million for the
comparable period in fiscal 2001. Operating margins were higher at three
percent in the quarter compared to negative three percent for third quarter
2001 reflecting improved plant productivity driven by cost and personnel
reductions. Operating profit for the nine months ended August&nbsp;31, 2002 was $25
million compared to an operating loss of $2&nbsp;million in 2001 with operating
profit margins increasing to four percent as compared to a negative one percent
in the first nine months of fiscal 2001. Overall improvement in operating
margins reflects the impact of the restructuring that took place in 2001.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2001, operating margins were negatively
affected by pricing and volume mix issues and higher health care costs.
Historically, GDX Automotive has experienced higher margins in its second and
fourth quarters.

</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net sales for the Company&#146;s Aerospace and Defense segment totaled $63
million for the third quarter of fiscal 2002 as compared to $161&nbsp;million in the
third quarter of 2001. Excluding results from Aerojet&#146;s divested EIS business
in October 2001, sales increased approximately $11&nbsp;million due primarily to
increased volume on its Divert and Attitude Control System programs. Net sales
for the nine months ended August&nbsp;31, 2002 were $201&nbsp;million compared with $511
million in 2001 and reflects the impact of the EIS divestiture as described in
more detail in Note 3 in Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements. Excluding the results of the EIS business, net sales for the
segment increased $39&nbsp;million for the nine-month period ending August&nbsp;31, 2002
as compared to the same period in 2001. Increased net sales are related to
delivery of a NASA X-38 De-Orbit Propulsion Stage, increased volume on the
COBRA booster engine and other NASA technology programs, assembly and electron
beam welding of the forward boom in the aft fuselage for Boeing&#146;s F-22 Raptor
program.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating profit for the Aerospace and Defense segment was $14&nbsp;million for
the third quarter of fiscal 2002. Operating profit for the segment was $30
million for the third quarter of fiscal 2001. Excluding the results of the EIS
business and a decrease in net pension income, segment operating profit and
associated margin increased from the comparable quarter in 2001. Operating
profit for the nine months ended August&nbsp;31, 2002 was $44&nbsp;million compared with
$86&nbsp;million in 2001. Excluding the results of the EIS business and lower
pension income, year-to-date operating profit for the segment increased as
compared to the same nine-month period of fiscal 2001. The segment recorded
approximately $18&nbsp;million less pre-tax pension income for the first nine months
of fiscal 2002 as compared with the same period of fiscal 2001, primarily due
to the sale of EIS and declines in the market value of pension assets. See
Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item
8 of the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for the year ended November&nbsp;30,
2001 filed with the SEC.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant events during the quarter included the successful
demonstration of Lockheed Martin&#146;s Atlas V core launch vehicle, certain
versions of which will eventually utilize Aerojet&#146;s Solid Rocket Booster
Motors, and a $43&nbsp;million sole source contract award from Boeing Phantom works
to develop &#147;HyFly&#148; dual combustion ramjet test flight engines for the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency and Office of Naval Research. In addition,
Aerojet received notice that, due to funding constraints, the customer will not
exercise its option to extend the COBRA contract beyond September 2002. This
change will not have a significant affect on Aerojet&#146;s 2002 operating results
or the 2003 business plan.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;15, 2002, an Atlas V solid rocket motor undergoing testing
experienced an anomaly which has undergone investigation by Aerojet and its
customer Lockheed Martin. The review is complete and the required
modifications have taken place. An additional test has been scheduled , and
absent any unknown delays, qualification testing should be complete by

</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fine Chemicals segment consists of the operations of AFC, a business
that supplies final active pharmaceutical ingredients and registered
intermediates to both pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2001, the Company reacquired the 40&nbsp;percent minority ownership
interest in AFC held by NextPharma Technologies USA (NextPharma). As part of
the transaction, other agreements between the two companies were terminated,
including a comprehensive sales and marketing agreement (see related discussion
above). With the termination of these agreements, AFC reassumed responsibility
for sales, marketing and customer interface. See Note 3 in Notes to Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related
to this transaction.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The segment operating results for the Fine Chemicals segment for fiscal
2001 include the results of AFC before considering NextPharma&#146;s 40&nbsp;percent
minority interest. The minority ownership position in AFC is reflected in the
consolidated results for GenCorp as a component of corporate and other expenses
through December&nbsp;27, 2001, the date GenCorp reacquired NextPharma&#146;s minority
ownership interest in AFC.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net sales for AFC in the third quarter of 2002 totaled $13&nbsp;million
compared with $5&nbsp;million for the third quarter of 2001. For the first nine
months of fiscal 2002, net sales totaled $28&nbsp;million compared with $10&nbsp;million
for the first nine months of fiscal 2001. AFC reported an operating profit of
$3&nbsp;million for the third quarter of fiscal 2002 versus an operating loss of $6
million for the comparable quarter in fiscal 2001. AFC&#146;s operating loss for the
first nine months of fiscal 2002 was $1&nbsp;million compared with an operating loss
of $15&nbsp;million for the first nine months of fiscal 2001. Operating margins in
fiscal 2002 continue to improve reflecting higher production volumes,
operational improvements and the realization of cost savings resulting from the
restructuring program completed in November of 2001. In addition, AFC&#146;s
financial performance in fiscal 2001 was negatively affected by beginning
production of several new products, a process that typically includes a period
of inefficiency.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of August&nbsp;31, 2002, AFC&#146;s contract backlog was $43&nbsp;million versus $32
million as of November&nbsp;30, 2001.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><I>Interest and Other Expenses</I>
</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the third quarter of fiscal 2002, interest expense decreased to $4
million from $10&nbsp;million for the comparable period in fiscal 2001. Interest
expense for the nine months ended August&nbsp;31, 2002 decreased to $11&nbsp;million from
$28&nbsp;million in 2001. The decrease was due primarily to a lower average
outstanding debt level and lower average interest rates in the first nine
months of fiscal 2002. Debt outstanding at November 2001 of $214&nbsp;million
reflected debt reduction in the fourth quarter of 2001 from the sale of EIS.
During 2002, debt increased to $292&nbsp;million at the end of the third quarter due
primarily to working capital requirements, including needs for Aerojet&#146;s Atlas
V Solid Rocket Motor contract.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate and other expenses and foreign exchange gains and losses
increased in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 to $6&nbsp;million compared to $4
million for the comparable period in fiscal 2001. As compared to the same
period in the prior year, the change is principally related to increased
professional fees, lower pension income and increased net minority interest
expense. For the nine-month period ended August&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company recorded
corporate and other expenses of $21&nbsp;million compared with corporate and other
income of $1&nbsp;million for the same nine-month period in 2001. The net change of
$22&nbsp;million is attributable to an $11&nbsp;million foreign exchange gain in the
first quarter of 2001, approximately $6&nbsp;million related to the cost of outside
legal advisors and accounting consultants to assist with the inquiry related to
the accounting issues mentioned above and increased overall professional
services expenses and increased net minority interest expense. The foreign
exchange gain in fiscal 2001 resulted from foreign currency forward purchase
contracts that were entered into to hedge against fluctuations in the U.S.
dollar-euro exchange rate in anticipation of the Draftex acquisition.

</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the quarter the Company contributed property in Michigan to the
County of Muskegon. The Company will receive a tax deduction for this
contribution that has reduced its year to date effective tax rate by two
percentage points to 37%. The income tax provision for the first nine months of
fiscal 2001 included a benefit of approximately $9&nbsp;million related to the
settlement of certain income tax claims with the State of California.

</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2002, as discussed in Note 3 in Notes to Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements, Aerojet reached an agreement with Northrop
Grumman on purchase price adjustments related to the sale of its EIS business
whereby Aerojet reduced the purchase price by $6&nbsp;million. The purchase price
reduction was recorded as an unusual expense item in segment operating profit
for the second quarter of 2002. The Company recorded an unusual expense item of
$1&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2002 for the write-off of bank fees
associated with the termination of Term Loan C.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2001, as discussed above and in Note 3 to Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company reacquired the minority
ownership interest in its AFC subsidiary and certain agreements between AFC and
the minority ownership interest holder were terminated. The net result of the
transaction was an unusual expense item of $2&nbsp;million in the first quarter of
2002.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recorded a charge in earnings from continuing operations of
$19&nbsp;million during the second quarter of 2001 related to a restructuring and
consolidation of its GDX Automotive segment. The restructuring program included
the closure of the Marion, Indiana and Ballina, Ireland manufacturing
facilities and resulted in the elimination of approximately 760 employee
positions. The decision to close these facilities was precipitated by excess
capacity and deterioration of performance and losses at these sites. The
decision to close the Ballina, Ireland plant was also due to difficulty in
retaining plant personnel in light of record employment levels in the region.
Remaining programs from these facilities were transferred to other facilities.

outstanding claims with the Internal Revenue Service and the State of
California. The benefit of the tax refunds, $4&nbsp;million on an after tax basis,
was recorded in the income tax provision in the second quarter. The portion of
the tax refunds that will be repaid to the Company&#146;s defense customers is
reflected as an unusual expense item of $2&nbsp;million in segment income ($1

<P><FONT size="2"><I>Environmental Matters</I>
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GenCorp&#146;s policy is to conduct its businesses with due regard for the
preservation and protection of the environment. The Company devotes a
significant amount of resources and management attention to environmental
matters and actively manages its ongoing processes to comply with extensive
environmental laws and regulations. The Company is involved in the remediation
of environmental conditions that resulted from generally accepted manufacturing
and disposal practices in the 1950&#146;s and 1960&#146;s followed at certain GenCorp
plants. In addition, the Company has been designated a PRP with other companies
at third party sites undergoing investigation and remediation.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of GenCorp&#146;s environmental liabilities relate to its Aerojet
business. Aerojet has executed agreements for substantial cost recovery from
the U.S. Government. In addition, Aerojet will be reimbursed for allowable site
restoration costs at the BPOU via a pass through recovery agreement with
Northrop Grumman. The company currently estimates that expenditures for
environmental compliance and protection will range between $48&nbsp;million and $52
million in 2002.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2002, the Company announced that Aerojet had signed a definitive
agreement settling environmental claims related to the BPOU. The claims and the
agreement are discussed in Note 8(b) to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of environmental investigation and cleanup activities often
makes it difficult to determine the timing and amount of any estimated future
costs that may be required for remediation measures. The Company reviews these
matters and accrues for costs associated with the environmental remediation
when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
the Company&#146;s liability can be reasonably estimated. The Company&#146;s Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet (which are included in Part I, Item&nbsp;1 of
this report) as of August&nbsp;31, 2002 reflects accruals of $346&nbsp;million and
amounts recoverable of $235&nbsp;million from the U.S. Government and other third
parties for such costs. Pursuant to U.S. Government procurement regulations and
a Global Settlement covering environmental contamination at the Company&#146;s
Sacramento and Azusa, California sites, Aerojet can recover a substantial
portion of its environmental costs for its Aerospace and Defense segment
through the establishment of prices for the Company&#146;s

sold to the U.S. Government. The ability of Aerojet to continue recovering
these costs from the U.S. Government depends on Aerojet&#146;s sustained business
volume under U.S. Government contracts and programs and is subject to the
limitations of the Northrop Grumman agreement. The adjustment to the
environmental remediation reserves and estimated future recoveries did not
affect operating results for the quarter. Aerojet&#146;s net environmental
obligation, the excess of environmental reserves over future cost recoveries,
was $111&nbsp;million at August&nbsp;31, 2002 and May&nbsp;31, 2002.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the final resolution of environmental matters and Aerojet&#146;s
obligations for environmental remediation and compliance cannot be predicted
due to the uncertainty concerning both the amount and timing of future
expenditures due to regulatory or technological changes. However, management
believes, on the basis of presently available information, that the resolution
of environmental matters and the Company&#146;s obligations for environmental
remediation and compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company&#146;s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. The Company
will continue its efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of
claims for recoveries from insurance coverage and other PRPs and continued
investigation of new and more cost effective remediation alternatives and
associated technologies.

revolving credit facility was $137&nbsp;million (excluding outstanding letters of
credit of $22&nbsp;million), of which the Company had drawn-down $60&nbsp;million. The
average interest rate on the outstanding balance of the revolving credit
facility was 4.6&nbsp;percent as of August&nbsp;31, 2002. As of August&nbsp;31, 2002 the
outstanding Term Loan A balance was $76&nbsp;million and the interest rate was 4.4
percent. As of August&nbsp;31, 2002, pursuant to Amendment No.&nbsp;2, the scheduled
repayments remaining on Term Loan A are ten equal quarterly principal payments
of $5&nbsp;million through December 2004, and four equal quarterly payments of $7

Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes at any time on or after 90
days following the date on which the notes were originally issued. Interest
accrues on the Notes at a rate of 5.75&nbsp;percent per annum payable October&nbsp;15 and
April&nbsp;15. The Notes are redeemable at the option of the holder upon a change of
control and at the option of the Company if the closing price of the Company&#146;s
Common Stock exceeds 125&nbsp;percent of the conversion price then in effect for at

                                  GENCORP INC.
                   1999 EQUITY AND PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN

                           RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT




            WHEREAS, ________________________ (the "Grantee") is an employee of
GenCorp Inc. (the "Company") or a Subsidiary; and

            WHEREAS, the execution of a restricted stock agreement in the form
hereof (the "Agreement") has been authorized by a resolution of the Organization
and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the
"Board") of the Company duly adopted on _________________________;

            NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to the Company's 1999 Equity and
Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), the Company grants, as of
___________________________ (the "Date of Grant"), to the Grantee
____________________ (_______) shares of the Company's common stock, par value
$0.10 per share (the "Stock"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan
and the following terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions:

         1. ISSUANCE OF STOCK. The Stock covered by this Agreement shall be
fully paid and nonassessable and shall be represented by certificates registered
in the name of the Grantee and bearing a legend referring to the restrictions
hereinafter set forth.

         2. RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF STOCK. The Stock subject to this
Agreement may not be transferred, sold, pledged, exchanged, assigned or
otherwise encumbered or disposed of by the Grantee, except to the Company, until
it has become vested in accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement; provided,
however, that the Grantee's interest in the Stock covered by this Agreement may
be transferred at any time by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any
purported transfer, encumbrance or other disposition of the Stock covered by
this Agreement that is in violation of this Section will be null and void, and
the other party to any such purported transaction will not obtain any rights to
or interest in the Stock covered by this Agreement. When and as permitted by the
Plan, the Company may waive the restrictions set forth in this Section with
respect to all or any portion of the Stock covered by this Agreement.

         3. VESTING OF STOCK. (a) Provided that the Grantee remains in the
continuous employ of the Company or a Subsidiary, the Stock covered by this
Agreement will become nonforfeitable immediately upon achievement of the Target
Price, as follows:



<PAGE>






                                                        Percent Nonforfeitable
                                                        ----------------------

           Achievement of the Target Price                       100%
           no later than ___________________
           (three years from date of grant)

           Achievement of the Target Price                        50%
           after _______________ (three years
           from date of grant) and no
           later than ______________________
           (four years from date of grant)

The Target Price will be achieved if, and only if, the Market Value (as defined
in the Plan) for shares of the Stock is $19.00 or higher for ten (10)
consecutive days on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading.

            (b) For the purposes of this Agreement, the continuous employment of
the Grantee with the Company or a Subsidiary shall not be deemed to have been
interrupted, and the Grantee will not be deemed to have ceased to be an employee
of the Company or a Subsidiary, by reason of (A) the transfer of his employment
among the Company and its Subsidiaries or (B) an approved leave of absence.

            (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (a) of this
Section, in the event of the death, disability or retirement of the Grantee: (i)
any of the Stock covered by this Agreement that has become nonforfeitable prior
to the death, disability or retirement of the Grantee shall remain
nonforfeitable; and, (ii) the Committee will consider whether, in its sole
discretion, to accelerate pursuant to Section 17(e) of the Plan the vesting of
any or all of the Stock subject to this Agreement which remains subject to
forfeiture. For purposes of this Agreement, "Retirement" of the Grantee shall
mean normal or early retirement under the defined benefit retirement plan of the
Company applicable to the Grantee (as determined by the Committee).

            (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (a) of this
Section, all of the Stock covered by this Agreement will become immediately
nonforfeitable upon the occurrence of a change in control of the Company that
shall occur while the Grantee is an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary. For
the purposes of this Agreement, the term "change in control" will have the
meaning given such term under the Plan as in effect on the Date of Grant.

         4. FORFEITURE OF STOCK. Unless the Committee determines to provide
otherwise, any of the Stock covered by this Agreement that has not become vested
in accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement will be forfeited as follows:

         (i)      Fifty percent (50%) of the shares of Stock covered by this
                  Agreement will be forfeited if the Target Price is not
                  achieved before ______________ (three years, plus one day,
                  after date of grant); and

         (ii)     The remaining fifty percent (50%) of the shares of Stock
                  covered by the Agreement will be forfeited if the Target Price
                  is not achieved before ___________________________________
                  (four years, plus one day, after date of grant).




<PAGE>

In the event of a forfeiture, the certificates representing all of the Stock
covered by this Agreement that has not become vested in accordance with Section
3 of this Agreement shall be cancelled.

        5. DIVIDEND, VOTING AND OTHER RIGHTS. The Grantee will have all of the
rights of a shareholder with respect to the Stock covered by this Agreement,
including the right to vote the Stock and receive any dividends that may be paid
thereon. Any additional Stock that the Grantee may become entitled to receive
pursuant to a share dividend or a merger or reorganization in which the Company
is the surviving Company or any other change in the capital structure of the
Company will be subject to the same restrictions as the Stock covered by this
Agreement.

        6. RETENTION OF SHARE CERTIFICATES BY COMPANY. The certificates
representing the Stock covered by this Agreement will be held in custody by the
Company, together with stock powers endorsed in blank by the Grantee with
respect thereto, until those shares have become vested in accordance with
Section 3 of this Agreement.

        7. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. The Company will make reasonable efforts to
comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws; provided, however,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company will not be
obligated to issue any restricted or unrestricted Stock pursuant to this
Agreement if the issuance thereof would result in a violation of any such law.

        8. ADJUSTMENTS. The Committee will make any adjustments in the number or
kind of shares of stock or other securities covered by this Agreement that the
Committee may determine to be equitably required to prevent any dilution or
enlargement of the Grantee's rights under this Agreement that would result from
any (a) stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or
other change in the capital structure of the Company, (b) merger, consolidation,
spin-off, spin-out, split-off, split-up, reorganization, partial or complete
liquidation or other distribution of assets, issuance of rights or warrants to
purchase securities or (c) other corporate transaction or event having an effect
similar to any of the foregoing.

        9. WITHHOLDING. To the extent that the Company is required to withhold
federal, state, local or foreign taxes in connection with any issuance of
restricted or unrestricted Stock or other securities pursuant to this Agreement,
and the amounts available to the Company for such withholding are insufficient,
it will be a condition to the receipt of such Stock that the Grantee make
arrangements satisfactory to the Company for payment of the balance of such
taxes required to be withheld. If necessary, the Committee may require
relinquishment of a portion of such Stock to cover the payment of taxes.

        10. EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS. The Plan and this Agreement will not confer upon
the Grantee any right with respect to the continuance of employment or other
service with the Company or any Subsidiary and will not interfere in any way
with any right that the Company or any Subsidiary would otherwise have to
terminate any employment or other service of the Grantee at any time.


<PAGE>


        11. RELATION TO OTHER BENEFITS. Any economic or other benefit to the
Grantee under this Agreement will not be taken into account in determining any
benefits to which the Grantee may be entitled under any profit-sharing,
retirement or other benefit or compensation plan maintained by the Company or a
Subsidiary and shall not affect the amount of any life insurance coverage
available to any beneficiary under any life insurance plan covering employees of
the Company or a Subsidiary.

        12. AGREEMENT SUBJECT TO THE PLAN. The Stock granted under this
Agreement and all of the terms and conditions hereof are subject to all of the
terms and conditions of the Plan. In the event of any inconsistency between this
Agreement and the Plan, the terms of the Plan will govern.

        13. AMENDMENTS. Any amendment to the Plan will be deemed to be an
amendment to this Agreement to the extent that the amendment is applicable
hereto; provided, however, that no amendment will adversely affect the rights of
the Grantee under this Agreement without the Grantee's consent.

        14. SEVERABILITY. In the event that one or more of the provisions of
this Agreement is invalidated for any reason by a court of competent
jurisdiction, any provision so invalidated shall be deemed to be separable from
the other provisions hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof will continue
to be valid and fully enforceable.

        15. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement will be construed and governed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio.

        16. CERTAIN DEFINED TERMS. In addition to the terms defined elsewhere
herein, when used in the Agreement, terms with initial capital letters have the
meaning given such term under the Plan, as in effect from time to time.

            This Agreement is executed as of the _____ day of ________________.

                                     GENCORP INC.

                                   ARTICLE III
                                 PURCHASE PRICE

      3.1 Initial Purchase Price. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, the Purchaser will deliver to the
Seller Ninety Million Dollars $90,000,000 (the "Initial Purchase Price") by bank
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing
by the Seller. The Initial Purchase Price will be subject to adjustment as
provided in Section 3.2.

      3.2 Post-Closing Adjustment of Initial Purchase Price.

         (a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Seller will deliver to
the Purchaser (i) a balance sheet of the Business as of the Closing Date (the
"Closing Date Balance Sheet")


                                       9
<PAGE>
prepared in accordance with GAAP, using the same accounting methods, policies,
practices and procedures and applied on a basis consistent with that employed by
the Seller in the preparation of the Financial Statements, (ii) a schedule of
working capital of the Business as of the Closing Date (the "Statement of
Closing Date Working Capital") setting forth the working capital of the Business
as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Working Capital"), calculated by
subtracting (x) total current liabilities minus the amount calculated pursuant
to Schedule 3.2 from the sum of (y) accounts receivable, contracts in progress
and inventories, and (iii) a certificate signed by Seller's Accounting Firm (the
"Auditor's Report") together with the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
Statement of Closing Date Working Capital to which such Auditor's Report
relates. The Auditor's Report will report, without qualification or other
limitation arising out of the scope of the audit, that the Closing Date Balance
Sheet presents fairly the financial position of the Business as of the Closing
Date in conformity with GAAP, except the Closing Date Balance Sheet will not
give effect to any purchase accounting adjustments arising from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

         (b) Within 30 days after the receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet,
the Statement of Closing Date Working Capital and the Auditor's Report, the
Purchaser will deliver written notice to the Seller of any objections thereto,
and will attempt in good faith to reach an agreement with the Seller as to any
matters in dispute. If the Purchaser and the Seller, notwithstanding such good
faith effort, fail to resolve all matters in dispute within 30 days after the
Purchaser advises the Seller of its objections, then any remaining disputed
matters will be finally and conclusively determined by an independent auditing
firm of recognized national standing (the "Arbiter") selected by the Purchaser
and the Seller. Promptly, but not later than 30 days after its acceptance of its
appointment, the Arbiter will determine (based solely on presentations by the
Seller and the Purchaser and not by independent review) only those matters in
dispute and will render a written report as to the disputed matters and the
resulting calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital, which report will be
conclusive and binding upon the parties. The fees and expenses of the Arbiter
will be shared equally by the Purchaser and the Seller.

         (c) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth herein, each
party will cooperate with and make available to the other party and its auditors
and representatives all information, records and data, and will permit access to
its facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably required in connection with
the preparation and analysis of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Statement of
Closing Date Working Capital and all related information and the resolution of
any disputes thereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Seller will cause Seller's Accounting Firm to make available at its office to
the Purchaser and the Purchaser's Accounting Firm within 10 business days after
delivery of the Auditor's Report pursuant to Section 3.2(a) the workpapers
therefor.

         (d) In the event that the Closing Date Working Capital, as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 3.2, is (i) less than $11,700,000, then the
Seller will pay to the Purchaser the amount of such difference or (ii) greater
than $16,700,000, then the Purchaser will pay to the Seller the amount of such
difference. Any payment pursuant to this Section 3.2(d) will be made in cash
plus interest thereon (calculated based on the actual number of days elapsed in
a year consisting of 365 days) from the Closing Date to the date of such payment
at the per annum rate equal to the rate announced by Citibank, N.A. in the City
of New York as its prime rate as in effect on the Closing Date. Any payment
pursuant to this Section 3.2(d) will be made within five business days following
the final determination of the Closing Date Working Capital in accordance with
this Section 3.2 by bank wire transfer of immediately available funds to an


                                       10
<PAGE>
account designated in writing by the Seller or the Purchaser, as the case may
be. The payment pursuant to this Section 3.2 (other than the portion thereof
that is attributable to the payment of interest pursuant to this Section 3.2(d))
will be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price
and the Initial Purchase Price as so adjusted will be referred to in this
Agreement as the "Purchase Price."

      3.3 Allocation of Purchase Price.

         (a) Within 120 days after the Closing Date, the Seller will deliver to
the Purchaser a preliminary allocation among the Purchased Assets of the
Purchase Price and among such other consideration paid to the Seller pursuant to
this Agreement; and as soon as practicable following the Closing, the Seller
will deliver to the Purchaser a statement (the "Allocation Statement") setting
forth its calculation of the amount of the total consideration allocable to the
Purchased Assets sold at the Closing.

         (b) The Allocation Statement will be prepared in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

         (c) The Purchaser will review the Allocation Statement and, to the
extent the Purchaser disagrees in good faith with the content of the Allocation
Statement, the Purchaser will inform the Seller of such disagreement within 30
days after receipt of the Allocation Statement. The Seller and the Purchaser
will attempt to resolve any such disagreement. If the Seller and the Purchaser
are unable to reach a good faith agreement on the content of the Allocation
Statement within 180 days of the Closing Date, the Seller and the Purchaser will
each use their respective allocation statements.

         (d) If the Purchaser and the Seller agree on the Allocation Statement,
the Purchaser and the Seller will report the allocation of the total
consideration among the Purchased Assets in a manner consistent with the
Allocation Statement and will act in accordance with the Allocation Statement in
the preparation and timely filing of all Income Tax returns (including filing
Form 8594 with their respective federal income tax returns for the taxable year
that includes the Closing and any other forms or statements required by the
Code, Treasury regulations, the Internal Revenue Service or any applicable state
or local taxing authority). Each of the Purchaser and the Seller agrees to
promptly provide the other party with any additional information and reasonable
assistance required to complete Form 8594 or compute Taxes arising in connection
with (or otherwise affected by) the transactions contemplated hereunder.

         (e) The Purchaser and the Seller will promptly inform one another of
any challenge by any taxing authority to any allocation made pursuant to this
Section 3.3 and agree to consult with and keep one another informed with respect
to the status of, and any discussion, proposal or submission with respect to,
such challenge.

      7.10 Survey. At the Purchaser's option and upon request, the Seller will,
and will cause the Business to, use commercially reasonable efforts to assist
the Purchaser in obtaining, at the Purchaser's expense, prior to the Closing a
survey of the Owned Real Property.

      7.11 Estoppel Certificates. The Seller will make commercially reasonably
efforts to obtain estoppel certificates from the landlords with respect to the
Leased Real Property.


      Post-Closing Covenants. With respect to the covenants set forth in
Sections 7.12 through 7.19 of this Article VII, the Purchaser and the Seller
agree as follows:

      7.12 General. In case at any time after the Closing Date any further
action is reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each
of the parties will take such further action (including the execution and
delivery of such further instruments and documents) as the other party
reasonably may request, at the sole cost and expense of the requesting party
(unless otherwise specified herein or unless the requesting party is entitled to
indemnification therefor under Article X).

      7.13 Post-Closing Consents; Nonassignable Contracts.

            (a) The Seller and the Purchaser each will use its reasonable
commercial efforts after the Closing Date to obtain all consents, approvals or
authorizations of any Governmental Entities or third parties that are not
obtained prior to the Closing Date and that are required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that neither the Seller
nor the Purchaser will be required to make any expenditures or incur any
liability to obtain any third party consent required in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            (b) To the extent that any Contract is not capable of being
transferred by the Seller to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement without
the consent of a third party (including a Governmental Entity) and such consent
is not obtained prior to Closing, or if such transfer or attempted transfer
would constitute a breach or a violation of the Contract or any Law, nothing in
this Agreement will constitute a transfer or an attempted transfer thereof.

            (c) In the event that any required consent is not obtained on or
prior to the Closing Date, the Seller will use reasonable commercial efforts to
(i) provide to the Purchaser the benefits of the applicable Contract (and the
Seller and the Purchaser will share equally any expenses related thereto), (ii)
cooperate in any reasonable and lawful arrangement designed to provide such
benefits to the Purchaser and (iii) enforce at the request and expense of the
Purchaser and for the account of the Purchaser, any rights of the Seller arising
from any such Contract (including the right to elect to terminate such Contract
in accordance with the terms thereof upon the request of the Purchaser).

            (d) To the extent that the Purchaser is provided the benefits of any
Contract referred to in Section 7.13(c), the Purchaser will perform the
obligations arising under such Contract for the benefit of the Seller and the
other party or parties thereto, except for any obligation under such Contract
that constitutes an Excluded Liability.

      7.14 Novation of Government Contracts. Following the Closing, the Seller
will, in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the Federal Acquisition
Regulation Part 42, Subpart 42.12, submit in writing to each responsible
contracting officer a request of the U.S.

                                       26
<PAGE>
Government or Governmental Entity as the case may be, to (a) recognize the
Purchaser as the successor in interest to all of the Government Contracts and
(b) enter into a novation agreement (the "Novation Agreement") substantially in
the form contemplated by such regulations. The Seller will use reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain all consents, approvals and waivers required for
the purpose of processing, entering into and completing the Novation Agreements
with regard to the Government Contracts, including responding to any reasonable
request for information by the U.S. Government with regard to such Novation
Agreements. The Purchaser will use reasonable commercial efforts to provide all
information and take all other actions reasonably necessary to execute and
consummate such Novation Agreements, including responding promptly to any
request for information by the U.S. Government with regard to such Novation
Agreements.

      7.15 Litigation Support. In the event and for so long as any party is
actively contesting or defending against any third-party charge, complaint,
action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, claim or demand in connection
with (a) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (b) any fact,
situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act or transaction on or prior
to the Closing Date involving the Business, the other party will cooperate with
the contesting or defending party and its counsel in the contest or defense,
make available its personnel and provide such testimony and access to its books
and records as may be necessary in connection with the contest or defense, at
the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending party (unless the
contesting or defending party is entitled to indemnification therefor under
Article X).

      7.16 Agreements Regarding Tax Matters.

            (a) The Seller and the Purchaser will provide each other with such
assistance and information relating to the Business and the Purchased Assets as
may reasonably be requested in connection with the preparation of any Tax
Return, audit or other examination by any taxing authority or judicial or
administrative proceeding relating to liability for Taxes, and will each retain
and provide to the other party all records and other information which may be
relevant to any such Tax Return, audit or examination, proceeding or
determination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the
Purchaser and the Seller will retain, until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitation (including any extensions thereof) copies of all Tax
Returns, supporting work schedules and other records relating to the Business
and the Purchased Assets for tax periods or portions thereof ending prior to or
on the Closing Date.

            (b) The Seller and the Purchaser agree that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement constitute a sale of a trade or business within
the meaning of Section 41(f)(3) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. The
Seller agrees to provide the Purchaser upon request with the information
necessary to permit the Purchaser to apply the provisions of Section 41(f)(3) of
the Code.

            (c) If, prior to the Closing, the Seller has paid any Tax relating
to any Purchased Asset for any taxable period that includes (but does not end
on) the Closing Date, Purchaser will reimburse the Seller for such payment on a
pro rata basis determined by the number of days in such taxable period beginning
on and after the Closing Date divided by the total number of days in such
taxable period. If, after the Closing, the Purchaser pays any Tax relating to
any Purchased Asset for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date, the Seller will reimburse the Purchaser for such payment on a
pro rata basis determined by the number of days in such taxable period prior to
(but not including) the Closing Date divided by

                                       27
<PAGE>
the total number of days in such taxable period. The Seller will exercise
exclusive control over the handling, disposition and settlement of any
governmental inquiry, examination, or proceeding that could result in a
determination with respect to Taxes due or payable by the Purchaser for which
the Seller may be liable or against which the Seller may be required to
indemnify the Purchaser. The Purchaser will notify the Seller in writing
promptly upon learning of any such inquiry, examination or proceeding. The
Purchaser will cooperate with the Seller, as the Seller may reasonably request,
in any such inquiry, examination or proceeding. The Purchaser will not extend
the statute of limitations for any Tax for which the Seller may be required to
indemnify the Purchaser without the Seller's permission.

            (d) If the Purchaser receives a refund with respect to Taxes arising
in a period prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser will pay, within 30 days
following the receipt of such Tax refund, the amount of such Tax refund to the
Seller.

            (e) The Purchaser and the Seller will not agree to settle any Tax
liability or compromise any claim with respect to Taxes which settlement or
compromise may affect the liability for Taxes hereunder (or right to tax
benefit) of the other party, without such other party's consent, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

      7.17 Records and Documents. Following the Closing Date, the Seller will
grant to the Purchaser and its representatives, at the Purchaser's reasonable
request, reasonable access to and the right to make copies at the Purchaser's
sole expense of those records and documents in the Seller's possession related
to the Business or the Purchased Assets as may be reasonably necessary for the
Purchaser's operation of the Business after the Closing and which do not
constitute Purchased Assets. Following the Closing Date, the Purchaser will
grant to the Seller and its representatives, at the Seller's reasonable request,
reasonable access to and the right to make copies at the Seller's sole expense
of those records and documents covering any period prior to the Closing related
to the Business or the Purchased Assets as may be reasonably necessary for
third-party litigation, preparation of financial statements, tax returns and
audits or other valid business purposes. If the Purchaser elects to dispose of
any of such records within six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
will first give the Seller 60 days' written notice, during which period the
Seller will have the right to take such records without payment of
consideration.

      7.18 Use of Excluded Trademarks. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Section 7.18, no interest in or right to use the names and marks
constituting Excluded Assets (the "Excluded Trademarks") is being conveyed
pursuant to this Agreement. As promptly as practicable following the Closing,
but in no event later than 90 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will
remove or cover all Excluded Trademarks that appear on any Purchased Asset,
including without limitation, signs, promotional or advertising literature,
labels, stationery, office forms and packaging materials. Neither the Purchaser
nor its Affiliates will in any way use any Excluded Trademark, or use any
trademark, tradename, service mark, brand name, tradedress or logo that is
likely to cause confusion with any of the Excluded Trademarks or be associated
with the Seller or its Affiliates on or as of the Closing Date after the Closing
Date, except pursuant to this Section 7.18.

      7.19 Non-Competition.

            (a) Seller agrees that, for a period commencing on the Closing Date
and terminating two years after the Closing Date, it will not directly, or
indirectly through any of its Affiliates,

                                       28
<PAGE>
engage in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling or distributing
products designed, manufactured, sold or distributed by the Business as of the
date of this Agreement, anywhere in the world. The foregoing activities are
referred to in this Agreement collectively as "Business Activities."

            (b) Notwithstanding the above, the provisions of Section 7.19(a)
will not prohibit any of the Seller's Affiliates from engaging in any business
currently conducted by such Affiliate and any natural extensions thereof.

            (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.19(a), the
acquisition (by asset purchase, stock purchase, merger, consolidation or
otherwise) by the Seller or any of its Affiliates of the stock, business or
assets of any Person that at the time of such acquisition is engaged in Business
Activities, and the continuation of such Business Activities following such
acquisition, will not be in breach of the terms of this Section 7.19 if: (i) the
portion of the revenues of such Person and its subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis for the fiscal year ending prior to the date of such acquisition that is
attributable to Business Activities by such Person and its subsidiaries account
for less than 20% of the revenues of such Person and its subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis for such fiscal year; or (ii) in the event the foregoing
condition is not satisfied, the Seller offers, or cause its Affiliates to offer
the portion of such business or assets that represents Business Activities to
the Purchaser and negotiates in good faith with the Purchaser as to the terms
and conditions of the Purchaser's purchase of such business and assets.

            (d) Nothing in this Section 7.19 will restrict or prevent the Seller
or any of its Affiliates from maintaining and/or undertaking passive investments
in Persons primarily engaged in the Business Activities so long as the aggregate
interest represented by such investments does not exceed (i) five percent (5%)
of any class of the outstanding debt or equity securities of any such Person, in
the case of a Person whose shares are listed on a national securities exchange
or the NASDAQ National Market System or equivalent foreign exchange or quotation
system or (ii) five percent (5%) of any class of the outstanding equity or debt
securities in the case of any other Person.

            (e) If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of this Section 7.19 is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability will have the power to reduce the scope, duration
or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to
replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision
that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention
of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision and this Agreement will be
enforceable as so modified.

      7.20 Non-Solicitation of Employees. For a period commencing on the Closing
Date and terminating two years after the Closing Date, (a) except for Business
Employees, the Purchaser will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, solicit
any employee of the Seller for employment by the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates without the prior written consent of the Seller, and (b) the Seller
will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, solicit any employee of the
Business for employment by the Seller or any of its Affiliates, without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, an employee
will be deemed not to have been solicited for employment if (i) such employee or
its agent has initiated any communication or contact for the purpose of
discussing any potential employment of such employee or (ii) such employee
responds to a general public advertisement or other general solicitation of
employment. Nothing


                                       29
<PAGE>
herein will prohibit either of the parties or any of their respective Affiliates
from employing or offering to employ any employee if such employee was not
solicited for employment.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                EMPLOYEE MATTERS

         8.1      Employment.

                  (a) The Purchaser will offer to each of the Business Employees
employed with the Seller on the Closing Date employment in the same or
comparable position as provided by the Seller as of the Closing Date. From the
Closing Date through November 30, 2003, such Business Employees will receive the
same or comparable compensation, salary or wage rate, plus the same or
comparable bonus opportunities while they remain employees of the Purchaser.
Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Purchaser will assume and
thereafter pay, perform and discharge any and all employment, compensation and
Seller Employee Benefit Plan liabilities, whether arising prior to, on or after
the Closing Date, with respect to the Business Employees as of the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the preceding sentence will not apply to any
benefits arising prior to the Closing Date that are fully insured.

                  (b) Notwithstanding language to the contrary contained herein,
the term "Business Employee" will not include any employee of the Business
absent from work due to long-term disability as of the Closing Date and listed
separately on Schedule 8.1; provided that, in the event any such individual
presents himself or herself for active employment to the Purchaser during the
one-year period following the Closing Date, he or she will be treated as a
Business Employee under this Agreement as of his or her date of presentation.

                  (c) Notwithstanding language to the contrary contained herein,
this Agreement will not constitute a contract of employment and will not give
any Business Employee a right to be retained in the employ of either the Seller
or the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates.

         8.2      Employee Benefit Matters.

                  (a) As of the Closing Date, Business Employees will cease
participation in the Seller Employee Benefit Plans and fringe benefit programs.
Effective as of the Closing Date and continuing for a period ending no earlier
than November 30, 2003, the Purchaser will provide to the Business Employees
through Purchaser Employee Benefit Plans and fringe benefit programs (including,
as applicable, sick pay, vacation pay and tuition reimbursement programs),
employee benefits which are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to the
employee benefits provided to the Business Employees under Seller Employee
Benefit Plans and fringe benefit programs as of the Closing Date.

                  (b) In addition to the foregoing: (i) coverage under such
Purchaser Employee Benefit Plans will be sufficient to eliminate any liability
of the Seller to the Business Employees for any benefits under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA); and (ii) the Purchaser will
assume all accrued vacation liabilities for personal time off and other vacation
and sick leave of the Business Employees as of the Closing Date, provided such
liabilities are adequately reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet.

                  (c) Effective as of the Closing Date and continuing for a
period ending no earlier than November 30, 2003, the Purchaser will provide each
Business Employee with severance


                                       30
<PAGE>
benefits under a Purchaser plan that are substantially comparable to the
severance benefits provided to each such Business Employee as of the Closing
Date.

                  (d) The Purchaser will assume the Seller's obligations with
respect to all of the agreements with Business Employees listed in Schedule
8.2(d).

                  (e) The Purchaser will assume and become solely responsible
for all obligations and liabilities of the Seller under all Employee Welfare
Benefit Plans providing for post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits
with respect to all Business Employees and former employees of the Business and
their eligible dependents and will be responsible for all liabilities with
respect to such benefits whether accrued before, on or after the Closing Date.
Schedule 8.2(e) of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth a list of former
employees eligible for such benefits. As of the Closing Date and continuing for
a period ending no earlier than November 30, 2003, the Purchaser will continue
such post-retirement and life insurance benefits at the benefit levels in effect
on the Closing Date. As part of the indemnification to the Seller provided under
Section 10.3, the Purchaser will indemnify the Seller for any Losses the Seller
may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to or caused by any change,
modification or termination of such post-retirement benefits following the
Closing Date.

                  (f) Solely for purposes of eligibility and vesting under the
Employee Benefit Plans of the Purchaser providing benefits to any employee or
former employee of the Business after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will cause
each employee or former employee of the Business to be credited with his or her
years of service with the Seller (and any predecessor entities thereof) before
the Closing Date, to the same extent as such employee or former employee was
entitled, as of the Closing Date, to credit for such service under any similar
Seller Employee Benefit Plan.

                  (g) Following the Closing Date, the Purchaser will (i) waive
any pre-existing condition limitation under any Employee Welfare Benefit Plan
maintained by the Purchaser in which employees or former employees of the
Business and their eligible dependents participate (except to the extent that
such pre-existing condition limitation would have been applicable immediately
prior to the Closing Date under the comparable Employee Welfare Benefit Plans of
the Seller) and (ii) provide each employee or former employee of the Business
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles incurred by any of them prior to
the Closing Date in order to satisfy any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any Welfare Benefit Plans in which any of the employees or
former employees of the Business participate after the Closing Date.

                  (h) The Seller will retain responsibility for its liabilities
and obligations under the Management Security Plan.

                  (i) The Purchaser will assume the Seller's obligations to pay
the Business Employees their bonus banks under the Management Incentive/Bonus
Plan in accordance with its terms as of the Closing Date, provided such
liabilities are adequately reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet.

                  (j) As of the Closing Date, the Seller will cause the portion
of its flexible reimbursement plan applicable to Business Employees to be
segregated into a separate component and all account balances of such employees
in the flexible reimbursement plan will be transferred to a flexible
reimbursement plan that the Purchaser will cause to be maintained for the
duration of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs.

         8.3 Allocation of Pension Plan Responsibilities. With respect to any
Employee Pension Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code, maintained by or for the benefit of any of the Business Employees, the
Seller and the Purchaser agree as follows:

                  (a) the Seller will retain all liabilities attributable to
accrued benefits under the Seller's qualified Employee Pension Benefit Plan(s).
The Purchaser will have no liability of any kind with respect to benefits
accrued under any of such plans;

                  (b) as of the Closing Date, the Seller will cause all such
qualified Employee Pension Benefit Plans maintained by the Seller to cease any
and all accruals thereunder with respect to the Business Employees;

                  (c) the Seller will cause all Business Employees to be fully
vested in their account balances in the Seller's defined contribution plan; and

                  (d) following the Closing Date, the Business Employees will be
permitted to roll over their account balances in the Seller's defined
contribution plan (or any portion thereof) to the Purchaser's defined
contribution plan, including the ability to rollover any existing loans under
such Seller plan for 90 days after the Closing Date.

                                   ARTICLE IX

survival period, then the Seller will indemnify the Purchaser from and against
the entirety of any losses, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney's,
accountant's and expert's fees and expenses), damages and other liabilities
reduced by any income tax benefits (collectively, "Losses") suffered or incurred
by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or any of their respective
stockholders, directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the
"Purchaser Indemnified Parties"), resulting from, arising out of, relating to or
caused by: (i) any breach or non-performance by the Seller of any covenant or
agreement of the Seller contained in this Agreement or, prior to their
expiration in accordance with Section 10.1, the inaccuracy of any representation
or the breach of any warranty of the Seller contained in this Agreement, or
contained in any certificate delivered by the Seller relating thereto; (ii) the
Excluded Liabilities; (iii) any non-compliance by the Seller with bulk sales or
transfer laws as provided in Section 12.3; or (iv) any breach or non-performance
by the Seller of any Ancillary Agreement.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.2, the Seller
will have no obligation to indemnify the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise:

                           (i) with respect to incidental, special, punitive or
consequential damages, including consequential damages consisting of business
interruption or lost profits;


                                       34
<PAGE>
                           (ii) with respect to any claim by or liability to any
Business Employee arising as the result of the termination of such employee's
employment with the Purchaser or any other action by the Purchaser subsequent to
the Closing Date; or

                           (iii) any Losses to the extent such Losses are
covered by the Title Policy.

         10.3 Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of the Seller.

                  (a) Provided that the Seller makes a written claim for
indemnification against the Purchaser, then the Purchaser agrees to indemnify
the Seller from and against the entirety of any Losses the Seller may suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to or caused by: (i) any breach or
non-performance by the Purchaser of any covenant or agreement of the Purchaser
contained in this Agreement or, prior to their expiration in accordance with
Section 10.1, the inaccuracy of any representation or the breach of any warranty
of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement, or contained in any certificate
delivered by the Purchaser relating thereto; (ii) the Assumed Liabilities
(subject to Section 10.5 below); or (iii) any breach or non-performance by the
Purchaser of any Ancillary Agreement.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.3, the
Purchaser will have no obligation to indemnify the Seller with respect to
incidental, special, punitive or consequential damages, including consequential
damages consisting of business interruption or lost profits.

         10.4 Limitation on Indemnification Obligation.

                  (a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller will not be
required to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser for Losses arising under
Section 10.2(a)(i) or Section 10.2(a)(iv) until, and then only to the extent
that, the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds $2,000,000 (the "Basket
Amount"), after which point the Seller will be obligated to indemnify and hold
harmless the Purchaser for all such Losses until the aggregate amount of such
Losses equals $9,000,000 (the "Ceiling Amount"), at which point the Seller will
have no further obligation to indemnify or hold harmless the Purchaser.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser will not be
required to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller for Losses arising under
Section 10.3(a)(i) or Section 10.3(a)(iii) until, and then only to the extent
that, the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds the Basket Amount, after which
point the Purchaser will be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
for all such Losses until the aggregate amount of such Losses equals the Ceiling
Amount, at which point the Purchaser will have no further obligation to
indemnify or hold harmless the Seller.

         10.5 Environmental Indemnification.

                  (a) The Seller will indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser
from and against 50% of all Losses suffered or incurred by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, which (i) result from or arise out of any environmental
liabilities relating to the ownership or operation of the Business or the
Purchased Assets and (ii) arise out of any event, transaction, condition,
practice, Release or occurrence prior to the Closing Date, including any such
liabilities resulting from violations of Environmental Laws in connection with
the generation, storage, presence, use, handling, treatment, transportation,
disposal or Release of any Hazardous Materials prior to the Closing Date. Any
amounts payable by the Seller hereunder will be paid to the Purchaser only upon
the


                                       35
<PAGE>
Seller's receipt of written documentation from the Purchaser evidencing each
expenditure and identifying each Person to whom any payment was made.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller will not be
required to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser for any Losses arising
under Section 10.5(a) until, and then only to the extent that, the aggregate
amount of such Losses exceeds $1,000,000. The Seller's indemnification
obligation under this Section 10.5 is not subject to any cap or limitation as to
the total amount payable to the Purchaser.

         10.6 Matters Involving Third Parties. If any third party notifies any
party hereto (the "Indemnified Party") with respect to any matter which may give
rise to a claim for indemnification against the other party hereto (the
"Indemnifying Party") under this Section 10.6, then the Indemnified Party will
notify the Indemnifying Party thereof promptly and in any event within 15 days
after receiving any written notice from a third party; provided that no delay on
the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party will
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless, and then
solely to the extent that, the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. Once
the Indemnified Party has given notice of the matter to the Indemnifying Party,
the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof; provided, however, (a) the
Indemnifying Party will defend the Indemnified Party against the matter with
counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, (b) the
Indemnified Party may participate in (but not control) such defense with
separate counsel at its sole cost and expense, (c) the Indemnified Party will
not consent to the entry of a judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the matter without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be
withheld or delayed unreasonably) and (d) the Indemnifying Party will not
consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to the matter or enter into any
settlement which does not include a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant
in the matter releases the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect
thereto, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be
withheld or delayed unreasonably). If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the
defense of such claim, the Indemnified Party will have the right to undertake
the defense, opposition, compromise or settlement of such claim, by counsel or
other representatives of its own choosing, on behalf of and for the account and
risk of the Indemnifying Party (subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party
to assume the defense of or opposition to such claim at any time prior to
settlement, compromise or final determination thereof).

         10.7 Determination of Loss. The amount of any Loss will be reduced to
the extent that the Indemnified Party receives any insurance proceeds with
respect to a Loss. If, at any time subsequent to the making of an indemnity
payment, the amount of such indemnity payment is reduced by recovery, settlement
or otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance coverage, or pursuant to any
claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against other Person, the amount of
such reduction, less any costs, expenses or premiums incurred in connection
therewith, will promptly be repaid by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying
Party with respect to such Loss.

         10.8 Exclusive Remedy. In the absence of intentional misrepresentation,
omission or breach of this Agreement, the indemnification provisions set forth
in this Article X will constitute the sole and exclusive recourse and remedy for
monetary damages available to the parties hereto with respect to the breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto.

         10.9 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. All indemnification payments made
pursuant to this Agreement will be treated by the parties as adjustments to the
Purchase Price.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                                   TERMINATION

         11.1 Termination of Agreement. The parties may terminate this Agreement
as provided below:

                  (a) the Purchaser and the Seller may terminate this Agreement
by mutual written consent at any time prior to the Closing;

                  (b) the Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by giving
written notice to the Seller at any time prior to the Closing if the Closing has
not occurred on or before November 30, 2002, by reason of the failure of any
closing condition under Section 9.1 (unless the failure results primarily from
the Purchaser itself breaching any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement); or

                  (c) the Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written
notice to the Purchaser at any time prior to the Closing if the Closing has not
occurred on or before November 30, 2002, by reason of the failure of any closing
condition under Section 9.2 (unless the failure results primarily from the
Seller itself breaching any representation, warranty or covenant contained in
this Agreement).

         11.2 Effect of Termination. If any party terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 11.1, all obligations of the parties hereunder will
terminate without liability of any party to the other party (except for any
liability of any party then in breach), except as may have occurred prior to
such termination and except as specifically set forth in this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE XII
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         12.1 Press Releases and Announcements. No party will issue any press
release or announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement prior
to the Closing Date without the prior approval of the other party, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that any party
may make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by Law (in
which case the disclosing party will advise the other party prior to making such
disclosure).

         12.2 Expenses; Transfer Taxes. Each of the parties hereto will bear all
legal, accounting, investment banking and other expenses incurred by it or on
its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether or not such transactions are consummated. The Purchaser and the Seller
will each pay 50% of all excise, sales, use, transfer, value added,
registration, stamp, recording, documentary, conveyancing, franchise, property,
gains and similar Taxes, levies, charges and recording, filing and other fees
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes") arising by reason of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Seller will file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and, if required
by applicable law, the Purchaser will join in the execution of any Tax Returns
and other documentation at the Seller's request. The Purchaser and the Seller
will each pay 50% of the


                                       37
<PAGE>
premium for the Title Policy, except that the Purchaser will pay the entire cost
of any endorsements to the Title Policy, other than extended coverage
endorsement.

         12.3 Bulk Sales or Transfer Laws. The Purchaser acknowledges that the
Seller may not comply with the provisions of any bulk sales or transfer laws of
any jurisdiction in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without prejudice to its rights under Article X of this Agreement,
the Purchaser hereby waives compliance by the Seller with the provisions of the
bulk sales or transfer laws of all applicable jurisdictions.

         12.4 Remedies. Any party having any rights under any provision of this
Agreement will have all rights and remedies set forth in this Agreement and all
rights and remedies which such party may have been granted at any time under any
other agreement or contract and all of the rights which such party may have
under any Law. Any such party will be entitled to enforce such rights
specifically, without posting a bond or other security, to recover damages by
reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise all
other rights granted by Law.

         12.5 Consent to Amendments. The provisions of this Agreement may be
amended or waived only by a written agreement executed and delivered by the
Seller and the Purchaser. No other course of dealing between the parties to this
Agreement or any delay in exercising any rights hereunder will operate as a
waiver of any rights of such parties.

         12.6 Successors and Assigns. No party hereto may assign or delegate any
of such party's rights or obligations under or in connection with this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, except in the case
of the Purchaser, to its lenders and their respective successors and assigns.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto will be
binding upon and enforceable against the respective successors and assigns of
such party and will be enforceable by and will inure to the benefit of the
respective successors and permitted assigns of such party.

         12.7 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision will be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of
this Agreement.

         12.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two
or more counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more
than one party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one and
the same Agreement.

         12.9 Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings of this Agreement
are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part of this
Agreement.

         12.11 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement will not confer any
rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Seller and the Purchaser and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement
will be construed as giving to any Business Employee or other person any legal
or equitable right against the Seller, the Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates or Employee Benefit Plans or programs.

         12.12 Force Majeure. No party hereto will be liable to the other party
for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement to the extent such failure or delay is caused by a fire, flood,
earthquake, riot, civil disorder, terrorism, war, labor disputes or any other
cause beyond the reasonable control of the party whose performance is delayed or
otherwise affected by such event (each such event, a "Force Majeure Event"). The
party whose performance is affected by a Force Majeure Event will use reasonable
efforts to (a) avoid, remove or minimize the impact of such event on the
performance of its obligations at the required level at the earliest possible
date. If any party is, or anticipates it is likely to be, delayed


                                       39
<PAGE>
or prevented from performing its obligations in connection with a Force Majeure
Event, such party will promptly notify the other party by telephone with
confirmation in writing within two business days after the inception of such
delay.

         12.13 Confidentiality. The Seller agrees that, for a period commencing
on the Closing Date and terminating three years after the Closing Date, it will
keep confidential and will use its best efforts to cause its Affiliates and
representatives to keep confidential (except as may be disclosed to the Seller's
attorneys, accountants, financial advisors or other representatives) all
confidential information relating directly to the Business or the Purchased
Assets that remains in the possession of the Seller or its Affiliates after the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "confidential information" will
not be deemed to include any information which (a) is or becomes generally known
by the public (other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement) or is a
recognized standard industry practice, (c) was or becomes available to the
Seller on a non-confidential basis from a Person who is not known to the Seller
to be legally prohibited from transmitting the information to the Seller or (d)
the Seller can demonstrate, by competent written proof, was independently
developed by the Seller.

         12.14 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents
referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties and
supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among
the parties, written or oral, that may have related in any way to the subject
matter hereof.

         12.15 Construction. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed
to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent and no
rule of strict construction will be applied against any party. The use of the
word "including" in this Agreement means "including without limitation" and is
intended by the parties to be by way of example rather than limitation.

         12.16 Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules. The Exhibits and
Schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and
made a part hereof.

         12.17 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO
ANY LAW OR RULE THAT WOULD CAUSE THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE
STATE OF NEW YORK TO BE APPLIED.

Credit Agreement for all purposes, including filing and perfection of all
security interests for the benefit of the Secured Creditors.

                           AMOUNT AND TERMS OF CREDIT

Section 2.1.      THE COMMITMENTS.

                  (a) TERM A LOANS. Loans designated on the Initial Borrowing
Date "Term A Loans" were made by each Lender with a Term A Commitment under and
as defined in the Original Credit Agreement in the amount of such Term A
Commitment with the principal amount of each such Term A Loan outstanding
hereunder as a Term A Loan on the Amendment/Restatement Effective Date (as set
forth on SCHEDULE 1.1(a) hereto) to continue to remain outstanding hereunder as
Term A Loans (collectively, the "TERM A LOANS"). No amount of a Term A Loan
which is repaid or prepaid by the Borrower may be reborrowed hereunder.

                  (b) NEW TERM B LOANS. (i) On the Amendment/Restatement
Effective Date, each New Term B Lender, severally and for itself alone, hereby
agrees, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth and in
reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth herein and in the
other Loan Documents, to make a loan (each such loan, a "NEW TERM B LOAN" and
collectively, the "NEW TERM B LOANS") to the Borrower on the



                                       44
<PAGE>

Amendment/Restatement Effective Date in an aggregate principal amount equal to
the New Term B Commitment of such New Term B Lender. The New Term B Loans (1)
shall be incurred by the Borrower pursuant to a single drawing, which shall be
on the Amendment/Restatement Effective Date, (2) shall be denominated in
Dollars, (3) shall be made as Base Rate Loans and, except as hereinafter
provided, may, at the option of the Borrower, be maintained as and/or converted
into Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Loans, PROVIDED, that all New Term B Loans
made by the New Term B Lenders pursuant to the same Borrowing shall, unless
otherwise specifically provided herein, consist entirely of New Term B Loans of
the same Type and (4) shall not exceed for any Lender at the time of incurrence
thereof on the Amendment/Restatement Effective Date the New Term B Commitment,
if any, of such Lender at such time. Each New Term B Lender's New Term B
Commitment shall expire immediately and without further action on the
Amendment/Restatement Effective Date if the New Term B Loans are not made on the
Amendment/Restatement Effective Date. No amount of a New Term B Loan which is
repaid or prepaid by the Borrower may be reborrowed hereunder.

                        (ii) With respect to the New Term B Facility, the New
Term B Lenders hereby agree and acknowledge that the New Term B Loan Maturity
Date may be extended to June 28, 2009, at the option of the Borrower, upon the
conversion, repayment or other disposition in full, all on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Majority Lenders of the New
Term B Facility, of the Subordinated Notes. The Borrower shall provide not less
than 30 days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and the New Term
B Lenders of such extension and shall provide such documentation to the
Administrative Agent and the New Term B Lenders as such parties may request
regarding the conversion, repayment or other disposition in full of the
Subordinated Notes. Any extension notice, is subject to the conditions precedent
that: (i) the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in
ARTICLE VI shall be true and correct, and such extension shall be deemed to
constitute a representation and warranty that on such date such representations
and warranties were true and correct; and (ii) no Event of Default or Unmatured
Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing. Upon the satisfaction of
all conditions described in this SECTION 2.1(b)(ii) (which satisfaction shall be
evidenced in writing to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent and the
Majority Lenders of the New Term B Facility), the New Term B Loan Maturity Date
shall be extended as described herein without any further action of the New Term
B Lenders and the Administrative Agent. The Borrower shall deliver or cause to
be delivered any documentation, including amended New Term B Notes, as may
reasonably be requested by a New Term B Lender in connection with such
extension. In the event that the conditions described herein are not satisfied
by the Borrower prior to March 28, 2007, the New Term B Loan Maturity Date shall
not be extended and the New Term B Loans (to the extent not previously paid)
shall be due and payable on the then New Term B Loan Maturity Date (which for
the avoidance of doubt is acknowledged to be March 28, 2007).

                  (c) REVOLVING LOANS. Each Revolving Lender, severally and for
itself alone, hereby agrees, on the terms and subject to the conditions
hereinafter set forth and in reliance upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, to


                                       45
<PAGE>

make loans to the Borrower denominated in Dollars and in Euro (subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement), on a revolving basis from time to time
during the Commitment Period, so long as after giving effect thereto (and the
use of the proceeds thereof) (A) the Assigned Dollar Value of such Revolving
Lender's Outstanding Revolving Loans would not exceed its Revolver Pro Rata
Share of the Total Available Revolving Commitment or (B) the Assigned Dollar
Value of its Revolver Pro Rata Share of the Multicurrency Outstandings would not
exceed its Multicurrency Commitment (each such loan by any Lender, including
each such loan that is outstanding on the Amendment/Restatement Effective Date
which shall continue to remain outstanding hereunder as a Revolving Loan subject
to the same Interest Period as was applicable to it immediately prior to the
Amendment/Restatement Effective Date, a "REVOLVING LOAN" and collectively, the
"REVOLVING LOANS"). All Revolving Loans comprising the same Borrowing hereunder
shall be made by the Revolving Lenders simultaneously and in proportion to their
respective Revolving Commitments. Prior to the Revolver Termination Date,
Revolving Loans may be repaid and reborrowed by the Borrower in accordance with
the provisions hereof and, except as otherwise specifically provided in SECTION
3.6, all Revolving Loans comprising the same Borrowing shall at all times be of
the same Type.

                  (d) SWING LINE LOANS.

                      (i) SWING LINE COMMITMENT. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender in its individual capacity agrees to
make swing line loans in Dollars ("SWING LINE LOANS") to the Borrower on any
Business Day from time to time during the Commitment Period in an aggregate
principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed $15,000,000;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event may the amount of any Borrowing of Swing
Line Loans (A) exceed the Total Available Revolving Commitment immediately prior
to such Borrowing (after giving effect to the use of proceeds thereof) or (B)
cause the Assigned Dollar Value of the Outstanding Revolving Loans of any
Lender, when added to such Lender's Revolver Pro Rata Share of then outstanding
Swing Line Loans and Revolver Pro Rata Share of the aggregate Assigned Dollar
Value of the LC Obligations (exclusive of Unpaid Drawings relating to LC
Obligations which are repaid with the proceeds of, and simultaneously with the
incurrence of, Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans) to exceed such Lender's
Revolving Commitment. Amounts borrowed by the Borrower under this SECTION
2.1(d)(i) may be repaid and, to but excluding the fifth (5) Business Day prior
to the Revolver Termination Date, reborrowed. Swing Line Loans shall be
maintained as Base Rate Loans and, notwithstanding SECTION 2.6, shall not be
entitled to be converted into any other Type of Loan. Any Swing Line Loans that
are outstanding on the Amendment/Restatement Effective Date shall continue to
remain outstanding hereunder and are deemed to be "Swing Line Loans."

                      (ii) REFUNDING OF SWING LINE LOANS. The Swing Line Lender,
at any time in its sole and absolute discretion, may on behalf of the Borrower
(which hereby irrevocably directs the Swing Line Lender to so act on its behalf)
notify each Revolving Lender (including the Swing Line Lender) to make a
Revolving Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Revolver


                                       46
<PAGE>

Pro Rata Share of the principal amount of the Swing Line Loans (the "REFUNDED
SWING LINE LOANS") outstanding on the date such notice is given, PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that such notice shall be deemed to have automatically been given upon
the occurrence of an Event of Default under SECTIONS 10.1(e) or 10.1(f) or upon
the occurrence of a Change of Control. Unless any of the events described in
SECTIONS 10.1(e) or 10.1(f) shall have occurred (in which event the procedures
of SECTION 2.1(d)(iii) shall apply) and regardless of whether the conditions
precedent set forth in this Agreement to the making of a Revolving Loan are then
satisfied, each Lender shall make the proceeds of its Revolving Loan available
to the Swing Line Lender at the Payment Office prior to 11:00 a.m., New York
City time, in funds immediately available on the Business Day next succeeding
the date such notice is given. The proceeds of such Revolving Loans shall be
immediately applied to repay the Refunded Swing Line Loans.

                      (iii) PARTICIPATION IN SWING LINE LOANS. If, prior to
refunding a Swing Line Loan with a Revolving Loan pursuant to SECTION
2.1(d)(ii), one of the events described in SECTIONS 10.1(e) or 10.1(f) shall
have occurred, or if for any other reason a Revolving Loan cannot be made
pursuant to SECTION 2.1(d)(ii), then, subject to the provisions of SECTION
2.1(d)(iv) below, each Lender will, on the date such Revolving Loan was to have
been made, purchase (without recourse or warranty) from the Swing Line Lender an
undivided participation interest in the Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to
its Revolver Pro Rata Share of such Swing Line Loan. Upon request, each Lender
will immediately transfer to the Swing Line Lender, in immediately available
funds, the amount of its participation and upon receipt thereof the Swing Line
Lender will deliver to such Lender a Swing Line Loan Participation Certificate,
substantially in the form of EXHIBIT 2.1(D) hereto, dated the date of receipt of
such funds and in such amount.

                      (iv) LENDERS' OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL. Each Lender's
obligation to make Revolving Loans in accordance with SECTION 2.1(d)(ii) and to
purchase participating interests in accordance with SECTION 2.1(d)(iii) above
shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance, including, without limitation, (A) any set-off, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing
Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the
occurrence or continuance of any Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default;
(C) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower
or any other Person; (D) any breach of this Agreement by the Borrower or any
other Person; (E) any inability of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions
precedent to borrowing set forth in this Agreement on the date upon which such
participating interest is to be purchased or (F) any other circumstance,
happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
If any Lender does not make available to the Swing Line Lender the amount
required pursuant to SECTION 2.1(d)(ii) or (iii) above, as the case may be, the
Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such
Lender, together with interest thereon for each day from the date of non-payment
until such amount is paid in full at the Federal Funds Rate for the first two
(2) Business Days and at the Base Rate thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this SECTION


                                       47
<PAGE>

2.1(d)(iv), no Lender shall be required to make a Revolving Loan to the Borrower
for the purpose of refunding a Swing Line Loan pursuant to SECTION 2.1(d)(ii)
above or to purchase a participating interest in a Swing Line Loan pursuant to
SECTION 2.1(d)(iii) if an Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and, prior to the making by the Swing Line Lender of
such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender has received written notice from
such Lender specifying that such Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, describing the nature thereof and stating that,
as a result thereof, such Lender shall cease to make such Refunded Swing Line
Loans and purchase such participating interests, as the case may be; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the obligation of such Lender to make such Refunded Swing Line
Loans and to purchase such participating interests shall be reinstated upon the
earlier to occur of (y) the date upon which such Lender notifies the Swing Line
Lender that its prior notice has been withdrawn and (z) the date upon which the
Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default specified in such notice no
longer is continuing.

Section 2.2.      NOTES.

                  (a) EVIDENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS. On the Initial Borrowing Date,
the Borrower issued (i) to each Lender that made a Term A Loan on such date a
Term A Note, (ii) to each Lender with a Revolving Commitment on such date a
Revolving Note, and (iii) to the Swingline Lender a Swingline Note. The Borrower
has from time to time thereafter, in connection with assignments made pursuant
to SECTION 12.8(c) hereof, issued new Notes as required by such Section to the
respective assignees. As of the Amendment/Restatement Effective Date, the
Borrower's obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Term Loans
made to it by each New Term B Lender shall, if requested by a Lender, be
evidenced by a promissory note (each, a "NEW TERM B NOTE" and, collectively, the
"NEW TERM B NOTES") duly executed and delivered by the Borrower substantially in
the form of EXHIBIT 2.2(A) hereto, with blanks appropriately completed in
conformity herewith.

                  (b) NOTATION OF PAYMENTS. Each Lender will note on its
internal records the amount of each Loan made by it, and each payment in respect
thereof and will, prior to any transfer of any of its Notes, endorse on the
reverse side thereof the outstanding principal amount (and, with respect to
Revolving Notes, the applicable currency) of Loans evidenced thereby. Failure to
make any such notation, or any error in any such notation, shall not affect the
Borrower's or any guarantor's obligations hereunder or under the other
applicable Loan Documents in respect of such Loans.

Section 2.3.      MINIMUM AMOUNT OF EACH BORROWING; MAXIMUM NUMBER OF
                  BORROWINGS.

The aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing (other than with respect to
Swing Line Loans) by the Borrower hereunder shall be not less than the Minimum
Borrowing Amount and, if greater, shall be in integral multiples of (i) in the
case of a Borrowing in Dollars, $1,000,000, or (ii) in the case of a Borrowing
in Euro, 1,000,000 Euro, above such minimum (or, if less, the then


                                       48
<PAGE>

Total Available Revolving Commitment). The aggregate principal amount of each
Swing Line Borrowing shall be not less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount and, if
greater, shall be in integral multiples of $100,000. More than one Borrowing may
be incurred on any date; PROVIDED that at no time shall there be outstanding
more than eight Borrowings of Eurocurrency Loans for any Facility.

The Term Loans and the Revolving Loans shall, at the option of the Borrower
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, be (i) Base Rate Loans, (ii)
Eurocurrency Loans, or (iii) part Base Rate Loans and part Eurocurrency Loans;
PROVIDED, that Multicurrency Loans may only be made as Eurocurrency Loans. As to
any Eurocurrency Loan, any Lender may, if it so elects, fulfill its commitment
by causing a foreign branch or affiliate to make or continue such Loan, provided
that in such event that Lender's Loan shall, for the purposes of this Agreement,
be considered to have been made by that Lender and the obligation of the
Borrower to repay that Lender's Loan shall nevertheless be to that Lender and
shall be deemed held by that Lender, for the account of such branch or
affiliate.

Section 2.5.      NOTICE OF BORROWING.

Whenever the Borrower desires to make a Borrowing of any Loan hereunder, it
shall give the Administrative Agent at its office located at 31 West 52nd
Street, New York, New York 10019 (or such other address as the Administrative
Agent may hereafter designate in writing to the parties hereto) (the "NOTICE
ADDRESS") at least one Business Day's prior written notice (or telephonic notice
promptly confirmed in writing), given not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City
time) of each Base Rate Loan, and at least three (3) Business Days' prior
written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing), given not
later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time), of each Dollar denominated
Eurocurrency Loan to be made hereunder and at least four (4) Business Days prior
written notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing) given not
later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time), of each Loan denominated in Euro;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that a Notice of Borrowing with respect to Borrowings to be

Administrative Agent, be delivered later than the time specified above. Whenever
the Borrower desires that Swing Line Lender make a Swing Line Loan under SECTION
2.1(d), it shall deliver to Swing Line Lender prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York City
time) on the date of Borrowing written notice (or telephonic notice promptly
confirmed in writing). Each such notice (each a "NOTICE OF BORROWING"), which
shall be in the form of EXHIBIT 2.5-1 hereto, shall be irrevocable, shall be
deemed a representation by the Borrower that all conditions precedent to such
Borrowing have been satisfied and shall specify (i) the aggregate principal
amount of the Loans to be made pursuant to such Borrowing, (ii) the date of
Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) whether the Loans being made
pursuant to such Borrowing are to be Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Loans and,
with respect to Eurocurrency Loans, (x) the Interest Period to be applicable
thereto and (y) the currency in


                                       49
<PAGE>

which such Loan is to be made. The Administrative Agent shall as promptly as
practicable give each Lender written or telephonic notice (promptly confirmed in
writing) of each proposed Borrowing, of such Lender's Revolver Pro Rata Share
thereof and of the other matters covered by the Notice of Borrowing. Without in
any way limiting the Borrower's obligation to confirm in writing any telephonic
notice, the Administrative Agent or the Swing Line Lender (in the case of Swing
Line Loans) or the respective Facing Agent (in the case of Letters of Credit)
may act without liability upon the basis of telephonic notice believed by the
Administrative Agent in good faith to be from a Responsible Officer of the
Borrower prior to receipt of written confirmation as evidenced in the Notice of
Appointment (or Revocation) of Responsible Officer, which shall be in the form
of EXHIBIT 2.5-2 hereto. The Administrative Agent's records shall, absent
manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower with respect to
evidence of the terms of such telephonic Notice of Borrowing.

Section 2.6.      CONVERSION OR CONTINUATION.

With respect to Dollar denominated Loans, the Borrower may elect (i) on any
Business Day at any time after the seventh Business Day following the
Amendment/Restatement Effective Date to convert Base Rate Loans or any portion
thereof to Eurocurrency Loans and (ii) at the end of any Interest Period with
respect thereto, to convert Eurocurrency Loans or any portion thereof into Base
Rate Loans or to continue such Eurocurrency Loans or any portion thereof for an
additional Interest Period; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the aggregate principal
amount of the Eurocurrency Loans for each Interest Period therefor must be in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the Minimum Borrowing Amount for
Eurocurrency Loans or an integral multiple of (i) in the case of a Borrowing in
Dollars, $1,000,000, or (ii) in the case of a Borrowing in Euro, 1,000,000 Euro,
in each case in excess thereof. With respect to Euro denominated Loans, the
Borrower may elect to continue such Eurocurrency Loans or any portion thereof
for an additional Interest Period. Each conversion or continuation of Term A
Loans shall be allocated among the Term A Loans of the Term A Lenders in
accordance with their respective Term A Pro Rata Shares. Each conversion or
continuation of New Term B Loans shall be allocated among the New Term B Loans
of the New Term B Lenders in accordance with their respective New Term B Pro
Rata Shares. Each conversion or continuation of Revolving Loans shall be
allocated among the Revolving Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their
respective Revolver Pro Rata Shares. Each such election shall be in
substantially the form of EXHIBIT 2.6 hereto (a "NOTICE OF CONVERSION OR
CONTINUATION") and shall be made by giving the Administrative Agent at least
three (3) Business Days' (or one Business Day in the case of a conversion into
Base Rate Loans or four (4) Business Days' in the case of continuation of a
Multicurrency Revolving Loan) prior written notice thereof to the Notice Address
given not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) specifying (i) the amount
and type of conversion or continuation, (ii) in the case of a conversion to or a
continuation of Eurocurrency Loans, the Interest Period therefor, and (iii) in
the case of a conversion, the date of conversion (which date shall be a Business
Day and, if a conversion from Eurocurrency Loans, shall also be the last day of
the Interest Period therefor). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no conversion in
whole or in part of Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Loans, and


                                       50
<PAGE>

no continuation in whole or in part of Dollar denominated Eurocurrency Loans
upon the expiration of any Interest Period therefor, shall be permitted at any
time at which an Unmatured Event of Default or an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing. The Borrower shall not be entitled to specify an
Interest Period in excess of 30 days for any Multicurrency Revolving Loan if an
Unmatured Event of Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing. If, within the time period required under the terms of this SECTION
2.6, the Administrative Agent does not receive a Notice of Conversion or
Continuation from the Borrower containing a permitted election to continue any
Eurocurrency Loans for an additional Interest Period or to convert any such
Loans, then, upon the expiration of the Interest Period therefor, such Loans
will be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans or, in the case of
Multicurrency Revolving Loans, Eurocurrency Loans with an Interest Period of one
month. Each Notice of Conversion or Continuation shall be irrevocable.

Section 2.7.      DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS.

No later than 1:00 p.m. (local time at the place of funding) on the date
specified in each Notice of Borrowing, each Lender will make available its New
Term B Pro Rata Share of New Term B Loans and Revolver Pro Rata Share of
Revolving Loans, as the case may be, of the Borrowing requested to be made on
such date in Dollars or Euro, as the case may be, and in immediately available
funds, at the Payment Office (for the account of such non-U.S. office of the
Administrative Agent as the Administrative Agent may direct in the case of
Eurocurrency Loans) and the Administrative Agent will make available to the
Borrower at its Payment Office the aggregate of the amounts so made available by
the Lenders not later than 2:00 p.m. (local time in the place of payment).
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender at least
one Business Day prior to the date of Borrowing that such Lender does not intend
to make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of the
Borrowing to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such
Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date
of Borrowing and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding
amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the
Administrative Agent by such Lender on the date of Borrowing, the Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such
Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the
Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify the Borrower and, if so notified, the Borrower shall immediately pay such
corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall
also be entitled to recover from the Borrower interest on such corresponding
amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made
available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such
corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per
annum equal to the rate for Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Loans, as the case
may be, applicable during the period in question, PROVIDED, however, that any
interest paid to the Administrative Agent in respect of such corresponding
amount shall be credited against interest payable by the Borrower to such Lender
under


                                       51
<PAGE>

SECTION 3.1 in respect of such corresponding amount. Any amount due hereunder to
the Administrative Agent from any Lender which is not paid when due shall bear
interest payable by such Lender, from the date due until the date paid, at the
Federal Funds Rate for amounts in Dollars (and at the Administrative Agent's
cost of funds for amounts in Euro) for the first three days after the date such
amount is due and thereafter at the Federal Funds Rate (or such cost of funds
rate) plus 1%, together with the Administrative Agent's standard interbank
processing fee. Further, such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and
all payments made of principal and interest on its Loans, amounts due with
respect to its Letters of Credit (or its participations therein) and any other
amounts due to it hereunder first to the Administrative Agent to fund any
outstanding Loans made available on behalf of such Lender by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to this SECTION 2.7 until such Loans have been funded (as a
result of such assignment or otherwise) and then to fund Loans of all Lenders
other than such Lender until each Lender has outstanding Loans equal to its New
Term B Pro Rata Share of all New Term B Loans and its Revolver Pro Rata Share of
all Revolving Loans (as a result of such assignment or otherwise). Such Lender
shall not have recourse against the Borrower with respect to any amounts paid to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to the preceding sentence;
PROVIDED, that such Lender shall have full recourse against the Borrower to the
extent of the amount of such loans it has so been deemed to have made. Nothing
herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its
Commitment hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the Borrower may have
against the Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

Section 2.8.      ADDITIONAL LOAN COMMITMENTS.

                  (a) So long as no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower may, upon 30 days' prior
written notice to the Administrative Agent, request on one or more occasions
that (i) the Revolving Commitment, the commitment available for Term A Loans or
both be increased (PROVIDED such increase shall be in a minimum aggregate amount
for all Lenders (including Eligible Assignees who will become Lenders) of at
least $5,000,000), or (ii) that the Lenders participate in a new credit facility
hereunder (the "      TERM C FACILITY"); PROVIDED that no Lender shall be
under any obligation to increase such Commitment or participate in such
Incremental Term C Facility. The aggregate amount of (y) any increase in the
Revolving Commitment, the commitment available for Term A Loans or both (the
"COMMITMENT INCREASE AMOUNT"), and (z) the amount of the Incremental Term C
Facility, shall not exceed $100,000,000. Such notice shall (A) specify the
requested Commitment Increase Amount or the requested amount of the Incremental
Term C Facility, as the case may be; (B) specify the applicable Facility or
Facilities to which such Commitment Increase Amount is to apply, and if more
than one Facility, the Commitment Increase Amount in respect of each such
Facility; (C) specify the effective date of such Commitment increase or
Incremental Term C Facility, which date shall not be less than 60 nor more than
90 days following the date of such written notice; and (D) include financial
projections satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (a copy of which shall be
provided to the Lenders) which evidence that, after giving effect to the
Commitment Increase Amount or the Incremental Term C


                                       52
<PAGE>

Facility, as the case may be, including, without limitation, the amortization
terms thereof, on a pro forma basis through the Term A Loan Maturity Date, the
Borrower shall be in compliance with the covenants set forth in ARTICLE IX of
this Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Incremental Term C Facility
shall be as follows: (1) the amount of the Incremental Term C Facility shall be
the amount in respect of which the Lenders and any other financial institutions
which becomes a Incremental Term C Lender pursuant to SECTION 2.8(d) have agreed
to participate in accordance with this SECTION 2.8(a); (2) the Borrower shall
use the proceeds of any loans under the Incremental Term C Facility solely for
the purpose or purposes agreed to by the Lenders who agree to participate in the
Incremental Term C Facility and the other financial institutions which become
Incremental Term C Lenders pursuant to SECTION 2.8(d); (3) the Incremental Term
C Facility shall be made in Dollars, shall not revolve and any amount repaid or
prepaid under the Incremental Term C Facility cannot be reborrowed and shall
reduce the Incremental Term C Commitment by the amount repaid or prepaid, as the
case may be; (4) the Loans outstanding under the Incremental Term C Facility
shall have a weighted average life to maturity not less than the weighted
average life to maturity of the Term A Facility and shall mature no earlier than
the Term A Loan Maturity Date in respect of the Term A Facility; and (5) such
other terms and conditions agreed to by the Borrower and the Lenders who have
agreed to participate in accordance with this SECTION 2.8 and the other
financial institutions who have become Lenders pursuant to SECTION 2.8(d), which
terms and conditions (other than provisions relating to interest and fees) shall
not, taken as a whole, in any event, be more onerous or more extensive than the
terms and conditions set out in this Agreement. Upon receipt of such request the
Administrative Agent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify the
applicable Lenders of such request.

                  (b) Each applicable Lender shall advise the Administrative
Agent in writing as to whether it consents to such requested increase or
participation, as the case may be, within 30 days of receipt by the
Administrative Agent from the Borrower of the notice requesting such increase or
participation, as the case may be. If any Lender does not provide such notice
within such time, such Lender shall be deemed to have refused the applicable
request. Not more than two (2) Business Days following (i) the last day for
receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notices or (ii) if all such relevant
Lenders shall have provided such notice, the day on which the last of such
notices shall have been received by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative
Agent shall advise the Borrower and each such Lender, with respect to each such
Lender, whether such Lender has consented to the requested Commitment Increase
Amount or request to participate in the Incremental Term C Facility, as the case
may be, or has refused, or is deemed to have refused, such requested Commitment
Increase Amount or request to participate in the Incremental Term C Facility, as
the case may be, and of the aggregate amount by which those Lenders consenting
to such Commitment Increase Amount have agreed to increase their respective
Commitments or participate in the Incremental Term C Facility.

                  (c) Subject to SECTION 2.8(e), in the event that the Borrower
has requested an increase of the Revolving Commitment or commitment available
for Term A Loans pursuant to


                                       53
<PAGE>

SECTION 2.8(a) and (i) such Commitment Increase Amount has been agreed to by all
of the then existing Lenders, then the applicable Commitment in respect of each
such Lender shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount consented to by
such consenting Lender; or (ii) such increase has been consented to by some, but
not all, of the applicable Lenders, then (y) with respect to the consenting
Lenders, the relevant Commitment of each such Lender shall be increased by an
amount equal to the amount consented to by such consenting Lender; and (z) with
respect to the non-consenting Lenders, the relevant Commitment shall not be
increased.

                  (d) If consenting Lenders have not offered to advance all of
the Commitment Increase Amount or to participate in the Incremental Term C
Facility, as the case may be, then the Borrower (in coordination with the
Administrative Agent) may arrange for one or more other financial institutions
which qualify as Eligible Assignees hereunder and which are consented to by the
Administrative Agent and, with respect to an increase in the Revolving
Commitment, the Facing Agent (it being understood and agreed that such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to offer to advance the balance
of such Commitment Increase Amount or the balance of the requested amount of the
Incremental Term C Facility, as the case may be (subject to the Lenders and such
other financial institution or institutions, as the case may be, executing and
delivering any documentation required by the Administrative Agent to evidence
the agreement of such other financial institution or institutions to advance all
or a part of the balance of such Commitment Increase Amount or the balance of
the requested amount of the Incremental Term C Facility, as the case may be);
PROVIDED, that any additional Commitment provided by any such Eligible Assignee
which is not already a Lender shall be in a minimum amount (for such Eligible
Assignee) of at least $2,500,000. In the case of a Commitment Increase Amount,
the Borrower shall, in coordination with the Administrative Agent, (x) repay all
outstanding Revolving Loans of the Revolving Lenders in each case so that the
Revolving Lenders participate in each Borrowing of Revolving Loans pro rata on
the basis of their respective Revolving Loan Commitments (after giving effect to
any increase in the Total Revolving Loan Commitment pursuant to this SECTION
2.8) and with the Borrower being obligated to pay the respective Revolving
Lenders the costs of the type referred to in SECTION 3.5 in connection with any
such repayment and/or Borrowing and (y) on such date with respect to an increase
in the Revolving Commitment, all outstanding Letters of Credit and LC
Obligations, shall be automatically adjusted to the participations by the
Lenders in such Letters of Credit and LC Obligations to reflect the new
Revolving Percentages of the Revolving Lenders.

                  (e) Any increase in the Revolving Commitment or the commitment
available for Term A Loans hereunder, or the participation of any Lender in the
Incremental Term C Facility, is subject to the conditions precedent that the
Borrower, the Lenders and such other financial institution or institutions shall
have executed and delivered any documentation reasonably required by the
Administrative Agent to evidence such increase of the Revolving Facility or the
commitment available for Term A Loans hereunder or to establish the Incremental
Term C Facility and that: (i) the representations and warranties of the Borrower
contained in ARTICLE VI shall be true and correct, and such increase or
participation, as the case may be, shall


                                       54
<PAGE>

be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty that on such date such
representations and warranties were true and correct; and (ii) no Event of
Default or Unmatured Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing. On
the date that any of the events described in this SECTION 2.8 become effective,
SCHEDULE 1.1(a) shall be deemed modified to reflect the revised Revolving
Commitment or revised commitment available for Term A Loans or the additional
Incremental Term C Facility, as the case may be.

Section 2.9.      PRO RATA BORROWINGS.

All Borrowings of New Term B Loans and Revolving Loans under this Agreement
shall be loaned by the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their New Term B
Commitments and Revolving Commitments, as the case may be. No Lender shall be
responsible for any default by any other Lender in its obligation to make Loans
hereunder and each Lender shall be obligated to make the Loans provided to be
made by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other Lender to fulfill
its Commitments hereunder.

Section 2.10.     AMOUNT AND TERMS OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  (a) LETTERS OF CREDIT; TERMS OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                      (i) Each Letter of Credit issued pursuant to SECTION
2.10(a) of the Original Credit Agreement and outstanding on the
Amendment/Restatement Effective Date, as listed on SCHEDULE 2.10(a) hereto,
shall continue to remain outstanding as a Letter of Credit hereunder on and
after such Amendment/Restatement Effective Date on the same terms as applicable
to it immediately prior to such Amendment/Restatement Effective Date. Subject to
and upon the terms and conditions herein set forth, at any time and from time to
time on or after the Amendment/Restatement Effective Date and to but not
including a date which is thirty (30) days prior to the Revolver Termination
Date, each Facing Agent agrees, severally not jointly, to issue each in its own
name, but for the ratable account of all Revolving Lenders (including the
applicable Facing Agent), one or more Letters of Credit, each having a Stated
Amount denominated in Dollars or Euro, for the account of the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that a Facing Agent shall not issue or
extend the expiration of any Letter of Credit if, immediately after giving
effect to such issuance or extension, (A) the aggregate LC Obligations at such
time would exceed the Dollar Equivalent of Sixty Million Dollars ($60,000,000),
or (B) the sum of the Assigned Dollar Value of Revolving Loans, the Assigned
Dollar Value of Swing Line Loans and the Assigned Dollar Value of LC Obligations
would exceed the Total Revolving Commitment or (C) the Multicurrency
Outstandings would exceed the Multicurrency Commitment. Each Revolving Lender,
severally, but not jointly, agrees to participate in each such Letter of Credit
issued by the applicable Facing Agent in an amount equal to its Revolver Pro
Rata Share, and to make available to the applicable Facing Agent such Lender's
Revolver Pro Rata Share of any payment made to the beneficiary of such Letter of
Credit to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
Revolving


                                       55
<PAGE>

Lender shall be required to participate in any Letter of Credit to the extent
that such participation therein would exceed such Revolving Lender's Available
Revolving Commitment then in effect. No Revolving Lender's obligation to
participate in any Letter of Credit or to make available to the applicable
Facing Agent such Revolving Lender's Revolver Pro Rata Share of any Letter of
Credit Payment made by the applicable Facing Agent shall be affected by any
other Revolving Lender's failure to participate in the same or any other
Revolving Letter of Credit or by any other Lender's failure to make available to
the applicable Facing Agent such other Revolving Lender's Revolver Pro Rata
Share of any Letter of Credit Payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event a Lender Default exists, the Facing Agent shall not be required to issue
any Letter of Credit unless the Facing Agent has entered into arrangements
satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate such Facing Agent's risk with
respect to the participation in Letters of Credit of the Defaulting Lender or
Lenders, including by cash collateralizing such Defaulting Lender's Revolver Pro
Rata Share of the LC Obligations.

                      (ii) Each Letter of Credit issued or to be issued
hereunder shall be issued on a sight basis, and shall have an expiration date of
one (1) year or less from the issuance date thereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
each Standby Letter of Credit may provide by its terms that it will be
automatically extended for additional successive periods of up to one (1) year
as to each successive period unless the applicable Facing Agent shall have given
notice to the applicable beneficiary (with a copy to the Borrower) of the
election by the applicable Facing Agent (such election to be in the sole and
absolute discretion of the applicable Facing Agent) not to extend such Letter of
Credit, such notice to be given prior to the then current expiration date of
such Letter of Credit; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that no Standby Letter of Credit or
extension thereof shall be stated to expire later than the day five (5) Business
Days prior to the Revolver Termination Date and no Commercial Letter of Credit
or extension thereof shall be stated to expire later than the day thirty (30)
days prior to the Revolver Termination Date.

                  (b) PROCEDURE FOR ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT. Whenever the
Borrower desires the issuance of a Letter of Credit hereunder, it shall give the
Administrative Agent and the applicable Facing Agent at least four (4) Business
Days' prior written notice (or such shorter period as may be agreed to by the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the applicable Facing Agent) specifying
the day of issuance thereof (which day shall be a Business Day), such notice to
be given prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date specified for the
giving of such notice. Each such notice (each, a "LETTER OF CREDIT REQUEST")
shall be in the form of EXHIBIT 2.10(B) hereto and shall specify (A) the
proposed issuance date and expiration date, (B) the name(s) of each obligor with
respect to such Letter of Credit, (C) the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries as
the account party, (D) the name and address of the beneficiary, (E) the Stated
Amount of such proposed Letter of Credit, (F) the currency in which such
proposed Letter of Credit is to be issued and (G) such other information as
Facing Agent may reasonably request. In addition, each Letter of Credit Request
shall contain a description of the terms and conditions to be included in such
proposed Letter of Credit (all of which terms and conditions shall be acceptable
in form to the applicable Facing Agent). Promptly after the issuance, amendment,



                                       56
<PAGE>

extension or modification of a Standby Letter of Credit, the Facing Agent shall
notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in writing of such activity
and such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of such issuance, amendment,
extension or modification. Upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent
shall notify the Revolving Lenders of such issuance, amendment, extension or
modification and, if any Revolving Lender so requests, the Administrative Agent
shall provide such Revolving Lender with copies of such issuance, amendment,
modification or extension. With regard to Commercial Letters of Credit, the
Facing Agent shall, on the first Business Day of each week, provide the
Administrative Agent, by facsimile, with a report of the daily aggregate
outstandings for the previous week. Unless otherwise specified, all Letters of
Credit will be governed by the "Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary
Credits" as in effect on the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit. On the
Business Day specified by the Borrower and upon confirmation from the
Administrative Agent that the applicable conditions set forth in ARTICLE V have
been fulfilled or waived, the applicable Facing Agent will issue the requested
Letter of Credit to the applicable beneficiary.

                  (c) DRAWS UPON LETTERS OF CREDIT; REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION. In
the event of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof,
the applicable Facing Agent shall give telephonic notice to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (x) confirming such drawing and (y) of the date on or
before which such Facing Agent intends to honor such drawing, and the Borrower
shall reimburse the applicable Facing Agent on the day on which such drawing is
honored in an amount in same day funds equal to the amount of such drawing;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, (i) unless the Borrower shall have notified the Administrative
Agent and the applicable Facing Agent prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York City time)
on the Business Day the applicable Facing Agent intends to honor such drawing
that the Borrower intends to reimburse the applicable Facing Agent for the
amount of such drawing with funds other than the proceeds of Revolving Loans,
the Borrower shall be deemed to have timely given a Notice of Borrowing to the
Administrative Agent requesting each Revolving Lender to make (A) as to Domestic
Letters of Credit, Revolving Loans which are Base Rate Loans, and (B) as to
Multicurrency Letters of Credit, Revolving Loans which are Eurocurrency Loans
denominated in Euro with an Interest Period of 30 days, on the date on which
such drawing is honored in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the
amount of such drawing and the Administrative Agent shall, if such Notice of
Borrowing is deemed given, promptly notify the Lenders thereof and (ii) unless
any of the events described in SECTION 10.1(e) or 10.1(f) shall have occurred or
in the event that such unreimbursed drawing is in an amount that is less than
the Minimum Borrowing Amount for a Revolving Loan (in which events the
procedures of SECTION 2.10(d) shall apply), each such Lender shall, on the date
such drawing is honored, make (A) as to Domestic Letters of Credit, Revolving
Loans which are Base Rate Loans, and (B) as to Multicurrency Letters of Credit,
Revolving Loans which are Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Euro with an
Interest Period of 30 days, in each case, in the amount of its Revolver Pro Rata
Share of the Dollar Equivalent of such drawing, the proceeds of which shall be
applied directly by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Facing
Agent for the amount of such drawing; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that, if for any
reason, proceeds of


                                       57
<PAGE>

Revolving Loans are not received by the applicable Facing Agent on such date in
an amount equal to the amount of the Dollar Equivalent of such drawing, the
Borrower shall reimburse the applicable Facing Agent, on the Business Day
immediately following the date such drawing is honored, in an amount in same day
funds equal to the excess of the amount of the Dollar Equivalent of such drawing
over the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such Revolving Loans, if any, which
are so received, plus accrued interest on such amount at the rate set forth in
SECTION 3.1(a).

                  (d) LENDERS' PARTICIPATION IN LETTERS OF CREDIT. In the event
that the Borrower shall fail to reimburse the applicable Facing Agent as
provided in SECTION 2.10(c) in an amount equal to the amount of any drawing
honored by the applicable Facing Agent under a Letter of Credit issued by it in
accordance with the terms hereof, the applicable Facing Agent shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify each Revolving Lender of the unreimbursed amount of such drawing and of
such Lender's respective participation therein. Each such Revolving Lender shall
purchase (x) a participation interest in such Domestic LC Obligation and shall
make available to the applicable Facing Agent in Dollars, an amount equal to its
Revolver Pro Rata Share of such drawing in same day funds, at the office of the
applicable Facing Agent specified in such notice, and (y) a participation
interest in such Multicurrency LC Obligation and shall make available to the
applicable Facing Agent, in Euro, an amount equal to its Revolver Pro Rata Share
of such drawing in same day funds, at the office of the applicable Facing Agent
specified in such notice, in each case not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City
time) on the Business Day after the date such Lender is notified by the
Administrative Agent. In the event that any such Lender fails to make available
to the applicable Facing Agent the amount of such Lender's participation in such
Letter of Credit as provided in this SECTION 2.10(d), the applicable Facing
Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender
together with interest (x) at the Federal Funds Rate for two (2) Business Days
and thereafter at the Base Rate for such payment obligations denominated in
Dollars and (y) at the rate customary in Euro for settlement of similar
interbank obligations, as quoted by the Facing Agent for two (2) Business Days
and thereafter at the rate per annum applicable to Eurocurrency Loans having an
Interest Period of seven days for such payment obligations denominated in Euro.
Nothing in this SECTION 2.10(d) shall be deemed to prejudice the right of any
Lender to recover from the applicable Facing Agent any amounts made available by
such Lender to the applicable Facing Agent pursuant to this SECTION 2.10(d) in
the event that it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the
payment with respect to a Letter of Credit by the applicable Facing Agent in
respect of which payment was made by such Lender constituted gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of the applicable Facing Agent. The applicable
Facing Agent shall distribute to each other Lender which has paid all amounts
payable by it under this SECTION 2.10(d) with respect to any Letter of Credit
issued by the applicable Facing Agent such other Revolving Lender's Revolver Pro
Rata Share of all payments received by the applicable Facing Agent from the
Borrower in reimbursement of drawings honored by the applicable Facing Agent
under such Letter of Credit when such payments are received. Each Lender's
obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to SECTION 2.10(c) or to


                                       58
<PAGE>

purchase participations pursuant to this SECTION 2.10(d) as a result of a
drawing under a Letter of Credit shall be absolute and unconditional and without
recourse to the applicable Facing Agent and shall not be affected by any
circumstance, including (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or
other right which such Lender may have against the Facing Agent, the Borrower or
any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance
of an Event of Default or a Material Adverse Effect; or (iii) any other
circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of
the foregoing.

                  (e) FEES FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                      (i) FACING AGENT FEES. The Borrower agrees to pay the
following amount to the applicable Facing Agent with respect to the Letters of
Credit issued by it for the account of the Borrower:

                          (A) with respect to drawings made under any Letter of
Credit, interest, payable on demand, on the amount paid by Facing Agent in
respect of each such drawing from the date a drawing is honored up to (but not
including) the date such amount is reimbursed by the Borrower (including any
such reimbursement out of the proceeds of Revolving Loans or pursuant to SECTION
2.10(c)) at a rate which is at all times equal to 2% per annum in excess of the
Base Rate;

                          (B) with respect to the issuance or amendment of each
Letter of Credit and each payment made thereunder, documentary and processing
charges in accordance with the applicable Facing Agent's standard schedule for
such charges in effect at the time of such issuance, amendment, transfer or
payment, as the case may be; and

                          (C) a facing fee payable to the applicable Facing
Agent for the applicable Letters of Credit equal to 0.25% per annum of
outstanding LC Obligations payable with respect to the maximum Stated Amount
under such outstanding Letters of Credit payable in arrears on each Quarterly
Payment Date, on the Revolver Termination Date and thereafter, on demand
together with customary issuance and payment charges payable pursuant to clause
(B) above; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if that calculation of the facing fee in the
manner set forth above would result in a facing fee of less than $500 per year
per Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall be obligated to pay such additional
amount to such Facing Agent so as to provide for a minimum facing fee of $500
per year per Letter of Credit. The facing fee shall be computed from the first
day of issuance of each Letter of Credit and on the basis of the actual number
of days elapsed over a year of 360 days.

                      (ii) PARTICIPATING LENDER FEES. The Borrower agrees to pay
to the Administrative Agent for distribution to each participating Revolving
Lender in respect of all Letters of Credit outstanding such Revolving Lender's
Revolver Pro Rata Share of a commission equal to the then Applicable
Eurocurrency Margin for Revolving Loans per annum with respect


                                       59
<PAGE>

to the maximum Stated Amount under such outstanding Letters of Credit (the "LC
COMMISSION"), payable in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date, on the Revolver
Termination Date and thereafter, on demand. The LC Commission shall be computed
from the first day of issuance of each Letter of Credit and on the basis of the
actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days.

                  Promptly upon receipt by a Facing Agent or the Administrative
Agent of any amount described in clause (i)(A) or (ii) of this SECTION 2.10(e),
the applicable Facing Agent or the Administrative Agent shall distribute to each
Revolving Lender its Revolver Pro Rata Share of such amount as long as, in the
case of amounts described in clause (i)(A), such Lender has reimbursed the
applicable Facing Agent in accordance with SECTION 2.10(c) or (d). Amounts
payable under clause (i)(B) and (C) of this SECTION 2.10(e) shall be paid
directly to the applicable Facing Agent. Amounts payable under clause (i) or
(ii) of this SECTION 2.10(e) shall be paid in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent
of the amount of such fee calculated in the currency in which such Letter of
Credit is denominated.

                  (f) LC OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL. The obligation of the
Borrower to reimburse a Facing Agent (or any Lender that has purchased a
participation from or made a Loan to enable the Borrower to reimburse the
applicable Facing Agent) for drawings made under any Letter of Credit issued by
it and the obligations of each Lender under SECTION 2.10(d) with respect thereto
shall be unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including, without
limitation, any of the following circumstances:

                      (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter
of Credit;

                      (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other
right which the Borrower or any of its Affiliates may have at any time against a
beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any persons or
entities for which any such beneficiary or transferee may be acting), the
applicable Facing Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection
with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated
transaction (including any underlying transaction between the Borrower or one of
its Subsidiaries and the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit);

                      (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or any other document
presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid
or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect;

                      (iv) payment by the applicable Facing Agent under such
Letter of Credit against presentation of a demand, draft or certificate or other
document which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;


                                       60
<PAGE>

                      (v) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; or

                      (vi) the fact that an Event of Default or an Unmatured
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Borrower nor the Lenders (other than
the applicable Facing Agent in its capacity as such) shall be liable for any
obligation resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
applicable Facing Agent, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction,
with respect to any Letter of Credit.

                  (g) INDEMNIFICATION. In addition to amounts payable as
elsewhere provided in this Agreement, the Borrower hereby agrees to protect,
indemnify, pay and save the applicable Facing Agent and the Lenders harmless
from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses,
costs, charges and expenses (including Attorney Costs) (other than for Taxes,
which shall be covered by SECTION 4.7) which the applicable Facing Agent and the
Lenders may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (i)
the issuance of the Letters of Credit, other than as a result of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the applicable Facing Agent, as determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) the failure of the applicable
Facing Agent to honor a drawing under any Letter of Credit as a result of any
act or omissions, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure
or de facto Governmental Authority (all such acts or omissions herein called
"GOVERNMENT ACTS") other than arising out of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, of the
applicable Facing Agent. As between the Borrower on the one hand, and the
applicable Facing Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, the Borrower assumes
all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit
issued by the applicable Facing Agent by, the respective beneficiaries of such
Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
neither the applicable Facing Agent nor any of the Lenders shall be responsible:
(i) for the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect
of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for
and issuance of or any drawing under such Letters of Credit, even if it should
in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate,
fraudulent or forged; (ii) for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument
transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of
Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in
part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) for
failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit to comply fully with
conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) for
errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any
messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex, or otherwise, whether or not they be
in cipher; (v) for errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) for any
loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order
to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof;
(vii) for the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of
the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; and (viii) for any
consequences arising from


                                       61
<PAGE>

causes beyond the control of the applicable Facing Agent, including, without
limitation, any Government Acts. None of the above shall effect, impair, or
prevent the vesting of any of the applicable Facing Agent's or any Lender's
rights or powers hereunder.

                  In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the
specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted by the
applicable Facing Agent under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued
by it or the related certificates, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not
put the applicable Facing Agent under any resulting liability to the Borrower.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Borrower shall have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless the applicable
Facing Agent in respect of any claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses,
costs, charges or expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the applicable
Facing Agent to the extent arising out of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the applicable Facing Agent, as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction. The right of indemnification in the first paragraph of this
SECTION 2.10(g) shall not prejudice any rights that the Borrower may otherwise
have against the applicable Facing Agent with respect to a Letter of Credit
issued hereunder.

                  (h) STATED AMOUNT. The Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit
shall not be less than the Dollar Equivalent of One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000) or such lesser amount as the applicable Facing Agent has agreed to.

                  (i) INCREASED COSTS. If at any time after Initial Borrowing
Date, any Facing Agent or any Lender determines that the introduction of or any
change in any applicable law, rule, regulation, order, guideline or request or
in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the
applicable Facing Agent or such Lender with any request or directive by any such
authority (whether or not having the force of law), shall either (i) impose,
modify or make applicable any reserve, deposit, capital adequacy or similar
requirement against letters of credit issued by the applicable Facing Agent or
participated in by any Lender, or (ii) impose on the applicable Facing Agent or
any Lender any other conditions relating, directly or indirectly, to the
provisions of this Agreement relating to Letters of Credit or any Letter of
Credit; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the
applicable Facing Agent or any Lender of issuing, maintaining or participating
in any Letter of Credit, or reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable
by the applicable Facing Agent or any Lender hereunder or reduce the rate of
return on its capital with respect to Letters of Credit, then, upon demand to
the Borrower by the applicable Facing Agent or any Lender (a copy of which
demand shall be sent by the applicable Facing Agent or such Lender to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the applicable Facing Agent or
such Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate the applicable Facing Agent or such Lender for such increased cost or
reduction in the amount receivable or reduction on the rate of return on its
capital. In determining such additional amounts pursuant to the preceding
sentence, the applicable Facing Agent or such Lender will act reasonably and in
good faith and will, to the extent the increased


                                       62
<PAGE>

costs or reductions in amounts receivable or reductions in rates of return
relate to Facing Agent's or such Lender's letters of credit in general and are
not specifically attributable to the Letters of Credit hereunder, use averaging
and attribution methods which are reasonable and which cover all letters of
credit similar to the Letters of Credit issued by or participated in by the
applicable Facing Agent or such Lender whether or not the documentation for such
other Letters of Credit permit the applicable Facing Agent or such Lender to
receive amounts of the type described in this SECTION 2.10(i). The applicable
Facing Agent or any Lender, upon determining that any additional amounts will be
payable pursuant to this SECTION 2.10(i), will give prompt written notice
thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall include a certificate submitted to
the Borrower by the applicable Facing Agent or such Lender (a copy of which
certificate shall be sent by the applicable Facing Agent or such Lender to the
Administrative Agent), setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the
calculation of such additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate the
applicable Facing Agent or such Lender, although failure to give any such notice
shall not release or diminish the Borrower's obligations to pay additional
amounts pursuant to this SECTION 2.10(i); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if the applicable
Facing Agent or such Lender, as applicable, has intentionally withheld or
delayed such notice, the applicable Facing Agent or such Lender, as the case may
be, shall not be entitled to receive additional amounts pursuant to this SECTION
2.10(i) for periods occurring prior to the 180th day before the giving of such
notice. The certificate required to be delivered pursuant to this SECTION
2.10(i) shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding on the
Borrower.

                  (j) CASH COLLATERALIZATION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT. To the extent
that (i) the expiration date of any Letter of Credit extends beyond the Revolver
Termination Date and (ii) the Borrower, two Business Days prior to the Revolver
Termination Date, has notified in writing the Facing Agent which issued such
Letter of Credit that the Borrower desires to keep such Letter of Credit
outstanding after the Revolver Termination Date, then, the Borrower shall, by no
later than the Revolver Termination Date, deposit in an account with the
applicable Facing Agent as cash collateral an amount equal to 110% of the LC
Obligations of each such Letter of Credit to remain outstanding in Dollars and
in cash, as of the Revolver Termination Date, plus any accrued and unpaid
interest thereon. Each such deposit pursuant to this SECTION 2.10(j) shall be
held by the applicable Facing Agent as collateral for the payment and
performance of the obligations of the Borrower, with respect to such Letter of
Credit. The applicable Facing Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control,
including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any
interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be
made at the option and discretion of the applicable Facing Agent and at the
Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or
profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in
such account shall be applied by the applicable Facing Agent to reimburse itself
for drawings on such Letter of Credit for which it has not been reimbursed and,
to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the
reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Obligations related
thereto. At such time as a Letter of Credit shall expire by its terms or
otherwise be cancelled and returned to the applicable Facing Agent by the
beneficiary thereof, the Facing Agent shall, to the extent amounts


                                       63
<PAGE>

held in the cash collateral account relating to such Letter of Credit have not
been applied against the Obligations of the Borrower as provided herein,
promptly return to the Borrower any amounts remaining in such account.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Facing Agent, the Administrative Agent, the
Borrower and the Lenders hereby agree and acknowledge that at such time as the
Revolver Termination Date shall have occurred and a Facing Agent has received
cash collateral pursuant to this SECTION 2.10(j), no Revolving Lender shall be
required to participate in any Letter of Credit or drawing thereunder or to
provide Revolving Loans to reimburse the applicable Facing Agent for the amount
of any drawing made under any Letter of Credit outstanding after the Revolver
Termination Date.

                                  ARTICLE III

                                INTEREST AND FEES

Section 3.1.      INTEREST.

                  (a) BASE RATE LOANS. The Borrower agrees to pay interest in
respect of the unpaid principal amount of each Base Rate Loan at a rate per
annum equal to the Base Rate PLUS the Applicable Base Rate Margin from the date
the proceeds thereof are made available to the Borrower (or, if such Base Rate
Loan was converted from a Eurocurrency Loan, the date of such conversion) until
the earlier of (i) the maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) of such
Base Rate Loan or (ii) the conversion of such Base Rate Loan to a Eurocurrency
Loan pursuant to SECTION 2.6.

                  (b) EUROCURRENCY LOANS. The Borrower agrees to pay interest in
respect of the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Loan from the date
the proceeds thereof are made available to the Borrower (or, if such
Eurocurrency Loan was converted from a Base Rate Loan, the date of such
conversion) until the earlier of (i) the maturity (whether by acceleration or
otherwise) of such Eurocurrency Loan or (ii) the conversion of such Eurocurrency
Loan to a Base Rate Loan pursuant to SECTION 2.6, at a rate per annum equal to
the relevant Eurocurrency Rate PLUS the Applicable Eurocurrency Margin.

                  (c) PAYMENT OF INTEREST. Interest on each Loan shall be
payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
interest accruing pursuant to SECTION 3.1(e) and as otherwise set forth in the
second to last sentence of this SECTION 3.1(c) shall be payable from time to
time on demand. Interest shall also be payable on all then outstanding Revolving
Loans on the Revolver Termination Date and on all Loans and Revolving Loans on
the date of repayment (including prepayment) thereof (except that voluntary
prepayments of Swing Line Loans and Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans
made pursuant to SECTION 4.3 on any day other than a Quarterly Payment Date or
the Revolver Termination Date need not be made with accrued interest from the
most recent Quarterly Payment Date, PROVIDED such accrued interest is paid on
the next Quarterly Payment Date) and on the date of maturity (by acceleration or



                                       64
<PAGE>

otherwise) of such Loans. During the existence of any Event of Default, interest
on any Loan shall be payable on demand. Interest to be paid with respect to
Loans denominated in (x) Dollars shall be paid in Dollars and (y) in Euro shall
be in Euro.

                  (d) NOTIFICATION OF RATE. The Administrative Agent, upon
determining the interest rate for any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans for any
Interest Period, shall promptly notify the Borrower (by no later than one
Business Day following the date of such determination) and the Lenders thereof.
Such determination shall, absent manifest error and subject to SECTION 3.6, be
final, conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto.

                  (e) DEFAULT INTEREST. Notwithstanding the rates of interest
specified herein, effective on the date of the occurrence of any Event of
Default and for so long thereafter as any such Event of Default shall be
continuing, and effective immediately upon any failure to pay any Obligations or
any other amounts due under any of the Loan Documents when due, whether by
acceleration or otherwise, the principal balance of each Loan then outstanding
and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any interest payment on each
Loan not paid when due or other amounts then due and payable shall bear interest
payable on demand, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal
to the Default Rate.

                  (f) MAXIMUM INTEREST. If any interest payment or other charge
or fee payable hereunder exceeds the maximum amount then permitted by applicable
law, the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the maximum amount then permitted by
applicable law and the Borrower shall continue to pay the maximum amount from
time to time permitted by applicable law until all such interest payments and
other charges and fees otherwise due hereunder (in the absence of such restraint
imposed by applicable law) have been paid in full.

Section 3.2.      FEES.

                  (a) COMMITMENT FEES. The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for pro rata distribution to each Non-Defaulting Lender
having a Revolving Commitment a commitment fee (the "COMMITMENT FEE"), payable
in Dollars, for the period commencing on the Initial Borrowing Date to and
including the Revolver Termination Date or the earlier termination of the
Revolving Commitments (and repayment in full of the Revolving Loans and payment
in full, or cash collateralization by the deposit of cash into the Collateral
Account in amounts and pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent, of the LC Obligations), computed at a rate equal to the
Applicable Commitment Fee Percentage per annum on the average daily Total
Available Revolving Commitment (with the Available Revolving Commitment of each
Lender determined without reduction for such Lender's Revolver Pro Rata Share of
the Assigned Dollar Value of Swing Line Loans outstanding). Unless otherwise
specified, accrued Commitment Fees shall be due and payable (i) on each
Quarterly Payment Date occurring after the Initial Borrowing Date, (ii) on the
Revolver Termination Date and (iii)




                                       65
<PAGE>


upon any reduction or termination in whole or in part of the Revolving
Commitments (but only, in the case of a reduction, on the portion of the
Revolving Commitments then being reduced).

                  (b) AGENCY FEES. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for its own account and for the account of the Agents, such other fees in
the amount and at the times set forth in any letter agreement between the
Borrower and the Agents.

Section 3.3.      COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES.

Interest on all Loans and fees payable hereunder shall be computed on the basis
of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days; PROVIDED that
interest on all Base Rate Loans shall be computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be. Each
determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and
the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at
any time and from time to time upon request of the Borrower, deliver to the
Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in
determining any interest rate applicable to Domestic Revolving Loans pursuant to
this Agreement. Each change in the Applicable Base Rate Margin or Applicable
Eurodollar Margin or the Applicable Commitment Fee Percentage or any change in
the LC Commission as a result of a change in the Borrower's Most Recent Leverage
Ratio shall become effective on the date upon which such change in such ratio
occurs.

Section 3.4.      INTEREST PERIODS.

At the time it gives any Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion or
Continuation with respect to Eurocurrency Loans, the Borrower shall elect, by
giving the Administrative Agent written notice, the Interest Period (each an
"INTEREST PERIOD") which Interest Period shall, at the option of the Borrower,
be one, two, three or six months or, if available or otherwise satisfactory to
each of the applicable Lenders (as determined by each such applicable Lender in
its sole discretion) a nine or twelve month period, PROVIDED that:

                      (i) all Eurocurrency Loans comprising a Borrowing shall at
all times have the same Interest Period;

                      (ii) the initial Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Loan
shall commence on the date of such Borrowing of such Eurocurrency Loan
(including the date of any conversion thereto from a Loan of a different Type)
and each Interest Period occurring thereafter in respect of such Eurocurrency
Loan shall commence on the last day of the immediately preceding Interest
Period;

                      (iii) if any Interest Period relating to a Eurocurrency
Loan begins on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the
calendar month at the end of such


                                       66
<PAGE>

Interest Period, such Interest Period shall end on the last Business Day of such
calendar month;

                      (iv) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a
day which is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next
succeeding Business Day; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any Interest Period for a
Eurocurrency Loan would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day
but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such
month, such Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day;

                      (v) no Interest Period (a) with respect to any Loan (other
than a Multicurrency Revolving Loans) may be selected at any time when an
Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default is then in existence and (b) with
respect to any Multicurrency Revolving Loan in excess of one month may be
selected at any time when an Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default is
then in existence;

                      (vi) no Interest Period shall extend beyond the Term A
Loan Maturity Date for any Term A Loan, the New Term B Loan Maturity Date for
any New Term B Loan or the Revolver Termination Date for any Revolving Loan; and

                      (vii) no Interest Period in respect to any Borrowing of
Term A Loans or New Term B Loans, as the case may be, shall be selected which
extends beyond any date upon which a mandatory repayment of such Term Loans will
be required to be made under SECTION 4.4(b) or (c), as the case may be, if the
aggregate principal amount of Term A Loans or New Term B Loans, as the case may
be, which have Interest Periods which will expire after such date will be in
excess of the aggregate principal amount of Term A Loans or New Term B Loans, as
the case may be, then outstanding less the aggregate amount of such required
prepayment.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to the New Term B
Facility, the Borrower may only have Base Rate Loans and Eurocurrency Loans with
a one month Interest Period prior to the Syndicated Date.

Section 3.5.      COMPENSATION FOR FUNDING LOSSES.

The Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon its written request (which
request shall set forth the basis for requesting such amounts, showing the
calculation thereof in reasonable detail), for all losses, expenses and
liabilities (including, without limitation, any interest paid by such Lender to
lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or carry its Eurocurrency Loans to the
extent not recovered by the Lender in connection with the liquidation or
re-employment of such funds and including the compensation payable by such
Lender to a Participant) and any loss sustained by such Lender in connection
with the liquidation or re-employment of such funds (including, without
limitation, a return on such liquidation or re-employment that would result in
such Lender receiving less than it would have received had such Eurocurrency
Loan remained outstanding until the last day of the Interest Period applicable
to such Eurocurrency Loans) which


                                       67
<PAGE>

such Lender may sustain as a result of: (i) for any reason (other than a default
by such Lender or the Administrative Agent) a continuation or Borrowing of, or
conversion from or into, Eurocurrency Loans does not occur on a date specified
therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion or Continuation
(whether or not withdrawn); (ii) any payment, prepayment or conversion or
continuation of any of its Eurocurrency Loans occurring for any reason
whatsoever on a date which is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable
thereto; (iii) any repayment of any of its Eurocurrency Loans not being made on
the date specified in a notice of payment given by the Borrower; or (iv) (A) any
other failure by the Borrower to repay its Eurocurrency Loans when required by
the terms of this Agreement or (B) an election made by the Borrower pursuant to
SECTION 3.7. A written notice as to additional amounts owed such Lender under
this SECTION 3.5 and delivered to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by
such Lender shall be delivered within 30 days of such event and shall, absent
manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes. Calculation
of all amounts payable to a Lender under this SECTION 3.5 shall be made as
though that Lender had actually funded its relevant Eurocurrency Loan through
the purchase of a Eurocurrency deposit bearing interest at the Eurocurrency Rate
in an amount equal to the amount of that Loan, having a maturity comparable to
the relevant Interest Period and through the transfer of such Eurocurrency
deposit from an offshore office of that Lender to a domestic office of that
Lender in the United States of America; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each Lender may
fund each of its Eurocurrency Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing
assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of amounts payable under
this SECTION 3.5.

Section 3.6.      INCREASED COSTS, ILLEGALITY, ETC.

                  (a) GENERALLY. In the event that any Lender shall have
determined (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and
conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but, with respect to clause (i)
below, may be made only by the Administrative Agent):

                      (i) on any Interest Rate Determination Date that, by
reason of any changes arising after the Initial Borrowing Date affecting the
interbank Eurocurrency market, adequate and fair means do not exist for
ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the
definition of Eurocurrency Rate; or

                      (ii) at any time that any Lender shall incur increased
costs or reduction in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect
to any Eurocurrency Loan because of (x) any change since the Initial Borrowing
Date in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order or guideline
(whether or not having the force of law) or in the interpretation or
administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or
governmental rule, regulation, order or guideline, such as, for example, but not
limited to: (A) a change in the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender of
the principal of or interest on the Notes or any other amounts payable hereunder
(except for taxes described in SECTIONS 4.7(a)(i) through (IV)) or (B) a change
in official reserve requirements (but, in all events, excluding reserves
required under


                                       68
<PAGE>

Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of the Eurocurrency Rate)
and/or (y) other circumstances since the Initial Borrowing Date affecting such
Lender or the interbank Eurocurrency market or the position of such Lender in
such market (excluding, however, differences in a Lender's cost of funds from
those of the Administrative Agent which are solely the result of credit
differences between such Lender and the Administrative Agent); or

                      (iii) at any time that the making or continuance of any
Eurocurrency Loan has been made (x) unlawful by any law or governmental rule,
regulation or order, (y) impossible by compliance by any Lender in good faith
with any governmental guideline (whether or not having force of law) or (z)
impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the Initial Borrowing
Date which materially and adversely affects the interbank Eurocurrency market;

then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent, in the
case of clause (i) above) shall promptly give notice (by telephone confirmed in
writing) to the Borrower and, except in the case of clause (i) above, to the
Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative
Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders). Thereafter (x) in
the case of clause (i) above, Eurocurrency Loans shall no longer be available
until such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the
Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Administrative
Agent no longer exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion or
Continuation given by the Borrower with respect to Eurocurrency Loans (other
than with respect to conversions to Base Rate Loans) which have not yet been
incurred (including by way of conversion) shall be deemed rescinded by the
Borrower, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall pay to such
Lender, upon written demand therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an
increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise
as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as shall be required to
compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts
received or receivable hereunder (a written notice as to the additional amounts
owed to such Lender, showing the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to
the Borrower by such Lender shall, absent manifest error, be final and
conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto; however the failure to give
any such notice shall not release or diminish the Borrower's obligations to pay
additional amounts pursuant to this SECTION 3.6(a) provided that the Borrower
shall not be required to compensate such Lender pursuant to this section for any
increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that
such Lender notifies the Borrower of the increased costs or reductions and of
such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; PROVIDED FURTHER that,
if the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is
retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to
include the period of retroactive effect thereof and (z) in the case of clause
(iii) above, the Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in SECTION
3.6(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period
required by law. In determining such additional amounts pursuant to clause (y)
of the immediately preceding sentence, each Lender shall act reasonably and in
good faith and will, to the extent the increased costs or reductions in amounts
receivable relate to such Lender's loans in


                                       69
<PAGE>

general and are not specifically attributable to a Loan hereunder, use averaging
and attribution methods which are reasonable and which cover all loans similar
to the Loans made by such Lender whether or not the loan documentation for such
other loans permits the Lender to receive increased costs of the type described
in this SECTION 3.6(a).

                  (b) EUROCURRENCY LOANS. At any time that any Eurocurrency Loan
is affected by the circumstances described in SECTION 3.6(a)(ii) or (iii), the
Borrower may (and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Loan affected by the
circumstances described in SECTION 3.6(a)(iii), shall) either (i) if the
affected Eurocurrency Loan is then being made initially or pursuant to a
conversion, by giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed in
writing) on the same date that the Borrower was notified by the affected Lender
or the Administrative Agent pursuant to SECTION 3.6(a)(ii) or (iii), cancel the
respective Borrowing, or (ii) if the affected Eurocurrency Loan is then
outstanding, upon at least three (3) Business Days' written notice to
Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender to (A) if denominated in
Dollars, convert such Eurocurrency Loan into a Base Rate Loan, and (B) if
denominated in Euro, either (x) repay such Loan or (y) convert such Loan to a
Base Rate Loan denominated in Dollars, PROVIDED, that if more than one Lender is
affected at any time, then all affected Lenders must be treated the same
pursuant to this SECTION 3.6(b).

                  (c) CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. If any Lender determines that, after
the Initial Borrowing Date, the introduction of or any change in any applicable
law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or request (whether or
not having the force of law) concerning capital adequacy, or any change in
(after the Initial Borrowing Date) interpretation or administration thereof by
any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, will have the
effect of increasing the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained
by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender based on the existence
of such Lender's Commitments hereunder or its obligations hereunder, then the
Borrower shall pay to such Lender, upon its written notice as hereafter
described, such additional amounts as shall be required to compensate such
Lender or such other corporation for the increased cost to such Lender or such
other corporation or the reduction in the rate of return to such Lender or such
other corporation as a result of such increase of capital. In determining such
additional amounts, each Lender will act reasonably and in good faith and will
use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable and which will, to
the extent the increased costs or reduction in the rate of return relates to
such Lender's commitments or obligations in general and are not specifically
attributable to the Commitments and obligations hereunder, cover all commitments
and obligations similar to the Commitments and obligations of such Lender
hereunder whether or not the loan documentation for such other commitments or
obligations permits the Lender to make the determination specified in this
SECTION 3.6(c), and such Lender's determination of compensation owing under this
SECTION 3.6(c) shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding
on all the parties hereto. Each Lender, upon determining that any additional
amounts will be payable pursuant to this SECTION 3.6(c), will give prompt
written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall show the basis for
calculation of such additional amounts, although the failure to


                                       70
<PAGE>

give any such notice shall not release or diminish any of the Borrower's
obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this SECTION 3.6(c) PROVIDED
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate such Lender pursuant to
this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days
prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the increased costs
or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation thereof;
PROVIDED FURTHER that, if the change in law giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be
extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

                  (d) CHANGE OF LENDING OFFICE. Each Lender which is or will be
owed compensation pursuant to SECTION 3.6(a) or (c) or SECTION 4.7 will, if
requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy
considerations of such Lender) to cause a different branch or Affiliate to make
or continue a Loan or Letter of Credit if such designation will avoid the need
for, or materially reduce the amount of, such compensation to such Lender and
will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such
Lender as determined by such Lender in its sole discretion. Nothing in this
SECTION 3.6(d) shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower
or the right of any Lender provided for herein.

Section 3.7.      REPLACEMENT OF AFFECTED LENDERS.

                  (a) If any Revolving Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or
otherwise defaults in its Obligations to make Loans or fund Unpaid Drawings, (y)
if any Lender (or in the case of SECTION 2.10(i), any Facing Agent) is owed
increased costs under SECTION 2.10(i), SECTION 3.6(a)(ii) or (iii), or SECTION
3.6(c), or the Borrower is required to make any payments under SECTION 4.7(c) to
any Lender materially in excess of those to the other Lenders or (z) as provided
in SECTION 12.1(b) in the case of certain refusals by a Lender to consent to
certain proposed amendments, changes, supplements, waivers, discharges or
terminations with respect to this Agreement which have been approved by the
Required Lenders, the Borrower shall have the right, if no Event of Default or
Unmatured Event of Default then exists, to replace such Lender (the "REPLACED
LENDER") with one or more other Eligible Assignees, none of whom shall
constitute a Defaulting Lender at the time of such replacement (collectively,
the "REPLACEMENT LENDER") acceptable to the Administrative Agent, PROVIDED that
(i) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this SECTION 3.7, the Replaced
Lender and Replacement Lender shall enter into one or more assignment
agreements, in form and substance satisfactory to such parties and the
Administrative Agent, pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire all
of the Commitments and outstanding Loans of, and participation in Letters of
Credit and Swing Line Loans by, the Replaced Lender and (ii) all obligations of
the Borrower owing to the Replaced Lender (including, without limitation, such
increased costs and excluding those specifically described in clause (i) above
in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is concurrently
being paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender concurrently with such
replacement. Upon the execution of the respective assignment documentation, the
payment of amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above and, if so
requested by the Replacement Lender,


                                       71
<PAGE>

delivery to the Replacement Lender of the appropriate Note or Notes executed by
the Borrower, the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and, unless
the Replaced Lender continues to have outstanding Loans hereunder, the Replaced
Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder, except with respect to
indemnification provisions under this Agreement, which shall survive as to such
Replaced Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, no
Lender that acts as a Facing Agent may be replaced hereunder at any time during
which it has Letters of Credit outstanding hereunder unless arrangements
satisfactory to, such Facing Agent (including the furnishing of a standby letter
of credit in form and substance, and issued by an issuer satisfactory to such
Facing Agent or the depositing of cash collateral into the Collateral Account in
amounts and pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to such Facing Agent) have
been made with respect to such outstanding Letters of Credit.

Section 3.8.      BORROWER CONTROLS ON NON-DOLLAR LOANS; PREPAYMENTS.

                  (a) The Borrower will implement and maintain internal
accounting controls to monitor the borrowings and repayments of Multicurrency
Revolving Loans and the issuance of and drawings under Multicurrency Letters of
Credit with the object of preventing any request for an extension of credit that
would result in the Borrower failing to comply with this Agreement, and of
promptly identifying and remedying any circumstance in accordance with clause
(c) below where, by reason of changes in exchange rates, the Borrower fails to
be in compliance with such subsection.

                  (b) The Administrative Agent will calculate the Multicurrency
Outstandings (i) three (3) Business Days prior to the date of a proposed
Borrowing or, if applicable, date of conversion/continuation of a Loan, (ii) on
and as of the first Business Day of each calendar month, and (iii) any other
Business Day elected by the Administrative Agent in its discretion or upon
instruction of the Required Lenders. Each day upon or as of which the
Administrative Agent determines the Multicurrency Outstandings described in the
preceding clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) is herein described as a "COMPUTATION
DATE" with respect to each Loan or LC Obligation for which a Dollar Equivalent
amount is determined on or as of such day.

                  (c) In the event that the Borrower (in accordance with
paragraph (a) above) or the Administrative Agent (in accordance with (b) above)
determines that the Multicurrency Outstandings exceed the Multicurrency
Commitment by more than 5%, the Borrower will, within four (4) Business Days of
making such determination or of the Computation Date, as applicable, make or
cause to be made such repayments or prepayments of Multicurrency Revolving Loans
or cash collateralize Multicurrency LC Obligations on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, pursuant to SECTION 4.4(a), as shall
be necessary to reduce the Multicurrency Outstandings to less than or equal to
the Multicurrency Commitment.


                                       72
<PAGE>

                  (d) Any prepayment pursuant to subsection (c) above shall be
accompanied by payment of amounts payable, if any, pursuant to SECTION 3.5.

                                   ARTICLE IV

               REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS; PAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS

Section 4.1.      VOLUNTARY REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS.

                  (a) Upon at least three (3) Business Days' prior written
notice (or telephonic notice confirmed in writing) to the Administrative Agent
at the Notice Office (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly
transmit to each Lender), the Borrower shall have the right, without premium or
penalty, to terminate the unutilized portion of the Revolving Commitments
and/or, the Swing Line Commitment, as the case may be, in part or in whole;
PROVIDED that (w) any such voluntary termination of the Revolving Commitments
shall apply to proportionately and permanently reduce the Revolving Commitment
of each Revolving Lender, (x) any partial voluntary reduction pursuant to this
SECTION 4.1 shall be in the amount of at least $1,000,000 and integral multiples
of $500,000 in excess of that amount, and (y) any such voluntary termination of
the Revolving Commitments shall occur simultaneously with a voluntary prepayment
pursuant to SECTION 4.3, such that the total of the Revolving Commitments shall
not be reduced below the aggregate Assigned Dollar Value of outstanding
Revolving Loans plus the Assigned Dollar Value of the aggregate LC Obligations
and the Assigned Dollar Value of the Swing Line Loans.

                  (b) In the event of certain refusals by a Lender to consent to
certain proposed changes, waivers, discharges or terminations with respect to
this Agreement which have been approved by the Required Lenders as provided in
SECTION 12.1(b), the Borrower shall have the right, upon five (5) Business Days'
prior written notice to the Administrative Agent (which notice the
Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders), to
terminate the entire Revolving Commitment of such Lender, so long as all Loans,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, fees and all other amounts, due and
owing to such Lender are repaid concurrently with the effectiveness of such
termination at which time SCHEDULE 1.1(a) shall be deemed modified to reflect
such changed amounts pursuant to SECTION 4.3(b) and the Borrower cash
collateralizes such Lender's Revolver Pro Rata Share of the Assigned Dollar
Value of the LC Obligations (in the manner set forth in SECTION 4.4(a)) then
outstanding. At such time, such Lender shall no longer constitute a "Lender" for
purposes of this Agreement, except with respect to indemnifications in favor of
such Lender under this Agreement which shall survive as to such repaid Lender.



                                       73
<PAGE>

Section 4.2.      Mandatory Reductions of Commitments.

                  (a) REDUCTION OF REVOLVING COMMITMENT. The Revolving
Commitments shall be reduced at the time and in the amounts required to be
reduced pursuant to SECTION 4.4(d) and (j), subject to the provisions of this
Agreement.

                  (b) REDUCTION OF NEW TERM B COMMITMENTS. The New Term B
Commitments shall terminate on the Amendment/Restatement Effective Date, after
giving effect to the Borrowing of the New Term B Loans on such date.

                  (c) PROPORTIONATE REDUCTIONS. Each reduction or adjustment to
the Term Commitments or the Revolving Commitments pursuant to this SECTION 4.2
shall apply proportionately to the New Term B Commitment or the Revolving
Commitment, as the case may be, of each Lender.

Section 4.3.      VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS.

                  (a) The Borrower shall have the right to prepay the Loans in
whole or in part, from time to time, without premium or penalty, on the
following terms and conditions: (i) the Borrower shall give the Administrative
Agent irrevocable written notice at its Notice Office (or telephonic notice
promptly confirmed in writing) of its intent to prepay the Loans, whether such
Loans are Term Loans, Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans, the amount and
currency, if applicable, of such prepayment and the specific Borrowings to which
such prepayment is to be applied, which notice shall be given by the Borrower to
the Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least three (3)
Business Days prior in the case of Eurocurrency Loans and at least one Business
Day prior in the case of Base Rate Loans to the date of such prepayment and
which notice shall (except in the case of Swing Line Loans) promptly be
transmitted by the Administrative Agent to each of the applicable Lenders; (ii)
each partial prepayment of any Borrowing (other than a Borrowing of Swing Line
Loans) shall be in an aggregate Dollar Equivalent principal amount of at least
$1,000,000 and each partial prepayment of a Swing Line Loan shall be in an
aggregate principal amount of at least $100,000; PROVIDED, that no partial
prepayment of Eurocurrency Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing shall
reduce the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Loans made pursuant to
such Borrowing to an amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable
thereto; (iii) Eurocurrency Loans may only be prepaid pursuant to this SECTION
4.3 on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto or on any other day
subject to SECTION 3.5; (iv) each prepayment in respect of any Borrowing shall
be applied pro rata among the Loans comprising such Borrowing; PROVIDED, that
such prepayment shall not be applied to any Revolving Loans of a Defaulting
Lender at any time when the aggregate amount of Revolving Loans of any
Non-Defaulting Lender exceeds such Non-Defaulting Lender's Revolver Pro Rata
Share of all Revolving Loans then outstanding; (v) each voluntary prepayment of
Term Loans shall be applied to the Scheduled Term A Repayments and Scheduled New
Term B Repayments due


                                       74
<PAGE>

within the 12 month period following the date of such prepayment in direct order
of maturity and, thereafter, subject to SECTION 4.5(0) shall be applied in
proportional amounts equal to the Term A Percentage and the New Term B
Percentage (in each case, after giving effect to the prepayments made to the
Scheduled Term A Repayments and the Scheduled New Term B Repayments due within
such twelve month period as specified above), as the case may be, of such
remaining prepayment, if any, and within each Term Loan, shall be applied to
reduce the remaining Scheduled Term A Repayments and Scheduled New Term B
Repayments on a pro rata basis (based upon the then remaining principal amount
of such Scheduled Term A Repayments and Scheduled New Term B Repayments,
respectively). Unless otherwise specified by the Borrower, such prepayment shall
be applied first to the payment of Base Rate Loans and second to the payment of
such Eurocurrency Loans as the Borrower shall request (and in the absence of
such request, as the Administrative Agent shall determine). In the event that
any New Term B Lender waives all or part of its right to receive its portion of
a voluntary prepayment pursuant to SECTION 4.5(c), the Administrative Agent
shall apply one hundred percent (100%) of the amount so waived, if any, by such
New Term B Lender pro-rata to the Term A Loans in accordance with this SECTION
4.3(a). The notice provisions, the provisions with respect to the minimum amount
of any prepayment, and the provisions requiring prepayments in integral
multiples above such minimum amount of this SECTION 4.3 are for the benefit of
the Administrative Agent and may be waived unilaterally by the Administrative
Agent.

                  (b) In the event of certain refusals by a Lender to consent to
certain proposed changes, waivers, discharges or terminations with respect to
this Agreement which have been approved by the Required Lenders as provided in
SECTION 12.1(b), the Borrower shall have the right, upon five (5) Business Days'
prior written notice to the Administrative Agent (which notice the
Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders), to repay
all Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest, fees and all other amounts
due and owing to such Lender in accordance with said SECTION 12.1(b), so long as
(A) in the case of the repayment of Revolving Loans of any Revolving Lender
pursuant to this CLAUSE (B), the Revolving Commitment of such Revolving Lender
is terminated concurrently with such repayment pursuant to SECTION 4.1(b), and
(b) in the case of the repayment of Loans of any Lender, the consents required
by SECTION 12.1(b) in connection with the repayment pursuant to this CLAUSE (B)
shall have been obtained.

Section 4.4.      MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS.

                  (a) PREPAYMENT UPON OVERADVANCE. The Borrower shall prepay the
outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans on any
date on which (x) the aggregate outstanding Assigned Dollar Value of such
Revolving Loans and such Swing Line Loans together with the Assigned Dollar
Value of the aggregate LC Obligations (after giving effect to any other
repayments or prepayments on such day) exceeds the Total Revolving Commitments
or (y) the aggregate outstanding Multicurrency Outstandings (after giving effect
to any other repayments or prepayments on such day) exceeds the total
Multicurrency Commitment


                                       75
<PAGE>

in the amount equal to the greater of either such excess. If, after giving
effect to the prepayment of all outstanding Revolving Loans and Swing Line
Loans, (A) the Assigned Dollar Value of the aggregate LC Obligations exceeds the
Total Revolving Commitment then in effect, or (B) the Assigned Dollar Value of
the aggregate Multicurrency Obligations exceeds the Multicurrency Commitment
then in effect, then, in either case, the Borrower shall cash collateralize LC
Obligations by depositing, pursuant to a cash collateral agreement to be entered
into in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent,
cash with Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the difference between the
Assigned Dollar Value of such LC Obligations and the Total Revolving Commitment
then in effect (or the Multicurrency LC Obligation and the Multicurrency
Commitment, as the case may be). The Administrative Agent shall establish in its
name for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders a cash collateral account (the
"COLLATERAL ACCOUNT") into which it shall deposit such cash to hold as
collateral security for the LC Obligations.

                  (b) SCHEDULED TERM A REPAYMENTS. The Borrower shall cause to
be paid Scheduled Term A Repayments on the Term A Loans until the Term A Loans
are paid in full in the amounts and at the times specified in the definition of
Scheduled Term A Repayments to the extent that prepayments have not previously
been applied to such Scheduled Term A Repayments (and such Scheduled Term A
Repayments have not otherwise been reduced) pursuant to the terms hereof. To the
extent not previously paid, all Term A Loans shall be due and payable on the
Term A Maturity Date.

                  (c) SCHEDULED NEW TERM B REPAYMENTS. The Borrower shall cause
to be paid Scheduled New Term B Repayments on the New Term B Loans until the New
Term B Loans are paid in full in the amounts and at the times specified in the
definition of Scheduled New Term B Repayments to the extent that prepayments
have not previously been applied to such Scheduled New Term B Repayments (and
such Scheduled New Term B Repayments have not otherwise been reduced) pursuant
to the terms hereof. To the extent not previously paid, all New Term B Loans
shall be due and payable on the New Term B Loan Maturity Date.

                  (d) MANDATORY PREPAYMENT UPON ASSET DISPOSITION. On the first
Business Day or, in the case of an Asset Disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary of
the Borrower, such later date (but in any event not later than the 365th day)
after the date of receipt thereof by the Borrower and/or any of its Subsidiaries
of Net Sale Proceeds from any Asset Disposition, an amount equal to 100% of the
Net Sale Proceeds from such Asset Disposition shall be applied as a mandatory
repayment of principal of the Term Loans pursuant to the terms of SECTION 4.5(a)
(in each case subject to modification of such application as set forth in
SECTION 4.5(c)), PROVIDED, that with respect to no more than the Dollar
Equivalent of $25,000,000 in the aggregate of such Net Sale Proceeds in any
Fiscal Year of the Borrower, the Net Sale Proceeds therefrom shall not be
required to be so applied on such date to the extent that no Event of Default or
Unmatured Event of Default then exists and the Borrower delivers a certificate
to the Administrative Agent on or prior to such date stating that such Net Sale
Proceeds are expected to be used to purchase assets


                                       76
<PAGE>

used or to be used in the businesses referred to in SECTION 8.9 within 365 days
following the date of such Asset Disposition (which certificate shall set forth
the estimates of the proceeds to be so expended), PROVIDED, FURTHER, that (1) if
all or any portion of such Net Sale Proceeds not so applied to the repayment of
Term Loans are not so used (or contractually committed to be used) within such
365 day period as provided above, such remaining portion shall be applied on the
last day of the period as a mandatory repayment of principal of outstanding Term
Loans as provided above in this SECTION 4.4(d) and (2) if all or any portion of
such Net Sale Proceeds are a result of an Asset Disposition involving the sale
of Collateral owned by the Borrower or a Subsidiary (other than the Capital
Stock of a Foreign Subsidiary), then such Net Sale Proceeds shall be required to
be reinvested in assets constituting Collateral. After the prepayment in full of
all Term Loans, the Borrower shall repay Revolving Loans, pro rata, and
thereafter, cash collateralize LC Obligations on the date of receipt of such
proceeds by an amount equal to the lesser of (y) the Assigned Dollar Value of
Revolving Loans and LC Obligations then outstanding or (z) the remaining portion
of such Net Sale Proceeds not used to repay Term Loans, and the Revolving
Commitments shall be permanently reduced, pro rata, by that portion of Net Sale
Proceeds not used to repay Term Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing or the
terms of SECTION 4.5(a), if, as of the date of any prepayment from Net Sale
Proceeds required pursuant to this SECTION 4.4(d), the Leverage Ratio of the
Borrower, calculated for the Test Period ending on the last day of the most
recently ended Fiscal Quarter, is less than 2.50 to 1.00, the Borrower may
elect, in its sole discretion, to apply 100% of such Net Sale Proceeds (x) to
purchase assets used or to be used in the businesses referred to in SECTION 8.9,
(y) to repay, pro rata, Term A Loans and New Term B Loans or (z) to repay, pro
rata, Revolving Loans (without a permanent reduction of the Revolving
Commitments).

                  (e) MANDATORY PREPAYMENT WITH EXCESS CASH FLOW. On each Excess
Cash Payment Date, an amount equal to 50% of Excess Cash Flow of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries for the relevant Excess Cash Flow Period shall be applied
as a mandatory repayment of principal of the Term Loans pursuant to the terms of
SECTION 4.5(a) (in each case subject to modification of such application as set
forth in SECTION 4.5(c)); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if as of the last day of the
relevant Excess Cash Flow Period, the Leverage Ratio is less than 2.50 to 1.00,
the amount required to be paid pursuant to this SECTION 4.4(e) shall be 0%.

                  (f) MANDATORY PAYMENT WITH PROCEEDS OF CAPITAL STOCK. On the
first Business Day after receipt thereof by the Borrower and/or any of their
Subsidiaries, an amount equal to 100% of the Net Offering Proceeds of the sale
or issuance of Capital Stock of (or cash capital contributions to) the Borrower
or any of their Subsidiaries shall be applied as a mandatory repayment of
principal of the Term Loans pursuant to the terms of SECTION 4.5(a) (in each
case subject to modification of such application as set forth in SECTION
4.5(c)). Notwithstanding the foregoing or the terms of SECTION 4.5(a), if, as of
the date of any prepayment from Net Offering Proceeds required pursuant to this
SECTION 4.4(f), the Leverage Ratio of the Borrower, calculated for the Test
Period ending on the last day of the most recently ended Fiscal Quarter, is less
than 2.50 to 1.00, the Borrower may elect, in its sole discretion, to apply 100%
of such Net Offering


                                       77
<PAGE>

Proceeds (x) to purchase assets used or to be used in the businesses referred to
in SECTION 8.9, (y) to repay, pro rata, Term A Loans and New Term B Loans or (z)
to repay, pro rata, Revolving Loans (without a permanent reduction of the
Revolving Commitments).

                  (g) MANDATORY PAYMENT WITH PROCEEDS OF SALE AND LEASEBACK
TRANSACTION. On the Business Day of receipt thereof by the Borrower and/or any
of its Subsidiaries, an amount equal to 100% of net cash proceeds from a Sale
and Leaseback Transaction by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
applied as a mandatory repayment of principal of the Term Loans pursuant to the
terms of SECTION 4.5(a) (in each case subject to modification of such
application as set forth in SECTION 4.5(c)). Notwithstanding the foregoing or
the terms of SECTION 4.5(a), if, as of the date of any prepayment from net cash
proceeds of a Sale and Leaseback Transaction required pursuant to this SECTION
4.4(g), the Leverage Ratio of the Borrower, calculated for the Test Period
ending on the last day of the most recently ended Fiscal Quarter, is less than
2.50 to 1.00, the Borrower may elect, in its sole discretion, to apply 100% of
such net cash proceeds (x) to purchase assets used or to be used in the
businesses referred to in SECTION 8.9, (y) to repay, pro rata, Term A Loans and
New Term B Loans or (z) to repay, pro rata, Revolving Loans (without a permanent
reduction of the Revolving Commitments).

                  (h) MANDATORY PREPAYMENT UPON INCURRENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS. On
the Business Day of receipt thereof by the Borrower, an amount equal to 100% of
the Net Offering Proceeds of any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness permitted
by SECTION 8.2) hereof shall be applied as a mandatory repayment of principal of
the Term Loans pursuant to the terms of SECTION 4.5(a), subject to modification
of such application as set forth in SECTION 4.5(c). Notwithstanding the
foregoing or the terms of SECTION 4.5(a), if, as of the date of any prepayment
from Net Offering Proceeds required pursuant to this SECTION 4.4(h), the
Leverage Ratio of the Borrower, calculated for the Test Period ending on the
last day of the most recently ended Fiscal Quarter, is less than 2.50 to 1.00,
the Borrower may elect, in its sole discretion, to apply 100% of such Net
Offering Proceeds (x) to purchase assets used or to be used in the businesses
referred to in SECTION 8.9, (y) to repay, pro rata, Term A Loans and New Term B
Loans or (z) to repay, pro rata, Revolving Loans (without a permanent reduction
of the Revolving Commitments).

                  (i) MANDATORY PREPAYMENT UPON PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT. On
the Business Day following receipt of the net cash proceeds of any payment by
the OTS Seller to the Borrower pursuant to any adjustment to the Purchase Price
(as such term is defined in the OTS Business Acquisition Agreement) an amount
equal to 100% of such payment shall be applied as a mandatory repayment of
principal of the Term Loans pursuant to the terms of SECTION 4.5(a), subject to
modification of such application as set forth in SECTION 4.5(c)); PROVIDED that
no such payment shall be required to be so applied if the proceeds of such
adjustment do not equal or exceed $5,000,000.00.

                  (j) MANDATORY PAYMENT UPON RECOVERY EVENT. Within ten (10)
days following each date on which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
receives any proceeds from


                                       78
<PAGE>


any Recovery Event, an amount equal to 100% of the proceeds of such Recovery
Event (net of reasonable costs and taxes incurred in connection with such
Recovery Event and amounts due to the federal government of the United States in
satisfaction of any contractual obligation of the Borrower thereto) shall be
applied as a mandatory repayment of principal of the Term Loans as provided in
SECTION 4.5 in each case subject to modification of such application as set
forth in SECTION 4.5(d), PROVIDED that (1) so long as no Event of Default or
Unmatured Event of Default then exists, if the net proceeds from any Recovery
Event are less than the Dollar Equivalent of $10,000,000, then no prepayment
shall be required pursuant to this SECTION 4.4(j), and (2) so long as no Event
of Default or Unmatured Event of Default then exists, with respect to any single
or series of related Recovery Events the net proceeds therefrom which are equal
to or greater than the Dollar Equivalent of $10,000,000 but less than the Dollar
Equivalent of $25,000,000, such proceeds shall not be required to be so applied
on such date to the extent that (x) Borrower has delivered a certificate to the
Administrative Agent on or prior to such date stating that such proceeds shall
be used to replace or restore any properties or assets in respect of which such
proceeds were paid within 365 days following the date of the receipt of such
proceeds (which certificate shall set forth the estimates of the proceeds to be
so expended) and (y) such proceeds are deposited in an escrow account with
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors (the "RECOVERY
EVENT ESCROW ACCOUNT") (PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Borrower has satisfied
the last sentence of this SECTION 4.4(j), no such escrow account shall be
established with the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall retain control
of such proceeds), from which interest-bearing escrow account amounts may be
withdrawn only to repay the Term Loans or to be used for the purposes described
in clause (x) above, PROVIDED, FURTHER, that (i) if the amount of such proceeds
from any single or series of related Recovery Events exceeds the Dollar
Equivalent of $25,000,000, then the entire amount and not just the portion in
excess of the Dollar Equivalent of $25,000,000 shall be applied as a mandatory
repayment of Term Loans as provided above in this SECTION 4.4(j), (ii) if all or
any portion of such proceeds not required to be applied to the repayment of Term
Loans pursuant to the first proviso of this SECTION 4.4(j) are not so used (or
contractually committed to be used) within 365 days after the day of the receipt
of such proceeds, such remaining portion shall be applied on the last day of
such period as a mandatory repayment of principal of the Term Loans as provided
in this SECTION 4.4(j) and (iii) if all or any portion of such proceeds are not
required to be applied on the 365th day referred to in clause (ii) above because
such amount is contractually committed to be used and subsequent to such date
such contract is terminated or expires without such portion being so used, then
such remaining portion shall be applied on the date of such termination or
expiration as a mandatory repayment of principal of outstanding Term Loans as
provided in this SECTION 4.4(j). After the prepayment in full of all Term Loans,
the Borrower shall repay Revolving Loans pro rata, and thereafter, cash
collateralize LC Obligations on the date of receipt of such proceeds by an
amount equal to the lesser of (y) the Assigned Dollar Value of Revolving Loans
and LC Obligations then outstanding or (z) the remaining portion of such net
proceeds not used to repay Term Loans, and the Revolving Commitments shall be
permanently reduced, pro rata, by that portion of net proceeds not used to repay
Term Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing or the terms of SECTION 4.5(a), if, as
of the date of any prepayment from net proceeds of any Recovery Event required
pursuant to


                                       79
<PAGE>


this SECTION 4.4(j), the Leverage Ratio of the Borrower, calculated for the Test
Period ending on the last day of the most recently ended Fiscal Quarter, is less
than 2.50 to 1.00, the Borrower may elect, in its sole discretion, to apply 100%
of such net proceeds (x) to purchase assets used or to be used in the businesses
referred to in SECTION 8.9, (y) to repay, pro rata, Term A Loans and New Term B
Loans or (z) to repay, pro rata, Revolving Loans (without a permanent reduction
of the Revolving Commitments).

Section 4.5.      APPLICATION OF PREPAYMENTS; WAIVER OF CERTAIN PREPAYMENTS.

                  (a) PREPAYMENTS. Subject in all events to the final proviso
set forth in SECTION 4.4(d), (f), (g), (h) and (j) and except as otherwise
expressly provided in SECTION 4.4(d) and (j), all prepayments of principal made
by the Borrower pursuant to SECTION 4.4 (other than with respect to 4.4(A), (B)
and (C) shall be applied to repay the Term A Loans and the New Term B Loans
(with the Term A Percentage of such repayment to be applied as a repayment of
Term A Loans and the New Term B Percentage of such repayment to be applied as a
repayment of New Term B Loans). Any prepayment of Loans pursuant to SECTION
4.4(d) and (j) shall be applied (i) FIRST, to the payment of the unpaid
principal amount of the Term A Loans and the New Term B Loans (with the Term A
Percentage of such repayment to be applied as a repayment of Term A Loans and
the New Term B Percentage of such repayment to be applied as a repayment of New
Term B Loans), SECOND, to the prepayment of the then outstanding balance of
Swing Line Loans, THIRD, to the payment, pro rata, of the then outstanding
balance of the Revolving Loans, and FOURTH, to the cash collateralization of LC
Obligations; (ii) within each of the foregoing Loans, first to the payment of
Base Rate Loans and second to the payment of Eurocurrency Loans; and (iii) with
respect to Eurocurrency Loans, in such order as the Borrower shall request (and
in the absence of such request, as the Administrative Agent shall determine).
Each prepayment of Term Loans made pursuant to SECTION 4.4(d), (e), (f), (g),
(h) and (j) shall be allocated FIRST to the Term A Loans and the New Term B
Loans based on the aggregate principal amount of the Scheduled Term A Repayments
and the Scheduled New Term B Repayments due within the twelve month period
following the date of such prepayment in direct order of maturity, and,
thereafter, shall be allocated SECOND to the Term A Loans and the New Term B
Loans in proportional amounts equal to the Term A Percentage and the New Term B
Percentage (in each case, after giving effect to the prepayments made to the
Scheduled Term A Repayments and Scheduled New Term B Repayments due within such
twelve month period as specified above), as the case may be, of such remaining
prepayment, if any, and, within each Term A Loan or New Term B Loan, shall be
applied to reduce the remaining Scheduled Term A Repayments and Scheduled New
Term B Repayments on a pro rata basis (based upon the then remaining principal
amount of such Scheduled Term A Repayments and Scheduled New Term B Repayments,
respectively). Any prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to SECTION 4.4(i) shall be
applied pro rata to each of the Scheduled Term A Repayments and Scheduled New
Term B Repayments. If any prepayment of Eurocurrency Loans made pursuant to a
single Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding Loans made pursuant to such
Borrowing to an amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount, such Borrowing
shall immediately be converted into Base Rate Loans, in the case of Loans


                                       80
<PAGE>

denominated in Dollars, or into Loans with a one month Interest Period, in the
case of Loans denominated in Euro. All prepayments shall include payment of
accrued interest on the principal amount so prepaid, shall be applied to the
payment of interest before application to principal and shall include amounts
payable, if any, under SECTION 3.5.

                  (b) PAYMENTS. All Scheduled Repayments shall be applied (i)
first to the payment of Base Rate Loans, if any, and second to the payment of
Eurocurrency Loans and (ii) with respect to Eurocurrency Loans, in such order as
the Borrower shall request (and in the absence of such request, as the
Administrative Agent shall determine). All payments shall include payment of
accrued interest on the principal amount so paid, shall be applied to the
payment of interest before application to principal and shall include amounts
payable, if any, under SECTION 3.5.

                  (c) WAIVER OF CERTAIN PREPAYMENTS BY NEW TERM B LENDERS.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this SECTION 4.5 with
respect to any voluntary prepayment or mandatory prepayment of New Term B Loans
otherwise required pursuant to SECTIONS 4.3, 4.4(d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i) AND
(j), if the Borrower has given the Administrative Agent written notification
that the Borrower has elected, in its sole discretion, to give each Lender with
a New Term B Loan the right to waive such Lender's rights to receive its PRO
RATA percentage of such prepayment (any such repayment, a "WAIVABLE
PREPAYMENT"), the Administrative Agent shall notify such Lenders thereof and the
amount required to be applied to each such Lender's New Term B Loans pursuant to
the Waivable Prepayment. In the event any such Lender desires to waive its right
to receive any or all of its percentage of the Waivable Prepayment, such Lender
shall so advise the Administrative Agent in writing no later than 5:00 P.M. (New
York time) two (2) Business Days after the date of such notice from the
Administrative Agent, which reply shall also include the amount, if any, of its
portion of the Waivable Prepayment that such Lender still desires to receive. If
any such Lender does not reply to the Administrative Agent within the two (2)
Business Day period or responds but does not specify the amount of the Waivable
Prepayment that such Lender wishes to receive, if any, such Lender will be
deemed to have elected to receive 100% of the Waivable Prepayment. In the event
that any such New Term B Lender waives its right to any such Waivable
Prepayment, the Administrative Agent shall apply 100% of the amount so waived by
such New Term B Lenders to prepay the Term A Loans as otherwise provided in this
SECTION 4.5. All payments of the New Term B Loans shall be made PRO RATA,
reduced for any New Term B Lender who has waived any of its portion of a
Waivable Prepayment by the amount so waived.

                  (d) CONVERSION OF CURRENCY. If any payment made under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document is made in a currency other than the
Specified Currency expressed to be payable herein, the Administrative Agent is
authorized to, and at its sole election may, convert such currency to the
Specified Currency prior to distribution to the Lenders. All such conversions of
currency shall be subject to SECTION 3.5.



                                       81

Section 4.6.      METHOD AND PLACE OF PAYMENT.

                  (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all
payments under this Agreement shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the
ratable account of the Lenders entitled thereto, not later than 1:00 p.m. (New
York City time) on the date when due and shall be made in immediately available
funds and in each case to the account specified therefor for the Administrative
Agent or if no account has been so specified at the Payment Office. The
Administrative Agent will thereafter cause to be distributed on the same day (if
payment was actually received by the Administrative Agent prior to 1:00 p.m.
(New York City time) on such day) like funds relating to the payment of
principal or interest or fees ratably to the Lenders entitled to receive any
such payment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If and to the
extent that any such distribution shall not be so made by the Administrative
Agent in full on the same day (if payment was actually received by the
Administrative Agent prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such day), the
Administrative Agent shall pay to each Lender its ratable amount thereof and
each such Lender shall be entitled to receive from the Administrative Agent,
upon demand, interest on such amount at the overnight Federal Funds Rate (or the
applicable cost of funds with respect to amounts denominated in Euro) for each
day from the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent until the date
the Administrative Agent pays such amount to such Lender.

                  (b) Any payments under this Agreement which are made by the
Borrower later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) shall, for the purpose of
calculation of interest, be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding
Business Day. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be
due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended
to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal,
interest shall be payable during such extension at the applicable rate in effect
immediately prior to such extension, except that with respect to Eurocurrency
Loans, if such next succeeding applicable Business Day is not in the same month
as the date on which such payment would otherwise be due hereunder or under any
Note, the due date with respect thereto shall be the next preceding Business
Day.

Section 4.7.      NET PAYMENTS.

                  (a) All payments made by the Borrower hereunder or under any
Loan Document will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense. Except
as provided in SECTION 4.7(d), all payments hereunder and under any of the Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, payments on account of principal and
interest and fees) shall be made by the Borrower free and clear of and without
deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, duty,
levy, impost, assessment or other charge of whatever nature now or hereafter
imposed by any Governmental Authority, but excluding therefrom (i) a tax imposed
on or measured by the overall net income (including a franchise tax based on net
income) of the lending office of the Lender in respect of which the payment is
made by the jurisdiction in which the Lender is


                                       82
<PAGE>

incorporated or the jurisdiction (or political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof) in which its lending office is located, (ii) in the case of any Lender
organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any
state thereof (including the District of Columbia), any taxes imposed by the
United States by means of withholding at the source unless such withholding
results from a change in applicable law, treaty or regulations or the
interpretation or administration thereof (including, without limitation, any
guideline or policy not having the force of law) by any authority charged with
the administration thereof subsequent to the date such Lender becomes a Lender
with respect to the Loan or portion thereof affected by such change, (iii) any
taxes to which the Lender is subject (to the extent of the tax rate then in
effect) on the date this Agreement is executed or to which such Lender would be
subject on such date if a payment hereunder had been received by the Lender on
such date and with respect to any Lender that becomes a party hereto after the
Initial Borrowing Date, any taxes to which such Lender is subject on the date it
becomes a party hereto (other than taxes which each of the other Lenders is
entitled to reimbursements for pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) and (iv)
taxes to which the Lender becomes subject subsequent to the date referred to in
clause (iii) above as a result of a change in the residence, place of
incorporation, or principal place of business of the Lender, a change in the
branch or lending office of the Lender participating in the transactions set
forth herein or other similar circumstances or as a result of the recognition by
the Lender of gain on the sale, assignment or participation by the Lender of the
participating interests in its creditor positions hereunder (such tax or taxes,
other than excluded tax or taxes being herein referred to as "TAX" or "TAXES").
If the Borrower is required by law to make any deduction or withholding of any
Taxes from any payment due hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents, then
the amount payable will be increased to such amount which, after deduction from
such increased amount of all such Taxes required to be withheld or deducted
therefrom, will not be less than the amount due and payable hereunder had no
such deduction or withholding been required. A certificate as to any additional
amounts payable to a Lender under this SECTION 4.7 submitted to the Borrower by
such Lender shall show in reasonable detail the amount payable and the
calculations used to determine in good faith such amount and shall, absent
manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto.

                  (b) If the Borrower makes any payment hereunder or under any
of the Loan Documents in respect of which it is required by law to make any
deduction or withholding of any Taxes, it shall pay the full amount to be
deducted or withheld to the relevant taxation or other authority within the time
allowed for such payment under applicable law and shall deliver to the Lenders
within 60 days after it has made such payment to the applicable authority a
receipt issued by such authority evidencing the payment to such authority of all
amounts so required to be deducted or withheld from such payment.

                  (c) Without prejudice to the other provisions of SECTION 4.7,
if any Lender, or the Administrative Agent on its behalf, is required by law to
make any payment on account of Taxes on or in relation to any amount received or
receivable hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents by such Lender, or the
Administrative Agent on its behalf, or any liability for Tax in


                                       83
<PAGE>

respect of any such payment is imposed, levied or assessed against any Lender or
the Administrative Agent on its behalf, the Borrower will promptly, following
receipt of the certificate described in the immediately following sentence,
indemnify such person against such Tax payment or liability, together with any
interest, penalties and expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and
expenses) payable or incurred in connection therewith, including any tax of any
Lender arising by virtue of payments under this SECTION 4.7(c), computed in a
manner consistent with this SECTION 4.7(c). A certificate as to the amount of
such payment by such Lender, or the Administrative Agent on its behalf, showing
calculations thereof in reasonable detail, absent manifest error, shall be
final, conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto for all purposes.

                  (d) Each Lender that is not a United States person (as such
term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) agrees to deliver to
Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Initial Borrowing Date
or the Amendment/Restatement Effective Date, as applicable, or in the case of a
Lender that is an Assignee of an interest under this Agreement pursuant to
SECTION 3.7 or 12.8 (unless the respective Lender was already a Lender hereunder
immediately prior to such assignment), on the date of such assignment to such
Lender, together with any other certificate or statement of exemption required
under the Code to establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or
withholding of United States federal income tax with respect to any payments to
such Lender, (i) two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to a complete exemption
under an income tax treaty) (or successor forms) certifying to such Lender's
entitlement to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with
respect to payments to be made under this Agreement and under any Note, or (ii)
if the Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Code and does not comply with the requirements of clause (i) above, (x) a
certificate substantially in the form of EXHIBIT 4.7(D) (any such certificate, a
"SECTION 4.7(d)(ii) CERTIFICATE") and (y) two accurate and complete original
signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (Certificate of Foreign
Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding) or Form W-8ECI
(Certificate of Foreign Person's Claim for Exemption From Withholding On Income
Effectively Connected with the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United
States). In addition, each Lender agrees that from time to time after the
delivery of any certificates or forms required pursuant to this SECTION 4.7(d),
when a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders the previous
certification obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, it will deliver to
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two new accurate and complete original
signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN and a
Section 4.7(d)(ii) Certificate, as the case may be, and such other forms as may
be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to a
continued exemption from or reduction in United States withholding Tax with
respect to payments under this Agreement and any Note, or it shall immediately
notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its inability to deliver any
such form or certificate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
SECTION 4.7(a), but subject to SECTION 12.8(c) and the immediately succeeding
sentence, (x) the Borrower shall be entitled, to the extent it is required to do
so by law, to deduct or withhold income or similar Taxes imposed by the United
States (or any political subdivision or


                                       84
<PAGE>

taxing authority thereof or therein) from interest, fees or other amounts
payable hereunder for the account of any Lender which is not a United States
person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for United
States Federal income tax purposes to the extent that such Lender has not
provided to the Borrower IRS Forms that establish a complete exemption from such
deduction or withholding and (y) the Borrower shall be obligated pursuant to
SECTION 4.7(a) hereof to gross-up payments to be made to a Lender in respect of
income or similar Taxes imposed by the United States unless (i) upon timely
notice from the Borrower, such Lender has not provided to the Borrower the IRS
Forms required to be provided to Borrowers pursuant to this SECTION 4.7(d), or
(ii) in the case of a payment, other than interest, to a Lender described in
clause (ii) above, to the extent that such IRS Forms do not establish a complete
exemption from withholding of such Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in the preceding sentence or elsewhere in this SECTION 4.7
and except as set forth in SECTION 12.8(c), the Borrower agrees to pay
additional amounts and to indemnify each Lender in the manner set forth in
SECTION 4.7(a) (without regard to the identity of the jurisdiction requiring the
deduction or withholding) in respect of any amounts deducted or withheld by it
as described in the immediately preceding sentence as a result of any changes
after the Initial Borrowing Date in any applicable law, treaty, governmental
rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in the interpretation thereof, relating
to the deducting or withholding of income or similar Taxes.

                  (e) If the Borrower pays any additional amount under this
SECTION 4.7 to a Lender and such Lender determines in its sole discretion that
it has actually received or realized in connection therewith any refund or any
reduction of, or credit against, its Tax liabilities in or with respect to the
taxable year in which the additional amount is paid (a "TAX BENEFIT"), such
Lender shall pay the Borrower an amount that the Lender shall, in its sole
discretion, determine is equal to the net benefit, after tax, which was obtained
by such Lender in such year as a consequence of such Tax Benefit; provided,
however, that (i) any Lender may determine in its sole discretion consistent
with the policies of such Lender whether to seek a Tax Benefit; (ii) any Taxes
that are imposed on a Lender as a result of a disallowance or reduction
(including through the expiration of any tax carryover or carryback of such
Lender that otherwise would not have expired) of any Tax Benefit with respect to
which such Lender has made a payment to the Borrower pursuant to this SECTION
4.7 shall be treated as a Tax for which the Borrower is obligated to indemnify
such Lender pursuant to this SECTION 4.7 without any exclusions or defenses; and
(iii) nothing in this SECTION 4.7(e) shall require a Lender to disclose any
confidential information to the Borrower (including, without limitation, its tax
returns).

Section 5.1.      CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO ALL CREDIT EVENTS.

The obligation of each Lender to make Loans (including Loans made on the

Lender to participate in any Letter of Credit hereunder in each
case shall be subject to the fulfillment at or prior to the time of each such
Credit Event of each of the following conditions:

                  (a) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations and

made on and as of such time, except to the extent such representations and
warranties are expressly made as of a specified date in which event such
representation and warranties shall be true and correct as of such specified

the Borrower shall be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by it
to the effect of paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this SECTION 5.1 (except
that no opinion need be expressed as to any Agent's or Required Lenders'
satisfaction with any document, instrument or other matter).

                                   ARTICLE VI
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the
Loans, and issue (or participate in) the Letters of Credit as provided herein,
the Borrower makes the following representations and warranties as of the
Amendment/Restatement Effective Date and as of the date of each subsequent
Credit Event, all of which shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Notes and the making of the Loans and issuance of the Letters
of Credit:

Section 6.1.      CORPORATE STATUS.

The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries (i) is a duly organized and validly
existing corporation, partnership or limited liability company or other entity
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (ii)
has the requisite power and authority to own its property and assets and to
transact the business in which it is engaged and presently proposed to engage in
and (iii) is duly qualified and is authorized to do business and is in good
standing (where relevant) in (y) its jurisdiction of organization and (z) in
each other jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of property or
the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except for such failure
to be so qualified which, in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 6.2.      CORPORATE POWER AND AUTHORITY.

The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has the applicable power and authority
to execute, deliver and perform the terms and provisions of each of the
Documents to which it is a party and has taken all necessary corporate action to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of each of such
Documents. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has duly executed and
delivered each of the Documents to which it is a party, and each of such
Documents constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or similar laws generally affecting creditors' rights and by equitable
principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law).

Section 6.3.      NO VIOLATION.

Neither the execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries of the Documents to which it is a party (including, without
limitation, the granting of Liens pursuant to the Security Documents), nor

furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in writing
to any Lender (including, without limitation, all information contained in the

<PAGE>

contemplated herein is, and all other such factual information (taken as a

dated or certified and not incomplete by omitting to state any fact necessary to
make such information (taken as a whole) not misleading in any material respect
at such time in light of the circumstances under which such information was
provided. The financial projections and other pro forma financial information
contained therein are based on good faith estimates and assumptions believed by
such Persons to be reasonable at the time made, it being recognized by the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders that projections as to future events are
not to be viewed as facts or factual information and that actual results during
the period or periods covered thereby may differ from the projected results. As

or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

                  (a) TERM LOAN PROCEEDS. The Borrower shall have utilized the
proceeds of the Term A Loans made under the Original Credit Agreement as
required under SECTION 6.8 of the Original Credit Agreement. All proceeds of the

                  (b) REVOLVING LOAN PROCEEDS. All proceeds of the Revolving

Borrower on the Amendment/Restatement Effective Date.

                  (d) MARGIN REGULATIONS. No part of the proceeds of any Loan
will be used to purchase or carry any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U
of the Board), directly or indirectly, or to extend credit for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying any such margin stock for the purpose of reducing or
retiring any indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase or carry any
margin security or for any other purpose which might cause any of the loans or



                                       91
<PAGE>

extensions of credit under this Agreement to be considered a "purpose credit"

The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed or caused to be
filed all tax returns (the "RETURNS") which are required to be filed, except
where failure to file any of the Returns would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, and have paid or caused to be paid all taxes
shown to be due and payable on the Returns or on any assessments made against
them or any of their respective material properties and all other material
taxes, fees or other charges imposed on them or any of their respective
properties by any Governmental Authority (other than those the amount or
validity of which is contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with
respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the
books of the Borrower or any such Subsidiary, as the case may be), except where
failure to take any such action could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect; and no tax liens have been filed and no claims are
being asserted with respect to any such taxes, fees or other charges (other than
such liens or claims, the amount or validity of which is currently being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which
reserves in conformity with GAAP (or prior to the Amendment/Restatement
Effective Date, applicable accounting practice) have been provided) which could
be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 6.10.     COMPLIANCE WITH ERISA.

                  (a) SCHEDULE 6.10 sets forth each Plan as of the
Amendment/Restatement Effective Date, after giving effect to the Transaction.
Each Plan has been operated and administered in a manner so as not to result in
any material liability of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries for failure to
comply with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code; no Reportable Event
which could reasonably be expected to result in the termination of any Plan has
occurred with respect to a Plan; to the knowledge of the Borrower, no
Multiemployer Plan is insolvent or in reorganization; the aggregate fair market
value of the assets of each Plan equals or exceeds the aggregate present value
of the accrued benefits under such Plan (using the actuarial funding assumptions
then in effect for such Plan); no Plan has an accumulated or waived funding
deficiency, has permitted decreases in its funding standard account or has
applied for an extension of any amortization period within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Code; neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any material liability to or on account of a
Plan pursuant to Section 409, 502(i), 502(l), 515, 4062, 4063, 4064, 4069, 4201
or 4204 of ERISA or Section 4971 or 4975 of the Code; no proceedings have been
instituted to terminate any Plan; using actuarial assumptions and computation
methods consistent with subpart 1 of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA, and its
Subsidiaries and its ERISA Affiliates would not have any material liability to
all Plans which are Multiemployer Plans in the event of a complete withdrawal
therefrom, as of the close of the most recent Fiscal Year of each such Plan


                                       92
<PAGE>

ending prior to the date of any Credit Event; no Lien imposed under the Code or
ERISA on the assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate exists or is likely to arise on account of any Plan; and, except as
disclosed in the annual audited financial statements delivered pursuant to
SECTION 7.1(b) herein, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries do not maintain or
contribute to any employee welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA) which provides benefits to retired employees (other than as required by
Section 601 of ERISA) or any employee pension benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA), the ongoing annual obligations with respect to either of
which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) To the knowledge of the Borrower, (i) each Foreign Pension
Plan has been maintained in substantial compliance with its terms and with the
requirements of any and all applicable laws, statutes, rules, regulations and
orders and has been maintained, where required, in good standing with applicable
regulatory authorities; (ii) all contributions required to be made with respect
to a Foreign Pension Plan have been timely made; (iii) neither the Borrower nor
any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any obligation in connection with the
termination of, or withdrawal from, any Foreign Pension Plan; and (iv) the
present value of the accrued benefit liabilities (whether or not vested) under
each Foreign Pension Plan, determined as of the end of the Borrower's most
recently ended fiscal year on the basis of the actuarial assumptions set forth
in the most recent actuarial report for such plan, did not exceed the aggregate
of (a) the current value of the assets of such Foreign Pension Plan allocable to
such benefit liabilities, and (b) the amount then reserved on the Borrower's
consolidated balance sheet in respect of such liabilities (and such amount
reserved on Borrower's consolidated balance sheet is not likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect).

Section 6.11.     OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY.

The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title or, with
respect to real property, valid fee simple title (or in each case, the relevant
foreign equivalent, if any) to, or a subsisting leasehold interest in, or a
valid contractual agreement or other valid right to use, all such Person's
material real property, and good title (or relevant foreign equivalent) to, a
valid leasehold interest in, or valid contractual rights or other valid right to
(or an agreement for the acquisition of same) use all of such Person's other
material property (but excluding Intellectual Property), and, in each case, none
of such property is subject to any Lien except for Permitted Liens. The items of
real and personal property (but excluding Intellectual Property) owned by,
leased to or used by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries constitute all of
the assets used in the conduct of such Person's business as presently conducted,
and neither this Agreement nor any other Documents, nor any transaction
contemplated under any such agreement, will affect any right, title or interest
of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in and to any of such assets in a
manner that would have or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

Date, no broker's or finder's fees or commissions or any similar fees or
commissions will be payable by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to the incurrence and maintenance of the Obligations, any other
transaction contemplated by the Documents or any services rendered in connection
with such transactions.

Section 6.21.     SECURITY DOCUMENTS.

                  (a) SECURITY AGREEMENT COLLATERAL. The provisions of the
Security Agreements upon execution and delivery thereof are effective to create
in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors a
legal, valid and enforceable security interest in all right, title and interest
of the applicable Credit Party in the Collateral (other than the Collateral
described in the Mortgages) owned by such Credit Party, and the Security
Agreements, together with the


                                       97
<PAGE>

filings of Form UCC-1 (or other similar filing, if any) in all relevant
jurisdictions and delivery of all possessory collateral create a first lien on,
and security interest in (or similar interest in respect of), all right, title
and interest of the Borrower and such Credit Parties in all of the Collateral
described therein, subject to no other Liens other than Permitted Liens. All
such Liens are fully perfected Liens (or similar legal status). The recordation
in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in the United States
Copyright Office of assignments for security made pursuant to the Security
Agreements will be effective, under Federal law, to perfect the security
interest granted to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured
Creditors in the trademarks, patents and copyrights covered by such the Security
Agreements. Each Credit Party has good and marketable title to, or rights in,
all Security Agreement Collateral, free and clear of all Liens except Permitted
Liens.

                  (b) PLEDGED SECURITIES. The security interests created in
favor of the Collateral Agent, as pledgee for the benefit of the Secured
Creditors under the Pledge Agreements, constitute perfected security interests
in the Pledged Securities, if any, subject to no security interests of any other
Person. No filings or recordings are required in order to perfect the security
interests created in the Pledged Securities under the Pledge Agreement other
than with respect to filings required by applicable foreign law and UCC
financing statements with respect to uncertificated Pledged Securities.

                  (c) REAL ESTATE COLLATERAL. The Mortgages create, as security
for the obligations purported to be secured thereby, a valid and enforceable
(and upon the due recording thereof under applicable law) perfected security
interest in and Lien on all of the Mortgaged Property (including, without
limitation, all fixtures and improvements relating to such Mortgaged Property
and affixed or added thereto on or after the Initial Borrowing Date) in favor of
the Collateral Agent (or such other agent or trustee as may be named therein)
for the benefit of the Secured Creditors, superior to and prior to the rights of
all third Persons (except that the security interest created in the Mortgaged
Property may be subject to the Permitted Liens related thereto). SCHEDULE
6.21(c) contains a true and complete list of the street address (or such other
identifying information as is acceptable to the Administrative Agent) for each
parcel of real property owned or leased by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in
the United States, other jurisdiction in which a material plant is located and
the type of interest therein held by the Borrower or such Subsidiary. The
Borrower or a Subsidiary of the Borrower has good and marketable title to all
Mortgaged Property free and clear of all Liens except those described in the
first sentence of this SECTION 6.21(c) or as otherwise may be acceptable to the
Administrative Agent.

Section 6.23.     INTERCOMPANY NOTES.

Upon execution and delivery thereof, the Intercompany Notes constitute legal,
valid and binding obligations of the Persons party thereto (except to the extent
that the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws generally affecting
creditors' rights and by equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in equity or at law)) and are in full force and effect.

Section 6.24.     AEROJET SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.

The Aerojet Settlement Agreement is in full force and effect on the
Amendment/Restatement Effective Date, no party thereto has opted out of the
Aerojet Settlement Agreement, no Governmental Authority party thereto has any
defense to its obligations thereunder or to the terms thereof, and there are no
facts and circumstances known to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that

Settlement Agreement or that would allow any Governmental Authority party to
avoid its obligations thereunder.

Section 7.9.      ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.

                  (a) Materially comply with and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries, tenants and subtenants to materially comply with, all
Environmental Laws and obtain and comply in all material respects with and
maintain, and take reasonable steps to ensure that all tenants and subtenants
obtain and comply in all material respects with and maintain, any and all
Environmental Permits.

                  (b) Take and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to take,
prompt and appropriate action as required by Environmental Laws to fully respond
to any material non-compliance with all Environmental Laws or Environmental
Permits or to any material Release or threat of a material Release of Hazardous
Materials, in each case, in compliance with Environmental Laws, and upon request
from the Administrative Agent, shall regularly report to the Administrative
Agent on such response. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
whenever the Administrative Agent or any Lender has a reasonable basis to
believe that the Borrower is not in material compliance with applicable
Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits or that any property of the Borrower
or its Subsidiaries (whether owned or leased), or any property to which
Hazardous Materials generated by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries have come to
be located ("OFFSITE PROPERTY") has or may become contaminated or subject to an
order or decree such that any non-compliance, contamination or order or decree
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, then, to the
extent the Borrower has the legal right to do so, the Borrower agrees to, at the
Administrative Agent's request and the Borrower's sole expense: (i) cause an
independent environmental engineer reasonably acceptable to the Administrative
Agent to conduct such studies, evaluations, investigations, or tests of the site
where the alleged or actual non-compliance or contamination has occurred and
prepare and deliver to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower a
report(s) reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent setting forth the
results of such studies, evaluations, investigations, or tests, the Borrower's
proposed plan and schedule for responding to any environmental problems
described therein, and the Borrower's estimate of the costs thereof, and (ii)
provide the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower a supplemental
report(s) of such engineer whenever the scope of the environmental problems or
the Borrower's response thereto or the estimated costs thereof, shall materially
change. Notwithstanding the above, the Borrower shall not be obligated (other
than as required by applicable law) to undertake any tests or remediation at any
Offsite Property that (x) is not owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries and (y) where Hazardous Materials generated by persons other than
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries have also come to be located.

                  (c) Defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders, and their respective employees, the Administrative
Agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all Environmental
Claims or any demands, penalties, fines, liabilities, settlements, damages,
costs and expenses of whatever kind or nature known or unknown, contingent or
otherwise, arising out of, or in any way relating to the violation of,
noncompliance


                                      108
<PAGE>

with or liability under, any Environmental Law applicable to the operations of
the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective properties (whether
currently or formerly owned, leased or operated), or any orders, requirements or
demands of Governmental Authorities related thereto, including, without
limitation, attorneys' and consultants' fees, investigation and laboratory fees,
costs arising from any Remedial Actions, court costs and litigation expenses,
except to the extent that any of the foregoing arise out of the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification therefor. The
agreements in this SECTION 7.9(c) shall survive repayment of the Notes and all
other Obligations.

Section 7.10.     USE OF PROCEEDS.

Use all proceeds of the Loans as provided in SECTION 6.8.

Section 7.11.     INTEREST RATE PROTECTION.

Effective Date, enter into and maintain arrangements acceptable to the
Administrative Agent which have the effect of establishing a fixed or maximum
interest rate reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent for an aggregate
notional principal amount of Indebtedness equal to at least $100,000,000 (the
"NOTIONAL AMOUNT") with an initial average life of not less than two (2) years;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Notional Amount may be reduced on a
dollar-for-dollar basis simultaneously with the reduction of the principal
amount outstanding of the Term Loans.

Section 7.12.     ADDITIONAL SECURITY; FURTHER ASSURANCES.

                  (a) AGREEMENT TO GRANT ADDITIONAL SECURITY. Promptly, and in
any event within 30 days after the acquisition by the Borrower or any Material
Subsidiary of assets or real or personal property or leasehold interests of the

other after acquired collateral deemed material by the Administrative Agent or
Required Lenders (the "ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL"), the Borrower will, and will
cause each of its respective Material Subsidiaries to, take all necessary
action, including (i) the filing of appropriate financing statements under the

Secured Creditors pursuant to the Security Agreement a perfected Lien (subject
only to Permitted Liens) in such Collateral pursuant to and to the full extent
required by the Security Documents and this Agreement and (ii) with respect to

against the Mortgaged California Real Estate is released pursuant to SECTION
12.15(b) but thereafter, the Leverage Ratio of the Borrower is equal to or
greater than 2.00 to 1.00, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to
require the Borrower to execute a Mortgage, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to
execute a Mortgage, with respect to the Mortgaged California Real Estate and
take all other necessary action on behalf of the Collateral Agent or the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors, all in accordance
with SECTION 7.12(e). In furtherance of the foregoing, except as otherwise
permitted by SECTION 8.14, the Borrower hereby agrees that in no event shall it,
in any manner or at any time, transfer, modify or otherwise affect, or permit
any Subsidiary of the Borrower to transfer, modify or otherwise affect, the
legal title of the Mortgaged California Property such that the Borrower or any
such Subsidiary shall no longer be the legal titleholder in the Mortgaged
California Real Estate or shall in any other manner be restricted from granting
such Mortgage in favor of the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent for
the benefit of the Secured Creditors.

                  (b) ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS. The Borrower agrees to

having become a Material Domestic Subsidiary.

                  (c) PLEDGE OF NEW SUBSIDIARY STOCK. The Borrower agrees to

each new Material Domestic Subsidiary and any Subsidiary owning the Stock of a
Material Domestic Subsidiary, and (ii) 65% of the Capital Stock of each new
Material Foreign Subsidiary and 65% of the Capital Stock of any Subsidiary
owning the Stock of Material Foreign Subsidiary established, acquired or created
after the Amendment/Restatement Effective Date to the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Secured Creditors pursuant to the Pledge Agreements promptly, and
in any event, within 30 days of the creation or acquisition of such new
Subsidiary.

                  (d) GRANT OF SECURITY BY NEW SUBSIDIARIES. Subject to the
provisions of SECTIONS 7.12(a) and 7.12(c), the Borrower will promptly and, in
any event, within 30 days of the establishment, acquisition or creation of a
Material Subsidiary, cause each Material Domestic Subsidiary and each Material
Foreign Subsidiary (but only to the extent reasonably requested by the
Administrative Agent) established or created in accordance with SECTION 8.7 to
grant to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors a first
priority Lien (subject to Permitted Liens) on all property (tangible and
intangible) of such Material Subsidiary upon terms satisfactory in form and
substance to the Administrative Agent. The Borrower shall cause each Material
Subsidiary, at its own expense, to execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause
the execution, acknowledgment and delivery of, and thereafter register, file or
record in any appropriate governmental office, any document or instrument
reasonably deemed by the Administrative Agent to be necessary or desirable for
the creation and perfection of the foregoing Liens. The Borrower will cause each
of its Material Subsidiaries to take all action requested by

interests required to be granted pursuant to this SECTION 7.12 shall be granted
pursuant to such security documentation satisfactory in form and substance to
the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders and shall constitute valid and
enforceable perfected security interests prior to the rights of all third
Persons and subject to no other Liens except Permitted Liens or, in the case of
Mortgages, Permitted Real Property Encumbrances. The Additional Security
Documents and other instruments related thereto shall be duly recorded or filed
in such manner and in such places and at such times as are required by law to
establish, perfect, preserve and protect the Liens, in favor of the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors, required to be
granted pursuant to the Additional Security Document and, all taxes, fees and
other charges payable in connection therewith shall be paid in full by the
Borrower or its Subsidiaries. At the time of the execution and delivery of the

not within 30 days after such request deliver evidence reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent with respect to any Foreign Subsidiary that is a
Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Borrower that any of (i) a pledge of 662/3% or
more of the total combined voting power of all classes of Capital Stock of such
Foreign Subsidiary entitled to vote, (ii) the entering into by such Foreign
Subsidiary of a guaranty in substantially the form of the Subsidiary Guaranty or
(iii) the entering into by such Foreign Subsidiary of a security agreement in
substantially the form of the Security Agreement, in any case could cause all or
a portion of the earnings of such Foreign Subsidiary to be treated as a deemed
dividend to such Foreign Subsidiary's United States parent or would otherwise
violate applicable law or result in adverse tax consequences to the Borrower or
its Subsidiaries, then in the case of a failure to


                                      111
<PAGE>

deliver the evidence described in clause (i) above, that portion of such Foreign

meaningful change in the calculation of any financial covenants or restrictions

                                      132
<PAGE>

Required Lenders have given the Borrower notice that the same constitutes an

If any of the foregoing Events of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Administrative Agent, at the written direction of the Required Lenders,
shall take one or more of the following actions: (i) by written or oral or
telephonic notice (in the case of oral or telephonic notice confirmed in writing

immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or notice of
any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, (iii)
terminate any Letter of Credit in accordance with its terms, (iv) direct the
Borrower to pay (and the Borrower agrees that upon receipt of such notice, or
upon the occurrence of any Event of Default specified in SECTION 10.1(e) or
SECTION 10.1(f) with respect to the Borrower it will pay) to the Administrative
Agent at the Payment Office such additional amount of cash, to be held as
security by the Administrative Agent, as is equal to the Assigned Dollar Value
of the aggregate Stated Amount of all Letters of Credit issued for the account
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and then outstanding, and (v) enforce, as
the Administrative Agent (to the extent permitted under the applicable Security
Documents), or direct the Collateral Agent to enforce pursuant to the Security
Documents, as the case may be, all of the Liens and security interests created
pursuant to the Security Documents. In cases of any occurrence of any Event of
Default described in SECTION 10.1(e) or SECTION 10.1(f) with respect to the
Borrower, the Loans, together with accrued interest thereon, shall become due
and payable forthwith without the requirement of any such acceleration or
request, and without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind,
all of which are expressly waived by the Borrower, any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding, and other
amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall also become immediately due and
payable all without notice of any kind.

Anything in this SECTION 10.1 to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Required Lenders, rescind and
annul any acceleration of the Loans by written instrument filed with the
Borrower; PROVIDED that at the time such acceleration is so rescinded and
annulled: (A) all past due interest and principal (other than principal due
solely as a result of such acceleration), if any, on the Loans and all other
sums payable under this Agreement and the


                                      133
<PAGE>

other Loan Documents shall have been duly paid, and (B) no other Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing which shall not have been waived
in accordance with the provisions of SECTION 12.1 hereof. Upon any such
rescission and annulment, the Administrative Agent shall return to the Borrower
any cash collateral delivered pursuant to the preceding paragraph.

Section 10.2.     RIGHTS NOT EXCLUSIVE.

The rights provided for in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any other rights, powers, privileges or
remedies provided by law or in equity, or under any other instrument, document
or agreement now existing or hereafter arising.

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

                  In this ARTICLE XI, the Lenders agree among themselves as

Section 11.1.     APPOINTMENT.

The Lenders hereby appoint DBTCA as the Administrative Agent (for purposes of
this ARTICLE XI, the term "Administrative Agent" shall, except for purposes of
SECTION 11.9, include DBTCA in its capacity as the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security Documents) to act as specified herein
and in the other Loan Documents and any Affiliate of DBTCA performing any of the
duties or functions of the Administrative Agent hereunder or any other Loan
Documents. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes and each holder of any Note
by the acceptance of such Note shall be deemed to irrevocably authorize the
Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions
hereof, the other Loan Documents (including, without limitation, to give notices
and take such actions on behalf of the Required Lenders as are consented to in
writing by the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as the case may be) and any
other instruments, documents and agreements referred to herein or therein and to
exercise such powers hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to
the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such other powers
as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent may perform any
of its duties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, by or through its
officers, directors, Administrative Agents employees or affiliates.

Section 11.2.     NATURE OF DUTIES.

The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities except
those expressly set forth in this Agreement. The duties of the Administrative

ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT SHALL NOT HAVE, BY REASON
OF THIS


                                      134
<PAGE>

AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, A FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP TO OR IN RESPECT
OF ANY LENDER. Nothing in any of the Loan Documents, expressed or implied, is
intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the Administrative Agent
any obligations in respect of any of the Loan Documents except as expressly set
forth herein or therein. Each Lender shall make its own independent
investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the Borrower in
connection with the making and the continuance of the Loans hereunder and shall
make its own appraisal of the credit worthiness of the Borrower, and the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility, either initially
or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before
making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter. The Administrative Agent
will promptly notify each Lender at any time that the Required Lenders have
instructed it to act or refrain from acting pursuant to ARTICLE X.

Section 11.3.     EXCULPATION, RIGHTS ETC.

Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, agents,
employees or affiliates shall be liable to any Lender for any action taken or
omitted by them hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, or in
connection herewith or therewith, unless caused by its or their gross negligence
or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any
Lender for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties herein or for
the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability,
collectibility, or sufficiency of any of the Loan Documents or any other
document or the financial condition of the Borrower. The Administrative Agent
shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or
observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or
any of the Loan Documents or any other document or the financial condition of
the Borrower, or the existence or possible existence of any Unmatured Event of
Default or Event of Default unless requested to do so by the Required Lenders.
The Administrative Agent may at any time request instructions from the Lenders
with respect to any actions or approvals (including the failure to act or
approve) which by the terms of any of the Loan Documents, the Administrative
Agent is permitted or required to take or to grant, and if such instructions are
requested, the Administrative Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from
taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be under any
liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from any action or withholding
any approval under any of the Loan Documents until it shall have received such
instructions from the Required Lenders. Without limiting the foregoing, no
Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative
Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting, approving or refraining
from acting or approving under any of the Loan Documents in accordance with the
instructions of the Required Lenders or, to the extent required by SECTION 12.1,
all of the Lenders.

Section 11.4.     RELIANCE.

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected
in relying, upon any notice, writing, resolution notice, statement, certificate,
order or other document or any telephone, telex, teletype or telecopier message
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made
by the proper Person, and, with respect to all matters pertaining herein or to
any of the other Loan Documents and its duties hereunder or thereunder, upon
advice of counsel selected by the Administrative Agent.

Section 11.5.     INDEMNIFICATION.

To the extent the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed and indemnified by the
Borrower, the Lenders will reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent for
and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, claims,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted
against the Administrative Agent, acting pursuant hereto in such capacity, in
any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, in proportion to each Lender's
Aggregate Pro Rata Share of the Total Commitment; PROVIDED, however, that no
Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, claims, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The obligations of the Lenders under this SECTION 11.5 shall
survive the payment in full of the Notes and the termination of this Agreement.

For purposes of this SECTION 11.5, "Aggregate Pro Rata Share" means, when used
with reference to any Lender and any described aggregate or total amount, an
amount equal to the result obtained by multiplying such desired aggregate or
total amount by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the aggregate
principal amount of such Lender's Revolving Loan, Term A Loan and New Term B
Loan and the denominator of which shall be aggregate of all of the Loans
outstanding hereunder.

Section 11.6.     THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.

With respect to its Loans and Commitments (and its Revolver Pro Rata Share, Term
A Pro Rata Share and New Term B Pro Rata Share, as applicable, thereof), the
Administrative Agent shall have and may exercise the same rights and powers
hereunder and is subject to the same obligations and liabilities as and to the
extent set forth herein for any other Lender or holder of Obligations. The terms
"Lenders", "holder of Obligations" or "Required Lenders" or any similar terms
shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include the
Administrative Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender, one of the Required
Lenders or a holder of Obligations. The Administrative Agent may accept deposits
from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind


                                      136
<PAGE>

of banking, trust or other business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
affiliate of the Borrower as if it were not acting as the Administrative Agent
hereunder or under any other Loan Document, including, without limitation, the
acceptance of fees or other consideration for services without having to account
for the same to any of the Lenders.

Section 11.7.     NOTICE OF DEFAULT.

The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of any Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default hereunder
unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the
Borrower referring to this Agreement describing such Event of Default or
Unmatured Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of
default". In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the
Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.

Section 11.8.     HOLDERS OF OBLIGATIONS.

The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Obligation as
reflected on the books and records of the Administrative Agent as the owner
thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of the
assignment or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative
Agent pursuant to SECTION 12.8(c). Any request, authority or consent of any
Person who, at the time of making such request or giving such authority or
consent, is the holder of any Obligation shall be conclusive and binding on any
subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such Obligation or of any
Obligation or Obligations granted in exchange therefor.

Section 11.9.     RESIGNATION BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

                  (a) The Administrative Agent may resign from the performance
of all its functions and duties hereunder at any time by giving fifteen (15)
Business Days' prior written notice to the Borrower and the Lenders. Such
resignation shall take effect upon the acceptance by a successor Administrative
Agent of appointment pursuant to clauses (b) and (c) below or as otherwise
provided below.

                  (b) Upon any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders
shall appoint a successor the Administrative Agent who shall be satisfactory to
the Borrower and shall be an incorporated bank or trust company.

                  (c) If a successor the Administrative Agent shall not have
been so appointed within said fifteen (15) Business Day period, the
Administrative Agent, with the consent of the Borrower, shall then appoint a
successor who shall serve as the Administrative Agent until such time, if any,
as the Required Lenders, with the consent of the Borrower, appoint a successor
the Administrative Agent as provided above.


                                      137
<PAGE>

                  (d) If no successor the Administrative Agent has been
appointed pursuant to clause (b) or (c) by the twentieth (20th) Business Day
after the date such notice of resignation was given by the Administrative Agent,
the Administrative Agent's resignation shall become effective and the Required
Lenders shall thereafter perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent
hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders, with the consent of
the Borrower, appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above.

                                  ARTICLE XII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

Section 12.1.     NO WAIVER; MODIFICATIONS IN WRITING.

                  (a) No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative
Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies provided for
herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies that may be
available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender at law or in equity or
otherwise. Neither this Agreement nor any terms hereof may be amended, modified,
supplemented, waived, discharged, terminated or otherwise changed unless such
amendment, modification, supplement, waiver, discharge, termination or other
change is in writing signed by the Borrower and the Required Lenders, PROVIDED
that no such amendment, modification, supplement waiver, discharge, termination
or other change shall, without the consent of each Lender (other than a
Defaulting Lender) with Obligations directly affected thereby: (i) extend the
final scheduled maturity of any Loan or Note, or extend the stated maturity of
any Letter of Credit beyond the Revolver Termination Date, or reduce the rate or
extend the time of payment of interest or fees thereon, or reduce the principal
amount thereof, (ii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral (except
as expressly provided in the Security Documents) or Subsidiary Guarantor except
as expressly provided in the Security Documents or in a transaction permitted by
SECTION 8.3, (iii) amend, modify or waive any provision of this SECTION 12.1,
(iv) reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required Lenders (it
being understood that, with the consent of the Required Lenders, the definition
of "Required Lenders" shall include lenders with respect to additional revolving
loans or term loans pursuant to this Agreement so long as such additional
revolving loans or term loans are on substantially the same basis as the
extensions of Revolving Loans or Term Loans, as the case may be, are included on
the Amendment/Restatement Effective Date) or (v) consent to the assignment or
transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that no such amendment, modification, supplement,
waiver, discharge, termination or other change shall (1) increase the
Commitments of any Lender over the amount thereof then in effect without the
consent of such Lender, except as otherwise provided in SECTION 2.8 (it being
understood that waivers or modifications of conditions precedent, covenants,
Events of Default or Unmatured Events of Default shall not constitute an
increase of the Commitment of


                                      138
<PAGE>

any Lender, and that an increase in the available portion of any Commitment of
any Lender shall not constitute an increase in the Commitment of such Lender),
(2) without the consent of each affected Facing Agent, amend, modify or waive
any provision of SECTION 2.10 or alter its rights or obligations with respect to
any Letter of Credit, (3) without the consent of the Administrative Agent,
amend, modify or waive any provision of ARTICLE XI as same applies to the
Administrative Agent or any other provisions as same relates to the rights or
obligations of the Administrative Agent, (4) without the consent of the
Administrative Agent, amend, modify or waive any provisions relating to the
rights or obligations of the Administrative Agent under the other Loan
Documents, (5) without the consent of the Majority Lenders of each Facility
which is being allocated a lesser prepayment, repayment or commitment reduction,
alter the required application of any prepayments or repayments (or commitment
reduction), as between the various Facilities pursuant to the first sentence of
SECTION 4.5(a) and the second and third sentence of SECTION 4.5(a) (although the
Required Lenders may waive in whole or in part, any such prepayment, repayment
or commitment reduction so long as the application, as amongst the various
Facilities, of any such prepayment, repayment or commitment reduction which is
still required to be made is not altered), (6) without the consent of the
Majority Lenders of each Facility, amend the definition of Majority Lenders, (7)
without the consent of the Majority Lenders of the Term A Facility, amend the
definition of Term A Pro Rata Share; without the consent of the Majority Lenders
of the New Term B Facility, amend the definition of New Term B Pro Rata Share;
or without the consent of the Majority Lenders of the Revolving Facility, amend
the definition of Revolver Pro Rata Share, (8) without the consent of the
Majority Lenders of the Term A Facility, amend the definition of Scheduled Term
A Repayments; and without the consent of the Majority Lenders of the New Term B
Facility, amend the definition of Scheduled New Term B Repayments or (9) without
the consent of 66 2/3% of the Lenders (other than Defaulting Lenders) amend,
modify or waive any provision of SECTION 9.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
prior to the date specified in clause (ii) of the definition of "SYNDICATED
DATE" set forth in SECTION 1.1, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may,
without the consent of any Lender, agree to change, modify or alter the terms of
the New Term B Facility (including, without limitation, pricing) and (ii) upon
the execution and delivery of all documentation required by the Administrative
Agent to be delivered pursuant to SECTION 2.8 in connection with a Commitment
Increase Amount or the addition of the Incremental Term C Facility, this
Agreement shall be deemed amended without further action by any Lender to
reflect, as applicable, the new Lenders and their new Commitments and any
increase in the Commitment of any existing Lender and the terms of such
Commitment Increase Amount or Incremental Term C Facility.

                  (b) If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver,
discharge or termination to any of the provisions of this Agreement as
contemplated by clauses (i) through (v), inclusive, of the first proviso to the
third sentence of SECTION 12.1(a), the consent of the Required Lenders is
obtained but the consent of one or more of such other Lenders whose consent is
required is not obtained, then the Borrower shall have the right, so long as all
non-consenting Lenders whose individual consent is required are treated as
described in either clause (A) or (B) below, to either (A) replace each such
non-consenting Lender or Lenders (or, at the option of the


                                      139
<PAGE>

Borrower if the respective Lender's consent is required with respect to less
than all Loans, to replace only the respective Loans of the respective
non-consenting Lender which gave rise to the need to obtain such Lender's
individual consent) with one or more Replacement Lenders pursuant to SECTION 3.7
so long as at the time of such replacement, each such Replacement Lender
consents to the proposed amendment, modification, supplement. waiver, discharge,
termination or other change or (B) terminate such non-consenting Lender's
Revolving Commitment, as the case may be, and repay all outstanding Loans of
such Lender which gave rise to the need to obtain such Lender's consent, in
accordance with SECTION 4.L(b) and/or 4.3; PROVIDED that, unless the Revolving
Commitment, as the case may be, terminated and Loans repaid pursuant to the
preceding clause (B) are immediately replaced in full at such time through the
addition of new Lenders or the increase of the Commitments and/or outstanding
Loans of existing Lenders (who in each case must specifically consent thereto),
then in the case of any action pursuant to preceding clause (B) the Required
Lenders (determined before giving effect to the proposed action) shall
specifically consent thereto, PROVIDED, FURTHER, that in any event the Borrower
shall not have the right to replace a Lender, terminate its Revolving Commitment
or repay its Loans solely as a result of the exercise of such Lender's rights
(and the withholding of any required consent by such Lender) contemplated by the
second proviso to the third sentence of SECTION 12.1(a).

Section 12.2.     FURTHER ASSURANCES.

The Borrower agrees to do such further acts and things and to execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent such additional assignments, agreements,
powers and instruments, as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require or
deem advisable to carry into effect the purposes of this Agreement or any of the
Loan Documents or to better assure and confirm unto the Administrative Agent its
rights, powers and remedies hereunder.

Section 12.3.     NOTICES, ETC.

Except where oral or telephonic instructions or notices are authorized herein to
be given, all notices, demands, instructions and other communications required
or permitted to be given to or made upon any party hereto or any other Person
shall be in writing and shall be personally delivered or sent by registered or

above, all in accordance with the provisions of this SECTION 12.3. Unless
otherwise specified in a notice sent or delivered in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of this SECTION 12.3, notices, demands, instructions and
other communications in writing shall be given to or made upon the respective
parties hereto at their respective addresses (or to their respective telecopier
numbers)

Assignment and Assumption Agreement and, in the case of telephonic instructions
or notices, by calling the telephone number or numbers indicated for such party

Agreement, as the case may be.

Section 12.4.     COSTS, EXPENSES AND TAXES; INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a) GENERALLY. The Borrower agrees (without duplication) to
pay all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agents in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, printing, typing, reproduction, execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the documents and instruments
referred to herein and therein and any amendment, waiver, consent relating
hereto or thereto or other modifications of (or supplements to) any of the
foregoing and any and all other documents and instruments furnished pursuant
hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith, including without
limitation, the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of Winston & Strawn,
special counsel to the Administrative Agent and the Syndication Agent, and any
local counsel retained by the Administrative Agent relative thereto or the
reasonable allocated costs of staff counsel as well as the fees and
out-of-pocket expenses of counsel, independent public accountants and other
outside experts retained by the Administrative Agent in connection with the
administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and all search
fees, appraisal fees and expenses, title insurance policy fees, costs and
expenses and filing and recording fees and all costs and expenses (including,
without limitation, Attorney Costs), if any, of the Agents and the Lenders in
connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, any of the Loan Documents or
any other agreement furnished pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection
herewith or therewith. In addition, the Borrower shall pay any and all present
and future stamp, transfer, excise and other similar taxes payable or determined
to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
any Loan Document, or the making of any Loan (other than taxes based on the net
income of the Lenders), and agrees to save and hold the Administrative Agent and
each Lender harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or
resulting from any delay by the Borrower in paying, or omission by the Borrower
to pay, such taxes. Any portion of the foregoing fees, costs and expenses which
remains unpaid more than thirty (30) days following the Administrative Agent's,
any Agents' or any Lender's statement and request for payment thereof shall bear
interest from the date of such statement and request to the date of payment at
the Default Rate. The Borrower will indemnify and hold harmless the
Administrative Agent, each Agent and each Lender and each director, officer,
employee, partner, agent, attorney, trustee and Affiliate of the Administrative
Agent, each Agent and each Lender (each such Person an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from
and against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, obligations (including
removal or remedial actions), expenses or liabilities which arise out of, in any
way relate to, or result from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents and to reimburse each Indemnified Party upon
their demand, for any Attorney Costs incurred in connection with investigating,
preparing to defend or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action
or claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, (a) that no Indemnified Party shall have the


                                      141
<PAGE>

right to be so indemnified hereunder for any loss, claim, damage, penalties,
obligations, expense or liability to the extent it arises or results from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and (b) that nothing contained
herein shall affect the obligations and liabilities of the Lenders to the
Borrower contained herein. If any action, suit or proceeding arising from any of
the foregoing is brought against the Administrative Agent, any Agent, any Lender
or any other Indemnified Party, the Borrower will, if requested by the
Administrative Agent, any Agent, any Lender or any such Indemnified Party,
resist and defend such action, suit or proceeding or cause the same to be
resisted and defended by counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Person or
Persons indemnified or intended to be indemnified. Each Indemnified Party shall,
unless the Administrative Agent, an Agent, a Lender or other Indemnified Party
has made the request described in the preceding sentence and such request has
been complied with, have the right to employ its own counsel (or (but not as
well as) staff counsel) to investigate and control the defense of any matter
covered by such indemnity and the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party. Excluding any liability
arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Indemnified
Party, the Borrower further agrees to indemnify and hold each Indemnified Party
harmless from all loss, cost (including Attorney Costs), liability and damage
whatsoever incurred by any Indemnified Party by reason of any violation of any
Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits or for the Release or threatened
Release of any Contaminants into the environment for which the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries has any liability or which occurs upon the Mortgaged
Property or which is related to any property currently or formerly owned, leased
or operated by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or by
reason of the imposition of any Environmental Lien in respect of the Borrower or
its Subsidiaries or which occurs by a breach of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants relating to environmental matters contained herein,
including, without limitation, by reason of any matters disclosed in SCHEDULE
6.17, PROVIDED that, with respect to any liabilities arising from acts or
failure to act for which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is strictly
liable under any Environmental Law or Environmental Permit, the Borrower's
obligation to each Indemnified Party under this indemnity shall likewise be
without regard to fault on the part of the Borrower or any such Subsidiary. If
the Borrower shall fail to do any act or thing which it has covenanted to do
hereunder or any representation or warranty on the part of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary contained herein or in any other Loan Document shall be breached, the
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) do the same or cause it
to be done or remedy any such breach, and may expend its funds for such purpose,
and will use its best efforts to give prompt written notice to the Borrower that
it proposes to take such action. Any and all amounts so expended by the
Administrative Agent shall be repaid to it by the Borrower promptly upon the
Administrative Agent's demand therefor, with interest at the Default Rate in
effect from time to time during the period including the date so expended by the
Administrative Agent to the date of repayment. To the extent that the
undertaking to indemnify, pay or hold harmless the Administrative Agent or any
Lender as set forth in this SECTION 12.4 may be unenforceable because it is
violative of any law or public policy, the Borrower shall make the maximum
contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the indemnified
liabilities which is permissible under applicable law.


                                      142
<PAGE>

The obligations of the Borrower under this SECTION 12.4 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, the assignment by any Lender of all or any part
of its Credit Exposure hereunder and the discharge of the Borrower's other
Obligations hereunder.

                  (b) FOREIGN EXCHANGE INDEMNITY. If any sum due from the
Borrower under this Agreement or any order or judgment given or made in relation
hereto has to be converted from the currency (the "FIRST CURRENCY") in which the
same is payable hereunder or under such order or judgment into another currency
(the "SECOND CURRENCY") for the purpose of (i) making or filing a claim or proof
against the Borrower with any Governmental Authority or in any court or
tribunal, or (ii) enforcing any order or judgment given or made in relation
hereto, the Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Persons to
whom such sum is due from and against any loss actually suffered as a result of
any discrepancy between (a) the rate of exchange used to convert the amount in
question from the first currency into the second currency, and (b) the rate or
rates of exchange at which such Person, acting in good faith in a commercially
reasonable manner, purchased the first currency with the second currency after
receipt of a sum paid to it in the second currency in satisfaction, in whole or
in part, of any such order, judgment, claim or proof. The foregoing indemnity
shall constitute a separate obligation of the Borrower distinct from its other
obligations hereunder and shall survive the giving or making of any judgment or
order in relation to all or any of such other obligations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, payments of principal and interest on Loans denominated in Euro shall
be made in Euro.

Section 12.5.     CONFIRMATIONS.

Each of the Borrower and each holder of any portion of the Obligations agrees
from time to time, upon written request received by it from the other, to
confirm to the other in writing (with a copy of each such confirmation to the
Administrative Agent) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loan or Loans
and other Obligations then outstanding.

Section 12.6.     ADJUSTMENT; SETOFF.
                  ------------------

                  (a) If any Lender (a "BENEFITED LENDER") shall at any time
receive any payment of all or part of its Loans, or interest thereon, or receive
any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by
setoff, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in SECTION
10.1(e) or SECTION 10.1(f) hereof, or otherwise) in a greater proportion than
any such payment to and collateral received by any other Lender in respect of
such other Lender's Loans or interest thereon, such Benefited Lender shall
purchase for cash from the other Lenders such portion of each such other
Lender's Loans, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any
such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such
Benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or
proceeds ratably with each Lender; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if all or any portion
of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefited
Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the


                                      143
<PAGE>

purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but
without interest unless the Benefited Lender from which such excess payment is
recovered is required by court order to pay interest thereon, in which case each
Lender returning funds to such Benefited Lender shall pay its pro rata share of
such interest. The Borrower agrees that each Lender so purchasing a portion of
another Lender's Loans may exercise all rights of payment (including, without
limitation, rights of setoff) with respect to such portion as fully as if such
Lender were the direct holder of such portion.

                  (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the
Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to setoff and
apply against any Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, of the Borrower to
such Lender, any amount owing from such Lender to the Borrower, at or at any
time after, the happening of any of the above-mentioned events, and the
aforesaid right of setoff may be exercised by such Lender against the Borrower
or against any trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the
benefit of creditors, receivers, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor
of the Borrower, or against anyone else claiming through or against, the
Borrower or such trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the
benefit of creditors, receivers, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor,
notwithstanding the fact that such right of setoff shall not have been exercised
by such Lender prior to the making, filing or issuance, or service upon such
Lender of, or of notice of, any such petition, assignment for the benefit of
creditors, appointment or application for the appointment of a receiver, or
issuance of execution, subpoena, order or warrant. Each Lender agrees promptly
to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and
application made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice
shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

                  (c) The Borrower expressly agrees that to the extent the
Borrower makes a payment or payments and such payment or payments, or any part
thereof, are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or are required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver, or
any other party under any bankruptcy act, state or federal law, common law or
equitable cause, then to the extent of such payment or repayment, the
Indebtedness to the Lenders or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be
revived and continued in full force and effect as if said payment or payments
had not been made.

Section 12.7.     EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS.

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different
parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which counterparts, when so
executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original and all of which
counterparts, taken together, shall constitute but one and the same Agreement.

Section 12.8.     BINDING EFFECT; ASSIGNMENT; ADDITION AND SUBSTITUTION OF
                  LENDERS.

                  (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the
benefit of, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, all future
holders of the Notes and their respective successors and assigns; PROVIDED,
however, that the Borrower may not assign its rights or obligations hereunder or
in connection herewith or any interest herein (voluntarily, by operation of law
or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and
all of the Lenders.

                  (b) Each Lender may at any time sell to one or more banks or
other entities ("PARTICIPANTS") participating interests in all or any portion of
its Commitment and Loans or participation in Letters of Credit or any other
interest of such Lender hereunder (in respect of any Lender, its "CREDIT
EXPOSURE"). In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests
to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance
thereof, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Each Lender shall from time to time upon
request of the Borrower notify the Borrower of the identity of any Participants
with respect to its Credit Exposure hereunder, provided, however, that failure
to provide such notice will not affect the validity of such participation. The
Borrower agrees that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement or any of the
Loan Documents are due or unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have
become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each
Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff in respect of its
participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement and the Loan
Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were
owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such right of setoff shall be subject to the
obligation of such Participant to share with the Lenders, and the Lenders agree
to share with such Participant, as provided in SECTION 12.6. The Borrower also
agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of SECTION 3.5,
3.6 and 4.7 with respect to its participation in the Loans outstanding from time
to time, PROVIDED that such Participant's benefits under SECTIONS 3.5, 3.6 and
4.7 shall be limited to the benefits that the primary Lender would be entitled
to thereunder. Each Lender agrees that any agreement between such Lender and any
such Participant in respect of such participating interest shall not restrict
such Lender's right to approve or agree to any amendment, restatement,
supplement or other modification to, waiver of, or consent under, this Agreement
or any of the Loan Documents except to the extent that any of the foregoing
would (i) extend the final scheduled maturity of any Loan or Note in which such
Participant is participating (it being understood that amending the definitions
of Scheduled Term A Repayments (other than the Term Loan A Maturity Date) and
Scheduled New Term B Repayments (other than the New Term B Loan Maturity Date)
shall not constitute an extension of the final scheduled maturity of any Loan or
Note) or extend the stated maturity of any Letter of Credit in which such
Participant is participating beyond the Revolver Termination Date, or reduce the
rate or extend the time of payment of interest or fees on any such Loan, Note or
Letter


                                      145
<PAGE>

of Credit (except in connection with a waiver of applicability of any
post-default increase in interest rates) or reduce the principal amount thereof,
or increase the amount of the Participant's participation over the amount
thereof then in effect (it being understood that waivers or modifications of
conditions precedent, covenants, Events of Default or Unmatured Events of
Default or of a mandatory reduction in Commitments shall not constitute a change
in the terms of such participation, and that an increase in any Commitment or
Loan shall be permitted without the consent of any Participant if the
Participant's participation is not increased as a result thereof), (ii) consent
to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement or (iii) release all or substantially all of
the Collateral under all of the Security Documents (except as expressly provided
in the Loan Documents) supporting the Loans and/or Letters of Credit hereunder
in which such Participant is participating.

                  (c) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees, including an Affiliate or Related Fund thereof (each an "ASSIGNEE"),
all or any part of its Credit Exposure pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption
Agreement, PROVIDED that (i) it assigns its Credit Exposure in an amount not
less than (A) the Dollar Equivalent of $5,000,000 (or if less the entire amount
of such Lender's Credit Exposure) of the Revolving Facility and/or Term A
Facility or (B) $1,000,000 (or if less the entire amount of such Lenders' Credit
Exposure) of the New Term B Facility (PROVIDED that in the case of
contemporaneous assignments by a Lender to more than one Related Fund, the
minimum amount of $1,000,000 shall be applicable in the aggregate to all such
contemporaneous assignments) and (ii) any assignment of all or any portion of
any Lender's Credit Exposure to an Assignee other than an Affiliate of such
Lender or another Lender, or in the case of a Lender that is a fund any Related
Fund of such Lender, shall require the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent and, in the absence of an Unmatured Event of Default or
Event of Default, the Borrower (the consent of the Borrower not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that for the first twenty
(20) Business Days following the Amendment/Restatement Effective Date,
assignments by the Agents shall not require the consent of the Borrower) and
PROVIDED FURTHER, that notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, any Lender may
at any time assign all or any part of its Credit Exposure to any Affiliate of
such Lender or to any other Lender (treating any Related Fund of such Lender as
a single Lender). Upon execution of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement and
the payment by the parties thereto of a nonrefundable assignment fee of $3,500
in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent at its Payment Office
in connection with each such assignment (PROVIDED, that in the case of
contemporaneous assignments by a Lender to more than one Related Fund, only a
single fee of $3,500 shall be payable for all such contemporaneous assignments),
written notice thereof by such transferor Lender to the Administrative Agent and
the recording by the Administrative Agent in the Register of such assignment and
the resulting effect upon the Loans and/or Revolving Commitment of the assigning
Lender and the Assignee, the Assignee shall have, to the extent of such
assignment, the same rights and benefits as it would have if it were a Lender
hereunder and the holder of the Obligations (PROVIDED that the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to continue to deal solely and directly
with the assignor Lender in connection with the interests so assigned to the
Assignee until written notice of such


                                      146
<PAGE>

assignment, together with payment instructions, addresses and related
information with respect to the Assignee, shall have been given to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent by the assignor Lender and the Assignee) and, if
the Assignee has expressly assumed, for the benefit of the Borrower, some or all
of the transferor Lender's obligations hereunder, such transferor Lender shall
be relieved of its obligations hereunder to the extent of such assignment and
assumption, and except as described above, no further consent or action by the
Borrower, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent shall be required. At the time
of each assignment pursuant to this SECTION 12.8(c) to a Person which is not
already a Lender hereunder and which is not a United States person (as such term
is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for United States Federal income
tax purposes, the respective Assignee shall provide to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent the appropriate IRS Forms (and, if applicable a Section
4.7(d)(ii) Certificate) described in SECTION 4.7(d). Each Assignee shall take
such Credit Exposure subject to the provisions of this Agreement and to any
request made, waiver or consent given or other action taken hereunder, prior to
the receipt by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of written notice of
such transfer, by each previous holder of such Credit Exposure. Such Assignment
and Assumption Agreement shall be deemed to amend this Agreement and SCHEDULE
1.1(a) hereto, to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the
addition of such Assignee as a Lender and the resulting adjustment of all or a
portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Lender under this
Agreement, the Maximum Commitment, the determination of its Term A Pro Rata
Share, New Term B Pro Rata Share, Revolver Pro Rata Share, as the case may be
(in each case, rounded to twelve decimal places), the Loans, any outstanding
Letters of Credit and any new Notes to be issued, at the Borrower's expense, to
such Assignee, and no further consent or action by the Borrower or the Lenders
shall be required to effect such amendments.

                  (d) The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any
Participant or Assignee (or its investment advisor) (each, a "TRANSFEREE") and
any prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender's
possession concerning the Borrower and any Subsidiary of the Borrower which has
been delivered to such Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or
which has been delivered to such Lender by the Borrower in connection with such
Lender's credit evaluation of the Borrower prior to entering into this
Agreement. Any Transferee or any prospective Transferee to whom such financial
information is disclosed shall be required to maintain the confidentiality of
such information pursuant to SECTION 12.14 as if they were parties to this
Agreement.

                  (e) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement, (i) any Lender may at any time pledge or assign all or any portion of
its rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including, without
limitation, the Notes held by it) to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with
Regulation A of the Federal Reserve Board without notice to, or the consent of,
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and (ii) any Lender which is a fund may
pledge all or any portion of its Notes or Loans to its trustee in support of its
obligations to its




                                      147
<PAGE>


trustee without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent. No such pledge or assignment shall release the transferor Lender from its
obligations hereunder.

FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS PROVISION SATISFACTORY TO AGENT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY
SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN

Section 12.14.    CONFIDENTIALITY.

Each of the Lenders severally agrees to keep confidential all non-public
information pertaining to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors in interest which is provided to it by any such parties in
accordance with such Lender's customary procedures for handling confidential
information of this nature and in a prudent fashion, and shall not disclose such
information to any Person except (i) to the extent such information is public
when received by such Lender or becomes public thereafter due to the act or
omission of any party other than a Lender, (ii) to the extent such information
is independently obtained from a source other than the Borrower or its
Subsidiaries and such information from such source is not, to such Lender's
knowledge, subject to an obligation of confidentiality or, if such information
is subject to an obligation of confidentiality, that disclosure of such
information is permitted, (iii) to an Affiliate of such Lender (or its
investment advisor), counsel, auditors, ratings agencies, examiners of any
regulatory authority having or asserting jurisdiction over such Lender,
accountants and other consultants retained by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender, (iv) in connection with any litigation or the enforcement of the rights
of any Lender or the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, (v) to the extent required by any applicable statute, rule or
regulation or court order (including, without limitation, by way of subpoena) or
pursuant to the request of any Governmental Authority having or asserting
jurisdiction over any Lender or the Administrative Agent; provided, however,
that in such event, if the Lender(s) are able to do so, the Lender shall provide
the Borrower with prompt notice of such requested disclosure so that the
Borrower may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, and, in any
event, the Lenders will endeavor in good faith to provide only that portion of
such information which, in the reasonable judgment of the Lender(s), is relevant
and legally required to be provided, (vi) to any direct or indirect contractual
counterparty in swap agreements or such contractual counterparty's professional
advisors (so long as such contractual counterparty and its professional advisors
agree to be bound by the provisions of this SECTION 12.14), or (vii) to the
extent disclosure to other entities is appropriate in connection with any
proposed or actual assignment or grant of a participation by any of the Lenders
of interests in this Agreement and/or any of the other Loan Documents to such
other entities (who will in turn be required to maintain confidentiality as if
they were Lenders parties to this Agreement). In no event shall the
Administrative Agent or any Lender be obligated or required to return any such
information or other materials furnished by the Borrower.

Section 12.15.    CONCERNING THE COLLATERAL AND THE LOAN DOCUMENTS.

                  (a) AUTHORITY. Each Lender authorizes and directs DBTCA to act
as Collateral Agent under the Security Documents and to enter into the Loan
Documents relating to the Collateral (including, without limitation, the
Security Agreements) for the benefit of the Lenders and the other Secured
Creditors. Each Lender agrees that any action taken by the Administrative Agent
or the Required Lenders (or, where required by the express terms hereof, a
different proportion of the Lenders) in accordance with the provisions hereof or
of the other Loan


                                      150
<PAGE>

Documents, and the exercise by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or
the Required Lenders (or, where so required, such different proportion) of the
powers set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all of the
Lenders. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative
Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall have the sole and
exclusive right and authority to (i) act as the disbursing and collecting agent
for the Lenders with respect to all payments and collections arising in
connection herewith and with the Loan Documents relating to the Collateral; (ii)
execute and deliver each Loan Document relating to the Collateral and accept
delivery of each such agreement delivered by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iii) act as Collateral Agent for the Lenders and certain other
Secured Creditors for purposes stated in the Security Documents to the extent
such perfection is required under the Loan Documents, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the
Collateral Agent hereby appoints, authorizes and directs each Lender to act as
collateral sub-agent for the Collateral Agent and the Lenders for purposes of
the perfection of all security interests and Liens with respect to the
Borrower's and its Subsidiaries' respective deposit accounts maintained with,
and cash and Cash Equivalents held by, such Lender; (iv) manage, supervise and
otherwise deal with the Collateral; (v) take such action as is necessary or
desirable to maintain the perfection and priority of the security interests and
liens created or purported to be created by the Loan Documents, and (vi) except
as may be otherwise specifically restricted by the terms hereof or of any other
Loan Document, exercise all remedies given to the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders with respect to the Collateral under the Loan Documents relating
thereto, applicable law or otherwise.

                  (b) RELEASE OF COLLATERAL.

                      (i) The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby direct
the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, to
release, in accordance with the terms hereof, any Lien held by the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, for the
benefit of the Secured Creditors:

                          (A) against all of the Collateral, upon final and
indefeasible payment in full of the Loans and Obligations and termination
hereof;

                          (B) against any part of the Collateral sold or
disposed of by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent such sale
or disposition is permitted hereby (or permitted pursuant to a waiver or consent
of a transaction otherwise prohibited hereby);

                          (C) against any Collateral acquired by the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries after the Amendment/Restatement Effective Date and at
least 70% of the purchase price therefor is within 120 days of the acquisition
thereof financed with Indebtedness secured by a Lien permitted by SECTION
8.1(c);



                                      151
<PAGE>

                          (D) so long as no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent
upon the request of the Borrower, against any part of the Collateral with a fair
market value of less than $5,000,000 in the aggregate during the term of this
Agreement as such fair market value may be certified to the Administrative Agent
and the Collateral Agent by the Borrower in an officer's certificate acceptable
in form and substance to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent;

                          (E) against a part of the Collateral which release
does not require the consent of all of the Lenders as set forth in SECTION
12.1(a)(ii), if such release is consented to by the Required Lenders; and

                          (F) so long as no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, against the Mortgaged California Real Estate upon
the Leverage Ratio, calculated for the Test Period ending on the last day of the
most recently ended Fiscal Quarter, being less than the ratio 2.00 to 1.00.

                     (ii) Each of the Lenders hereby directs the Administrative
Agent to (or to cause the Administrative Agent to) execute and deliver or file
such termination and partial release statements and such other things as are
necessary to release Liens to be released pursuant to this SECTION 12.15
promptly upon the effectiveness of any such release or enter into intercreditor
agreements contemplated or permitted herein.

                 (c) NO OBLIGATION. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the
Collateral Agent shall have any obligation whatsoever to any Lender or to any
other Person to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries or is cared for, protected or insured or has been
encumbered or that the Liens granted to the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent herein or pursuant to the Loan Documents have been properly or
sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are
entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular
manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue
exercising, any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or available to
the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in any of the Loan Documents,
it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act,
omission or event related thereto, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion,
given the Administrative Agent's and the Collateral Agent's own interests in the
Collateral as one of the Lenders and that neither the Administrative Agent nor
the Collateral Agent shall have any duty or liability whatsoever to any Lender,
provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent shall be responsible for their respective grossly negligent
actions or actions constituting intentional misconduct.

Section 12.16.    EFFECTIVENESS.

This Agreement shall become effective on the date on which (i) the Borrower and
each of the


                                      152
<PAGE>

Lenders shall have signed a counterpart of this Agreement (whether the same or
different counterparts) and shall have delivered the same to the Administrative
Agent at the Notice Office (or to the Administrative Agent's counsel as directed
by such counsel) or, in the case of the Lenders, shall have given to the
Administrative Agent telephonic (confirmed in writing), written, telex or
facsimile notice (actually received) at such office or the office of the
Administrative Agent's counsel that the same has been signed and mailed to it
and (ii) all other conditions described in Article V have been satisfied. The
Administrative Agent will give the Borrower and each Lender prompt written
notice of the occurrence of the Amendment/Restatement Effective Date.

Section 12.17.    REGISTRY.

The Borrower hereby designates the Administrative Agent to serve as the
Borrower's agent, solely for purposes of this SECTION 12.17 to maintain a
register (the "REGISTER") on which it will record the Commitments from time to
time of each of the Lenders, the Loans made by each of the Lenders and each
repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans of each Lender.
Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation shall not
affect the Borrower's obligations in respect of such Loans. With respect to any
Lender, the transfer of the Commitments of such Lender and the rights to the
principal of, and interest on, any Loan made pursuant to such Commitments shall
not be effective until such transfer is recorded on the Register maintained by
the Administrative Agent with respect to ownership of such Commitments and Loans
and prior to such recordation all amounts owing to the transferor with respect
to such Commitments and Loans shall remain owing to the transferor. The
registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of any Commitments and
Loans shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register only upon
the acceptance by the Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered
Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to SECTION 12.8(c) and no
Assignment and Assumption Agreement shall be effective until so recorded.
Coincident with the delivery of such an Assignment and Assumption Agreement to
the Administrative Agent for acceptance and registration of assignment or
transfer of all or part of a Loan, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the
assigning or transferor Lender shall surrender the Note evidencing such Loan,
and thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate principal amount then
owing to such assignor or transferor Lender shall be issued to the assigning or
transferor Lender and/or the new Lender. The Borrower agrees to indemnify the
Administrative Agent from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and
liabilities of whatsoever nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or
incurred by the Administrative Agent in performing its duties under this SECTION
12.17; PROVIDED, HOWEVER that the Administrative Agent shall not have the right
to be so indemnified under this SECTION 12.17 for any loss, claim, damage,
penalties, obligations, expense or liability to the extent it arises from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

and willingness of Kindred Healthcare, Inc. ("Kindred") and certain of its
affiliates to continue to meet and/or honor its obligations under its
contractual arrangements with the Company and the Company's subsidiaries,
including without limitation the lease agreements and various agreements (the
"Spin Agreements") entered into by the Company and Kindred at the time of the
Company's spin-off of Kindred on May 1, 1998 (the "1998 Spin Off"), as such
agreements may have been amended and restated in connection with Kindred's
emergence from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001 (the "Kindred Effective Date"), (b)
the ability and willingness of Kindred to continue to meet and/or honor its
obligation to indemnify and defend the Company for all litigation and other
claims relating to the healthcare operations and other assets and liabilities
transferred to Kindred in the 1998 Spin Off, (c) the ability of Kindred and the
Company's other operators to maintain the financial strength and liquidity
necessary to satisfy their respective obligations and duties under the leases
and other agreements with the Company, and their existing credit agreements, (d)
the Company's success in implementing its business strategy, (e) the nature and
extent of future competition, (f) the extent of future healthcare reform and
regulation, including cost containment measures and changes in reimbursement
policies and procedures, (g) increases in the cost of borrowing for the Company,
(h) the ability of the Company's operators to deliver high quality care and to
attract patients, (i) the results of litigation affecting the Company, (j)
changes in general economic conditions and/or economic conditions in the markets
in which the Company may, from time to time, compete, (k) the ability of the
Company to pay down, refinance, restructure, and/or extend its indebtedness as
it becomes due, (l) the movement of interest rates and the resulting impact on
the value of the Company's interest rate swap agreements and the ability of the
Company to satisfy its obligation under one of these agreements to post cash
collateral if required to do so, (m) the ability and willingness of Atria, Inc.
("Atria") to continue to meet and honor its contractual arrangements with the
Company and Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership ("Ventas Realty") entered into in
connection with the Company's spin off of its assisted living operations and
related assets and liabilities to Atria in August 1996, (n) the ability and
willingness of the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT due to
economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations, including without
limitation, the risk that the Company may fail to qualify as a REIT due to its
ownership of Kindred common stock, (o) the outcome of the audit being conducted
by the Internal Revenue Service for the Company's tax years ended December 31,
1997 and 1998, (p) final determination of the Company's taxable net income for
the year ended December 31, 2001, (q) the ability and willingness of the
Company's tenants to renew their leases with the Company upon expiration of the
leases and the Company's ability to relet its properties on the same or better
terms in the event such leases expire and are not renewed by the existing
tenants and (r) the limitations on the ability of the Company to sell, transfer
or otherwise dispose of its common stock in Kindred arising out of the
securities laws and the registration rights agreement the Company entered into
with Kindred and certain of the holders of the Kindred common stock. Many of
such factors are beyond the control of the Company and its management.

Item 1.   Business

General

     Ventas, Inc. ("Ventas" or the "Company") is a Delaware corporation that
elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), for the year ended
December 31, 1999. The Company believes that it has satisfied the requirements
to qualify as a REIT for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001. The Company
intends to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the
year ending December 31, 2002 and subsequent years. It is possible that
economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause the Company to
fail, or elect not, to continue to qualify as a REIT. The Company owns a
geographically diverse portfolio of healthcare related facilities which
consisted of 44 hospitals, 216 nursing facilities and eight personal care
facilities in 36 states as of December 31, 2001. The Company and its
subsidiaries lease these facilities to healthcare operating companies under
"triple-net" or "absolute-net" leases. Kindred Healthcare, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (collectively, "Kindred") lease 210 of the Company's nursing
facilities and all of the Company's hospitals as of December 31, 2001. The
Company conducts substantially all of its business through a wholly owned
operating partnership, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership ("Ventas Realty") and
an indirect, wholly owned limited liability company, Ventas Finance I, LLC
("Ventas Finance"). The Company operates in one segment which consists of owning
and leasing healthcare facilities and leasing or subleasing such facilities to
third parties. See "Note 2--Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's annual report to
stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, which is incorporated
herein by reference (the "Annual Report").

     The Company was incorporated in Kentucky in 1983 as Vencare, Inc. and
commenced operations in 1985. The Company changed its name to Vencor
Incorporated in 1989 and to Vencor, Inc. in 1993. From 1985 through April 30,
1998, the Company was engaged in the business of owning, operating and acquiring
healthcare facilities and companies engaged in providing healthcare services.

     On May 1, 1998, the Company effected the 1998 Spin Off pursuant to which
the Company was separated into two publicly held corporations. A new
corporation, subsequently named Vencor, Inc. (which has since been renamed
Kindred Healthcare, Inc.), was formed to operate the hospital, nursing facility
and ancillary services businesses. Pursuant to the terms of the 1998 Spin Off,
the Company distributed the common stock of Kindred to stockholders of record of
the Company as of April 27, 1998. The Company, through its subsidiaries,
continued to hold title to substantially all of the real property and to lease
such real property to Kindred. At such time, the Company also changed its name
to Ventas, Inc. and refinanced substantially all of its long-term debt. For
financial reporting periods after and including the 1998 Spin Off, the
historical financial statements of the Company for financial reporting periods
prior to the 1998 Spin Off were assumed by Kindred, and the Company is deemed to
have commenced operations on May 1, 1998. In addition, for certain reporting
purposes under this Form 10-K and other filings, the Commission treats the
Company as having commenced operations on May 1, 1998. On September 13, 1999
(the "Petition Date"), Kindred filed for protection under chapter 11 of title 11
of the United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"). Kindred emerged from
proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code on April 20, 2001 (the "Kindred Effective
Date") pursuant to the terms of Kindred's plan of reorganization (the "Kindred
Reorganization Plan"). As a result of the Kindred bankruptcy proceedings, the
Company suspended the implementation of its original business strategy in 1999
and continued such suspension through 2001.

     The Company's current business strategy is preserving and maximizing
stockholders' capital by means that include (a) the reduction of the amount of
the Company's indebtedness and a reduction of the average all-in cost of the
Company's indebtedness and (b) the implementation of a measured and disciplined
diversification and growth program to reduce the Company's dependence on
Kindred. The ability of the Company to pursue certain of these objectives may be
restricted by the terms of the Company's Amended and Restated Credit, Security,
Guaranty and Pledge Agreement dated January 31, 2000 (the "Credit Agreement").

Dependence on Kindred

     The Company leases all of its hospitals and 210 of its nursing facilities
to Kindred under five master lease agreements (the "Master Leases"). For the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, Kindred accounted for
approximately 98.8%, 98.6% (98.4%, net of write-offs) and 98.5% of the Company's
rental revenues, respectively. In addition, the Company owns 1,080,314 shares of
the outstanding common stock of Kindred. See "--Risk Factors--Any significant
decrease in the value of the 1,080,314 shares of Kindred common stock that the
Company owns, as well as the limitations on the Company's ability to sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of such shares of

                                       4

<PAGE>

Kindred common stock, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
ability to reduce its indebtedness and implement its business strategy."

Recent Developments Regarding Kindred

     In order to govern certain of the relationships between the Company and
Kindred after the 1998 Spin Off and to provide mechanisms for an orderly
transition, the Company and Kindred entered into the Spin Agreements at the time
of the 1998 Spin Off. Except as noted below, each written agreement by and among
Kindred and the Company and/or Ventas Realty was assumed by Kindred and certain
of these agreements were simultaneously amended in accordance with the terms of
the Kindred Reorganization Plan.

     The Company and Kindred also entered into certain agreements and
stipulations and orders both prior to and during the pendency of Kindred's
bankruptcy proceedings governing certain aspects of the business relationships
between the Company and Kindred prior to the Kindred Effective Date. These
agreements and stipulations and orders were terminated on the Kindred Effective
Date in accordance with the terms of the Kindred Reorganization Plan.

     Set forth below is a description of the material terms of (a) the Kindred
Reorganization Plan, (b) certain of the Spin Agreements as assumed by Kindred
pursuant to the Kindred Reorganization Plan, including the terms of amendments
or restatements of such Spin Agreements, where applicable, (c) those Spin
Agreements and other agreements terminated under the Kindred Reorganization
Plan, and (d) new agreements entered into between the Company and Kindred in
accordance with the Kindred Reorganization Plan.

Summary of the Kindred Reorganization Plan

     Under the terms of the Kindred Reorganization Plan, the Company, among
other things, (a) retained all rent paid by Kindred through the Kindred
Effective Date, (b) amended and restated its leases with Kindred, (c) received
1,498,500 shares of the common stock of Kindred together with certain
registration rights, (d) entered into new agreements relating to the allocation
of certain tax refunds and liabilities, and (e) settled certain claims of the
United States pertaining to the Company's former healthcare operations.

Master Leases

     Under the Kindred Reorganization Plan, Kindred assumed its five
pre-existing leases with the Company and Ventas Realty (the "Prior Master
Leases"). The Prior Master Leases were then amended and restated into four
agreements styled as amended and restated master leases (collectively, the
"Amended Master Leases").

     In connection with the consummation on December 12, 2001 of a $225 million
LIBOR based floating rate commercial mortgage backed securitization transaction
(the "CMBS Transaction"), Ventas Realty removed 40 skilled nursing facilities
(the "CMBS Properties") from Amended Master Lease No. 1 and placed the CMBS
Properties in a new fifth master lease with Kindred dated December 12, 2001 (the
"CMBS Master Lease"). Simultaneously with the closing of the CMBS Transaction,
Ventas Realty transferred the CMBS Properties and the CMBS Master Lease to
Ventas Finance, the borrower under the CMBS Transaction. The Amended Master
Leases and the CMBS Master Lease are collectively referred to as the "Master
Leases."

     Each Master Lease is a "triple-net lease" or an "absolute-net lease"
pursuant to which Kindred is required to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities,
maintenance and repairs related to the properties. There are several renewal
bundles of properties under each Master Lease, with each bundle containing a
varying number of properties. All properties within a bundle have primary terms
ranging from 10 to 15 years commencing May 1, 1998, plus renewal options
totaling fifteen years.

     Under each Master Lease, the aggregate annual rent is referred to as Base
Rent (as defined in each Master Lease). Base Rent equals the sum of Current Rent
(as defined in each Master Lease) and Accrued Rent (as defined in each Master
Lease). Kindred is obligated to pay the portion of Base Rent that is Current
Rent, and unpaid Accrued Rents, as set forth below. From May 1, 2001 through
April 30, 2004, Base Rent will equal Current Rent. Under the Master Leases, the
initial annual aggregate Base Rent is $180.7 million from May 1, 2001 to April
30, 2002. For the period from May 1, 2002 through April 30, 2004, annual
aggregate Base Rent, payable all in cash, escalates on May 1 of each year at an
annual rate of 3.5% over the Prior Period Base Rent (as defined in the Master
Leases) if certain Kindred revenue parameters are met. Assuming such Kindred
revenue parameters are met, Annual Base Rent under the Master Leases would be
$187.0 million from May 1, 2002 to April 30, 2003 and $193.6 million from May 1,
2003 to April 30, 2004. See "Note 3--Revenues from Leased Properties" and "Note
9--Transactions with Kindred" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
in the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein

                                       5

by reference.

     Each Master Lease provides that beginning May 1, 2004, if Kindred
refinances its senior secured indebtedness entered into in connection with the
Kindred Reorganization Plan or takes other similar action (a "Kindred
Refinancing"), the 3.5% annual escalator will be paid in cash and the Base Rent
shall continue to equal Current Rent. If a Kindred Refinancing has not occurred,
then on May 1, 2004, the annual aggregate Base Rent will be comprised of (a)
Current Rent payable in cash which will escalate annually by an amount equal to
2% of Prior Period Base Rent, and (b) an additional annual non-cash accrued
escalator amount of 1.5% of the Prior Period Base

     Rent which will accrete from year to year including an interest accrual at
LIBOR (as defined in the Master Leases) plus 450 basis points (compounded
annually) to be added to the annual accreted amount (but such interest will not
be added to the aggregate Base Rent in subsequent years). The Unpaid Accrued
Rent will become payable, and all future Base Rent escalators will be payable in
cash, upon the occurrence of a Kindred Refinancing. Under certain circumstances,
the Company's right to receive payment of the Unpaid Accrued Rent is subordinate
to the receipt of payment by the lenders of Kindred's senior secured
indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of a Kindred Refinancing, the annual aggregate
Base Rent payable in cash will thereafter escalate at the annual rate of 3.5%
and there will be no further accrual feature for rents arising after the
occurrence of such events.

     Under the terms of the Master Leases, the Company has a one time right to
reset the rents under the Master Leases (the "Reset Right"), exercisable 5 years
after the Kindred Effective Date on a Master Lease by Master Lease basis, to a
then fair market rental rate, for a total fee of $5.0 million payable on a
pro-rata basis at the time of exercise under the applicable Master Lease. The
Reset Right under the CMBS Master Lease can only be exercised in conjunction
with the exercise of the Reset Right under Master Lease No. 1. The Company
cannot exercise the Reset Right under the CMBS Master Lease without the prior
written consent of the CMBS Lender if, as a result of such reset, the aggregate
rent for the CMBS Properties would decrease. See "--Risk Factors--Because
Kindred is the primary source of the Company's rental revenues, Kindred's
inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under the Master Leases
would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company" and "--Due to the Company's
dependence on Kindred's rental payments as the primary source of its rental
revenues, the Company may be negatively affected by enforcing its rights under

     The Tax Allocation Agreement, entered into at the time of the 1998 Spin Off
and described in more detail below, was assumed by Kindred under the Kindred
Reorganization Plan and then amended and supplemented by the Tax Refund Escrow
Agreement, also described below. The Tax Stipulation, entered into by Kindred
and the Company during the pendency of the Kindred bankruptcy proceedings, was
superseded by the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement.

     The Tax Allocation Agreement provides that Kindred will be liable for, and
will hold the Company harmless from and against, (i) any taxes of Kindred and
its then subsidiaries (the "Kindred Group") for periods after the 1998 Spin Off,
(ii) any taxes of the Company and its then subsidiaries (the "Company Group") or
the Kindred Group for periods prior to the 1998 Spin Off (other than taxes
associated with the Spin Off) with respect to the portion of such taxes
attributable to assets owned by the Kindred Group immediately after completion
of the 1998 Spin Off and (iii) any taxes attributable to the 1998 Spin Off to
the extent that Kindred derives certain tax benefits as a result of the payment
of such taxes. Under the Tax Allocation Agreement, Kindred would be entitled to
any refund or credit in respect of taxes owed or paid by Kindred under (i), (ii)
or (iii) above. Kindred's liability for taxes for purposes of the Tax Allocation
Agreement would be measured by the Company's actual liability for taxes after
applying certain tax benefits otherwise available to the Company other than tax
benefits that the Company in good faith determines would actually offset tax
liabilities of the Company in other taxable years or periods. Any right to a
refund for purposes of the Tax Allocation Agreement would be measured by the
actual refund or credit attributable to the adjustment without regard to
offsetting tax attributes of the Company.

     Under the Tax Allocation Agreement, the Company would be liable for, and
would hold Kindred harmless against, any taxes imposed on the Company Group or
the Kindred Group other than taxes for which the Kindred Group is liable as
described in the above paragraph. The Company would be entitled to any refund or
credit for taxes owed or paid by the Company as described in this paragraph. The
Company's liability for taxes for purposes of the Tax Allocation Agreement would
be measured by the Kindred Group's actual liability for taxes after applying
certain tax benefits otherwise available to the Kindred Group other than tax
benefits that the Kindred Group in good faith determines would actually offset
tax liabilities of the Kindred Group in other taxable years or periods. Any
right to a refund would be measured by the actual refund or credit attributable
to the adjustment without regard to offsetting tax attributes of the Kindred
Group. See "Note 8--Income Taxes" to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in the Annual Report, which is incorporated by reference herein.

                                       6

     Prior to and during the Kindred bankruptcy proceedings, the Company and
Kindred were engaged in disputes regarding the entitlement to federal, state and
local tax refunds for the tax periods prior to and including May 1, 1998 (the
"Subject Periods") which had been received or which would be received by either
company. Under the terms of the Tax Stipulation, the companies agreed that the
proceeds of certain federal, state and local tax refunds for these Subject
Periods, received by either company on or after September 13, 1999, with
interest thereon from the date of deposit at the lesser of the actual interest
earned and 3% per annum, were to be held by the recipient of such refunds in
segregated interest bearing accounts.

     On the Kindred Effective Date, Kindred and the Company entered into the Tax
Refund Escrow Agreement governing their relative entitlement to certain tax
refunds for the Subject Periods that each received or may receive in the future.
The Tax Refund Escrow Agreement amends and supplements the Tax Allocation
Agreement and supersedes the Tax Stipulation. Under the terms of the Tax Refund
Escrow Agreement, refunds ("Subject Refunds") received on or after September 13,
1999 by either Kindred or the Company with respect to federal, state or local
income, gross receipts, windfall profits, transfer, duty, value-added, property,
franchise, license, excise, sales and use, capital, employment, withholding,
payroll, occupational or similar business taxes (including interest, penalties
and additions to tax, but excluding certain refunds), for taxable periods ending
on or prior to May 1, 1998, or including May 1, 1998 and received on or after
September 13, 1999 ("Subject Taxes") must be deposited into an escrow account
with a third-party escrow agent.

     The Tax Refund Escrow Agreement provides, inter alia, that each party must
notify the other of any asserted Subject Tax liability of which it becomes
aware, that either party may request that asserted liabilities for Subject Taxes
be contested, that neither party may settle such a contest without the consent
of the other, that each party has the right to participate in any such contest,
and that the parties generally must cooperate with regard to Subject Taxes and
Subject Refunds and will mutually and jointly control any audit or review
process related thereto.

     The funds in the escrow account (the "Escrow Funds") may be released from
the escrow account to pay Subject Taxes and as otherwise provided therein.

     The Tax Refund Escrow Agreement provides generally that Kindred and the
Company waive their rights under the Tax Allocation Agreement to make claims
against each other with respect to Subject Taxes satisfied by the Escrow Funds,
notwithstanding the indemnification provisions of the Tax Allocation Agreement.
To the extent that the Escrow Funds are insufficient to satisfy all liabilities
for Subject Taxes that are finally determined to be due (such excess amount,
"Excess Taxes"), the relative liability of Kindred and the Company to pay such
Excess Taxes shall be determined as provided in the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement.
Disputes under the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement, and the determination of the
relative liability of Kindred and the Company to pay Excess Taxes, if any, are
governed by the arbitration provision of the Tax Allocation Agreement.

     Interest earned on the Escrow Funds or included in refund amounts received
from governmental authorities will be distributed equally to each of Kindred and
the Company on an annual basis and are accrued as interest income on the
Consolidated Statement of Operations. Any Escrow Funds remaining in the escrow
account after no further claims may be made by governmental authorities with
respect to Subject Taxes or Subject Refunds (because of the expiration of
statutes of limitation or otherwise) will be distributed equally to Kindred and
the Company.

Agreement of Indemnity--Third Party Leases

     In connection with the 1998 Spin Off, the Company assigned its former third
party lease obligations (i.e., leases under which an unrelated third party is
the landlord) as a tenant or as a guarantor of tenant obligations to Kindred
(the "Third Party Leases"). Under the Kindred Reorganization Plan, Kindred
assumed and has agreed to fulfill its obligations under the Agreement of
Indemnity--Third Party Leases. There can be no assurance that Kindred will have
sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its
obligations under the Agreement of Indemnity--Third Party Leases or that Kindred
will continue to honor its obligations under the Agreement of Indemnity--Third
Party Leases. If Kindred does not satisfy or otherwise honor the obligations
under the Agreement of Indemnity--Third Party Leases, then the Company may be
liable for the payment and performance of such obligations. Under the Kindred
Reorganization Plan, Kindred has agreed not to renew or extend any Third Party
Lease unless it first obtains a release of the Company from liability under such
Third Party Lease. See "--Risk Factors--Kindred may not perform the obligations
it assumed in the 1998 Spin Off relating to indemnification of the Company and
the assumption of the defense of certain claims" and "Note 9--Transactions with
Kindred--Agreement of Indemnity--Third Party Leases" to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in the Annual Report, which is incorporated by
reference herein.

Agreement of Indemnity--Third Party Contracts

                                       7

<PAGE>

     In connection with the 1998 Spin Off, the Company assigned its former third
party guaranty agreements to Kindred (the "Third Party Guarantees"). Under the
Kindred Reorganization Plan, Kindred assumed and has agreed to fulfill its
obligations under the Agreement of Indemnity--Third Party Contracts. There can
be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to
financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations incurred in connection with
the Agreement of Indemnity--Third Party Contracts or that Kindred will continue
to honor its obligations under the Agreement of Indemnity--Third Party
Contracts. If Kindred does not satisfy or otherwise honor the obligations under
the Agreement of Indemnity--Third Party Contracts, then the Company may be
liable for the payment and performance of such obligations. See "--Risk
Factors---Kindred may not perform the obligations it assumed in the 1998 Spin
Off relating to indemnification of the Company and the assumption of the defense
of certain claims." and "Note 9--Transactions with Kindred--Agreement of
Indemnity--Third Party Contracts" to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in the Annual Report, which is incorporated by reference herein.

Assumption of Certain Operating Liabilities and Litigation

     In connection with the 1998 Spin Off, Kindred agreed in various Spin
Agreements to assume and to indemnify the Company for any and all liabilities
that may arise out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations
either before or after the date of the 1998 Spin Off. Under the Kindred
Reorganization Plan, Kindred assumed and agreed to perform its obligations under
these indemnifications. There can be no assurance that Kindred will have
sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its
obligations incurred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off or that Kindred will
continue to honor its obligations incurred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off.
If Kindred does not satisfy or otherwise honor the obligations under these
arrangements, then the Company may be liable for the payment and performance of
such obligations and may have to assume the defense of such claims. See "--Risk
Factors---Kindred may not perform the obligations it assumed in the 1998 Spin
Off relating to indemnification of the Company and the assumption of the defense
of certain claims." and "Note 9--Transactions with Kindred--Assumption of
Certain Operating Liabilities and Litigation" to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in the Annual Report, which is incorporated by reference
herein.

Kindred Common Stock and Registration Rights Agreement

     On the Kindred Effective Date, Ventas Realty received 1,498,500 shares of
the common stock in Kindred, representing not more than 9.99% of the issued and
outstanding common stock in Kindred as of the Kindred Effective Date. Based on
applicable laws, regulations, advice from experts, an appraisal, the trading
performance of the Kindred common stock at the applicable time and other
appropriate facts and circumstances, including the illiquidity and lack of
registration of the Kindred common stock when received and the Company's lack of
significant influence over Kindred, the Company determined that the value of the
Kindred common stock was $18.2 million on the date received by Ventas Realty.
The Kindred common stock received by Ventas Realty is subject to dilution from
stock issuances occurring after the Kindred Effective Date. The Kindred common
stock was issued to Ventas Realty as additional future rent in consideration of
the agreement to charge the base rent as provided in the Master Leases.

     On the Kindred Effective Date, Kindred executed and delivered to Ventas
Realty and other signatories, a Registration Rights Agreement, which, among
other things, provides that Kindred must file a shelf registration statement
with respect to the Kindred common stock and to keep such registration statement
continuously effective for a period of two years with respect to such securities
(subject to customary exceptions). The shelf registration statement was declared
effective on November 7, 2001.

     The Company disposed of 418,186 shares of Kindred common stock in the
fourth quarter of 2001 and recognized a gain of $15.4 million on the
dispositions. In connection with a registered offering of common stock by
Kindred, Ventas Realty exercised its piggyback registration rights, and sold
83,300 shares of Kindred common stock, recognizing a gain of $2.6 million. The
Company applied the net proceeds of $3.6 million from the sale of the 83,300
shares of Kindred common stock as a prepayment on the Company's indebtedness
under the Credit Agreement. The Company declared a distribution of 334,886
shares of Kindred common stock as part of the 2001 dividend, resulting in a gain
of $12.8 million. For every share of common stock of the Company that a
stockholder owned at the close of business on December 14, 2001, the stockholder
received 0.005 of a share of Kindred common stock and $0.0049 in cash (equating
to one share of Kindred common stock and $0.98 in cash for every two hundred
shares of common stock in the Company). For purposes of the 2001 dividend, the
Kindred common stock was valued in accordance with the Code and applicable
rulings and regulations on December 31, 2001 at $51.02 per share. See "--Risk
Factors--Any significant decrease in the value of the 1,080,314 shares of
Kindred common stock that the Company owns, as well as the limitations on the
Company's ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of such shares of
Kindred common stock, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
ability to reduce its indebtedness and implement its business strategy."

Terminated Agreements

     The Participation Agreement and the Development Agreement, both executed in
connection with the 1998 Spin Off, were terminated on the Kindred Effective
Date. The Second Standstill Agreement and the Tolling Agreement, both entered
into by the Company and Kindred in April 1999, and the Tax Stipulation and the
Rent Stipulation were all terminated on the Kindred Effective Date and are of no
further force or effect.

Settlement of United States Claims

     Kindred and the Company were the subject of investigations by the United
States Department of Justice regarding the Company's prior healthcare
operations, including matters arising from lawsuits filed under the qui tam, or
whistleblower, provision of the Federal Civil False Claims Act, which allows
private citizens to bring a suit in the name of the United States. See "Note
12--Litigation" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual
Report, which is incorporated by reference herein. The Kindred Reorganization
Plan contains a comprehensive settlement of all of these claims by the United
States (the "United States Settlement").

     Under the United States Settlement, the Company will pay $103.6 million to
the United States, of which $34.0 million was paid on the Kindred Effective
Date. The balance of $69.6 million bears interest at 6% per annum and is payable
in equal quarterly installments over a five-year term commencing on June 30,
2001 and ending in 2006. The Company made the first three quarterly installments
under the United States Settlement through December 31, 2001.

     The Company also paid approximately $0.4 million to legal counsel for the
relators in the qui tam actions. In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company
recorded the full amount of the obligation under the United States Settlement
for $96.5 million based on an imputed interest rate of 10.75%.

(1)  Based on percentage of rent earned by the Company for the year ended
     December 31, 2001.

(2)  The Company has properties located in 36 states operated by four different
     operators.

Hospital Facilities

     The Company's hospitals generally are long-term acute care hospitals that
serve medically complex, chronically ill patients. The operator of these
hospitals has the capability to treat patients who suffer from multiple systemic
failures or conditions such as neurological disorders, head injuries, brain stem
and spinal cord trauma, cerebral vascular accidents, chemical brain injuries,
central nervous system disorders, developmental anomalies and cardiopulmonary
disorders. Chronic patients are often dependent on technology for continued life
support, such as mechanical ventilators, total parenteral nutrition, respiration
or cardiac monitors and dialysis machines. While these patients suffer from
conditions which require a high level of monitoring and specialized care, they
may not necessitate the continued services of an intensive care unit. Due to
their severe medical conditions, these patients generally are not clinically
appropriate for admission to a nursing facility or rehabilitation hospital.

                                       9

<PAGE>

Nursing Facilities

     The Company's nursing facilities generally are skilled nursing facilities.
In addition to the customary services provided by skilled nursing facilities,
the operators of the Company's nursing facilities typically provide
rehabilitation services, including physical, occupational and speech therapies.

Personal Care Facilities

     The Company's personal care facilities serve persons with acquired or
traumatic brain injury. The operator of the personal care facilities provides
services including supported living services, neurorehabilitation,
neurobehavioral management and vocational programs.

Competition

     The Company competes for real property investments with healthcare
providers, other healthcare related REITs, real estate partnerships, banks,
insurance companies and other investors. Many of the Company's competitors are
significantly larger and have greater financial resources and lower cost of
capital than the Company. The Company's ability to compete successfully for real
property investments will be determined by numerous factors, including the
ability of the Company to identify suitable acquisition targets, the ability of
the Company to negotiate acceptable terms for any such acquisition, the
availability and cost of capital to the Company, and the restrictions contained
in the Credit Agreement. "--Risk Factors--The Company may encounter certain
risks and financing constraints when implementing the Company's business
strategy" and "Note 5--Borrowing Arrangements" to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in the Annual Report, which is incorporated by reference
herein.

     The operators of the Company's properties compete on a local and regional
basis with other healthcare operators. The ability of the Company's operators to
compete successfully for patients at the Company's facilities depends upon
several factors, including the quality of care at the facility, the operational
reputation of the operator, physician referral patterns, physical appearance of
the facilities, other competitive systems of healthcare delivery within the
community, population and demographics, and the financial condition of the
operator. Private, federal and state reimbursement programs and the effect of
other laws and regulations also may have a significant effect on the Company's
operators to compete successfully for patients for the properties.

Environmental Regulation

     Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property from which
there is a release or threatened release of hazardous or toxic substances or an
entity that arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic
substances at a disposal site may be held jointly and severally liable for the
cost of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances that
could be located on, in or under such property or other affected property. Such
laws and regulations often impose liability whether or not the owner, operator
or otherwise responsible party knew of, or caused the presence of the hazardous
or toxic substances. The costs of any required remediation or removal of these
substances could be substantial, and the liability of a responsible party as to
any property is generally not limited under such laws and regulations and could
exceed the property's value and the aggregate assets of the liable party. The
presence of these substances or failure to remediate such substances properly
also may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or rent the property, or
to borrow using the property as collateral. In connection with the ownership and
leasing of the Company's properties, the Company could be liable for these costs
as well as certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to
person or properties or natural resources. In addition, owners and operators of
real property are liable for the costs of complying with environmental, health,
and safety laws, ordinances and regulations and can be subjected to penalties
for failure to comply. Such ongoing compliance costs and penalties for
non-compliance can be substantial. Changes to existing or the adoption of new
environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances, and regulations could
substantially increase an owner's or operator's environmental, health, and
safety compliance costs and/or associated liabilities. Environmental, health,
and safety laws, ordinances, and regulations potentially affecting the Company
address a wide variety of topics, including, but not limited to, asbestos,
polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs"), fuel oil management, wastewater discharges,
air emissions, radioactive materials, medical wastes, and hazardous wastes.
Under the Master Leases, Kindred has agreed to indemnify the Company against any
environmental claims (including penalties and clean-up costs) resulting from any
condition arising in, on or under, or relating to, the leased properties at any
time on or after the commencement date of the lease term for the applicable
leased property. Kindred also has agreed to indemnify the Company against any
environmental claim (including penalties and clean up costs) resulting from any
condition permitted to deteriorate, on or after the commencement date of the
lease term for the applicable leased property (including as a result of
migration from adjacent properties not owned or operated by the Company or any
of its affiliates other than

                                       10

<PAGE>

Kindred and its direct affiliates). There can be no assurance that Kindred will
have the financial capability or the willingness to satisfy any such
environmental claims. See "--Risk Factors--Kindred may not perform the
obligations it assumed in the 1998 Spin Off relating to indemnification of the
Company and the assumption of the defense of certain claims." If Kindred is
unable or unwilling to satisfy such claims, the Company may be required to
satisfy the claims. The Company has agreed to indemnify Kindred against any
environmental claims (including penalties and clean-up costs) resulting from any
condition arising on or under, or relating to, the leased properties at any time
before the commencement date of the lease term for the applicable leased
property.

     The Company did not make any material capital expenditures in connection
with such environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances, and regulations in
2001 and does not expect that it will have to make any such material capital
expenditures during 2002.

Governmental Regulation

General

     The operators of the Company's properties derive a substantial portion of
their revenues from third party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and
medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, certain disabled persons
and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a medical assistance
program jointly funded by federal and state governments and administered by each
state pursuant to which benefits are available to certain indigent patients. The
Medicare and Medicaid statutory framework is subject to administrative rulings,
interpretations and discretion that may affect the amount and timing of
reimbursements made under Medicare and Medicaid. The amounts of program payments
received by the Company's operators and tenants can be changed by legislative or
regulatory actions and by determinations by agents for the programs.

     The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (the "Budget Act") was intended to reduce
the increase in Medicare payments by $115 billion and reduce the increase in
Medicaid payments by $13 billion between 1998 through 2002 and made extensive
changes to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The impact of these changes and
reductions has been only partially ameliorated by subsequent legislation. See
"--Healthcare Reform" below. In addition, private payors, including managed care
payors, increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures and the assumption
by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk. Efforts to
impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon operators by
private payors are expected to continue. Further, on March 25, 1999, legislation
was passed that prevents nursing facility operators that decide to withdraw from
the Medicaid program from evicting or transferring patients who are residents as
of the effective date of withdrawal, and who rely on Medicaid to cover their
long-term care expenses. There can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement
levels will continue to be available for services to be provided by the
operators of the Company's properties, which currently are being reimbursed by
Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of
services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material
adverse effect on these operators' liquidity, financial condition and results of
operations, which could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments
to the Company.

     The operators of the Company's properties are subject to extensive federal,
state and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to, laws and
regulations relating to licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of
facilities, addition of facilities, services, prices for services and billing
for services. These laws authorize periodic inspections and investigations, and
identification of deficiencies that, if not corrected, can result in sanctions
that include loss of licensure to operate and loss of rights to participate in
the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Regulatory agencies have substantial powers
to affect the actions of operators of the Company's properties if the agencies
believe that there is an imminent threat to patient welfare, and in some states
these powers can include assumption of interim control over facilities through
receiverships. Extensive legislation and regulations also pertain to healthcare
fraud and abuse, including kickbacks, physician self-referrals and false claims.

     Federal anti-kickback laws codified under Section 1128B(b) of the Social
Security Act (the "Anti-kickback Laws") prohibit certain business practices and
relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services
reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs,
including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients
whose care will be paid by Medicare or other governmental programs. Sanctions
for violating the Anti-kickback Laws include criminal penalties and civil
sanctions, including fines and possible exclusion from government programs such
as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In the ordinary course of its business,
the operators of the Company's properties have been and are subject regularly to
inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee
these laws and regulations.

     Pursuant to the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of
1987, the Department of Health

                                       11

<PAGE>

and Human Services ("HHS") periodically has issued regulations that describe
some of the conduct and business relationships permissible under the
Anti-kickback Laws ("Safe Harbors"). The fact that a given business arrangement
does not fall within a Safe Harbor does not render the arrangement per se
illegal. Business arrangements of healthcare service providers that fail to
satisfy the applicable Safe Harbor's criteria, however, risk increased scrutiny
and possible sanctions by enforcement authorities.

     The operators of the Company's properties also are subject to the Ethics in
Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the Stark Law. In the
absence of an applicable exception, the Stark Law prohibits referrals by
physicians of Medicare and other government-program patients to providers of a
broad range of designated health services with which the physicians (or their
immediate family members) have ownership interests or certain other financial
arrangements. Initially, the Stark Law applied only to clinical laboratory
services and regulations applicable to clinical laboratory services were issued
in 1995. Earlier that same year, the Stark Law's self-referral prohibition
expanded to additional goods and services, including inpatient and outpatient
hospital services. In January 2001 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services ("CMS," formerly the Health Care Financing Administration) published a
final rule that it characterized as the first phase of what will be a two-phase
final rule, and most of the provisions of part one of this final rule became
effective on January 4, 2002. Although CMS has stated that it intends to publish
phase two shortly, it is unclear when this will occur.

     Many states have adopted or are considering legislative proposals similar
to the federal referral prohibition, some of which extend beyond the Medicare
and Medicaid programs to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the
referral of patients and physician self-referrals regardless of whether the
service was reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid. These laws and regulations are
extremely complex, and little judicial or regulatory interpretation exists. A
violation of such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on
these operators' liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which
could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments to the Company.

     Government investigations and enforcement of healthcare laws has increased
dramatically over the past several years and is expected to continue. The Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-191)
("HIPAA"), which became effective January 1, 1997, greatly expanded the
definition of healthcare fraud and related offenses and broadened the scope to
include private healthcare plans in addition to government payors. HIPAA also
greatly increased funding for the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Office of the Inspector General to audit, investigate and
prosecute suspected healthcare fraud. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud
also has increased due in large part to amendments to the civil False Claims Act
in 1986 that were designed to encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of
the government. These whistleblower suits by private individuals, known as qui
tam relators, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former
patients and nurses and other employees. HIPAA also mandates the adoption by HHS
of regulations aimed at standardizing transaction formats and billing codes for
documenting medical services, dealing with claims submissions and protecting the
privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA
regulations that standardize transactions and code sets became final in the
fourth quarter of 2000. Final privacy regulations became effective in April
2001, with compliance required by April 2003. HIPAA's security regulations have
not yet been finalized. These actions could have a material adverse effect on
these operators' liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which
could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments to the Company.

     The Budget Act also provides a number of additional anti-fraud and abuse
provisions. The Budget Act contains new civil monetary penalties for an
operator's violation of the Anti-kickback Laws and imposes an affirmative duty
on operators to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded
from the Medicare and other government programs. The Budget Act also provides a
minimum ten-year period for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare
programs for operators convicted of a prior healthcare offense.

     Some states require state approval for development and expansion of
healthcare facilities and services, including findings of need for additional or
expanded healthcare facilities or services. A certificate of need ("CON"), which
is issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities,
is at times required for expansion of existing facilities, construction of new
facilities, addition of beds, acquisition of major items of equipment or
introduction of new services. The CON rules and regulations may restrict an
operator's ability to expand the Company's properties in certain circumstances.

     In the event that any operator of the Company's properties fails to make
rental payments to the Company or to comply with the applicable healthcare
regulations, and, in either case, such operators or their lenders fail to cure
the default prior to the expiration of the applicable cure period, the ability
of the Company to evict that operator and substitute another operator or
operators may be materially delayed or limited by various state licensing,
receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by Medicare and Medicaid
change-of-ownership rules. Such delays and limitations could have a material
adverse effect on the Company's ability to collect rent, to obtain possession of
leased

                                       12

<PAGE>

properties, or otherwise to exercise remedies for tenant default. In addition,
the Company may also incur substantial additional expenses in connection with
any such licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings.

Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals

     Substantially all of the Company's hospitals are operated as long-term
acute care hospitals ("LTACs"). In order to receive Medicare and Medicaid
reimbursement, each hospital must meet the applicable conditions of
participation set forth by HHS relating to the type of hospital, its equipment,
personnel and standard of medical care, as well as comply with state and local
laws and regulations. Hospitals undergo periodic on-site certification surveys,
which generally are limited if the hospital is accredited by the Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations ("JCAHO") or other
recognized accreditation organizations. A loss of certification could adversely
affect a hospital's ability to receive payments from Medicare and Medicaid
programs, which could in turn adversely impact the operator's ability to make
rental payments under its leases with the Company.

     An LTAC has an average length of stay greater than 25 days. Hospitals that
are certified by Medicare as LTACs are currently excluded from the prospective
payment system ("PPS") that applies to acute care hospitals. However, a PPS
system for LTACs is scheduled to be in place by October 1, 2002 and applicable
to cost report periods commencing on or after October 1, 2002. See "--Healthcare
Reform" below. Inpatient operating costs for LTACs are reimbursed under a
cost-based reimbursement system, subject to a computed target rate per discharge
for inpatient operating costs established by the Tax Equity and Fiscal
Responsibility Act of 1982 ("TEFRA"), as amended by the Budget Act and the
Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000
("BIPA"). Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements generally are determined from
annual cost reports filed by hospital operators that are subject to audit by the
respective agency (or their fiscal agents) administering the program. Under such
programs of cost-based reimbursement, costs which will be accepted for
reimbursement are defined and limited by statutes, regulations and program
policies relating to numerous factors, including necessity, reasonableness,
related-party principles and relatedness to patient care.

Nursing Facilities

     The operators of the Company's nursing facilities generally are licensed on
an annual or bi-annual basis and certified annually for participation in the
Medicare and Medicaid programs through various regulatory agencies which
determine compliance with federal, state and local laws. These legal
requirements relate to the quality of the nursing care provided, qualifications
of the administrative personnel and nursing staff, the adequacy of the physical
plant and equipment and continuing compliance with the laws and regulations
governing the operation of nursing facilities.

     The Budget Act established a prospective payment system for Medicare
skilled nursing facilities ("SNFs") for cost reporting periods beginning on or
after July 1, 1998. The payments received under the SNF prospective payment
system cover all services for Medicare patients, including ancillary services.
The rates for such services were first published in the Federal Register on May
12, 1998, after the consummation of the 1998 Spin Off. Although there has been
some payment relief under the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999
("Refinement Act") and BIPA, there can be no assurance that the reimbursement
levels under the SNF prospective payment system will be sufficient to permit the
Company's operators to satisfy their obligations, including payment of rent
under their leases with the Company. See "--Healthcare Reform."

Healthcare Reform

     Healthcare is one of the largest industries in the United States and
continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention. In an
effort to reduce federal spending on healthcare, in 1997 the Federal government
enacted the Budget Act, which contained extensive changes to the Medicare and
Medicaid programs intended to reduce the projected amount of increase in
payments under those programs by $115 billion and $13 billion, respectively,
between 1998 and 2002. Under the Budget Act, annual growth rates for Medicare
were to be reduced from over 10% to approximately 7.5% for the period between
1998 and 2002 based on specific program baseline projections from 1993 to 1997.
Virtually all spending reductions have and will come from healthcare operators
and changes in program components. For certain healthcare providers, including
hospitals, home health agencies, SNFs and hospices, implementation of the Budget
Act resulted in more drastic reimbursement reductions than had been anticipated.
In addition to its impact on Medicare, the Budget Act also afforded states more
flexibility in administering their Medicaid plans, including the ability to
shift most Medicaid enrollees into managed care plans without first obtaining a
federal waiver. Accordingly, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including
payment levels and methods, are in a state of change and are less predictable
than before enactment of the Budget Act. Further Medicare reform legislation is
currently under consideration by Congress. See "Recent Developments Regarding
Government Regulations."

                                       13

     The Budget Act established a prospective payment system for skilled nursing
facilities ("SNF PPS") to be transitioned over a three-year period for cost
reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1998. Under the SNF PPS payment
methodology, payment amounts are based upon classifications determined through
assessments of individual Medicare patients in the skilled nursing facility,
rather than on the facility's reasonable costs. The SNF PPS features a case-mix
adjustment that utilizes data derived from a standardized clinical assessment
tool that assesses a patient's needs known as the Minimum Data Set, or MDS. For
SNF PPS purposes, the MDS data are used to classify SNF patients into one of 44
Resource Utilization Groups, Version III ("RUG-III") based on the medical
services and functional support the patient is expected to need. Each RUG-III
group is assigned an index score that factors the amount of staff time,
supplies, and services used, on average, for patients classified in that group.
The payments received under the SNF PPS are intended generally to cover all
inpatient services for Medicare patients, including routine nursing care, most
capital-related costs associated with the inpatient stay, and ancillary
services, such as respiratory therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and
certain covered drugs.

     Under the SNF PPS, per diem payments are made to nursing home facilities
for each resident. Upon the expiration of the three-year transition period,
these per diem payments would be fully transitioned into the federal SNF PPS
rates. During the transition period, payments are based on a blended rate that
uses both a facility-specific rate and the federal rate. As a result of SNF PPS,
Medicare payments to SNFs dropped by 12.5% in 1999. Additionally, the SNF PPS
forced SNFs to make expensive administrative adjustments to implement the
payment system. Although there has been some payment relief (as described
below), there can be no assurance that the reimbursement levels under the SNF
PPS will be sufficient to permit the Company's operators to satisfy their
obligations, including payment of rent under their leases with the Company.

     With respect to Medicaid, the Budget Act repealed the "Boren Amendment"
federal payment standard for Medicaid payments to hospitals and nursing
facilities effective October 1, 1997, giving states greater latitude in setting
payment rates for these providers.

     The Budget Act also affected the payments made to LTACs by reducing the
amount of reimbursement for incentive payments established pursuant to the
TEFRA, for capital expenditures and bad debts, and for services to certain
patients transferred from an acute care hospital. In addition, the Budget Act
for the first time imposed a national ceiling limitation or "national cap" on
payments that may be made in each category of hospitals exempt from a
prospective payment system. LTACs constitute one such category. The Budget Act
also mandated the creation of a prospective payment system ("LTAC PPS") for
LTACs.

     In response to widespread healthcare industry concern about the effects of
the Budget Act, the Federal government enacted the Refinement Act on November
29, 1999. The Refinement Act did not enact any fundamental changes in the
Medicare system, but rather reversed or delayed some of the reductions in
Medicare payment increases mandated by the Budget Act. It was estimated that in
the four to five fiscal years after its enactment, the Refinement Act would
return to healthcare providers approximately $16 billion of the $115 billion the
Budget Act was expected to cut from increases to the Medicare program. Specific
providers who received relief under the Refinement Act included SNFs, which
received temporary (effective April 1, 2000 to October 1, 2000) per diem payment
increases for certain high cost patients, and outpatient rehabilitation therapy
providers, which received a 2-year moratorium on a $1,500 annual cap on the
amount of physical, occupational and speech therapy provided to a patient.
Pursuant to BIPA, CMS extended the moratorium on the $1,500 annual cap to
December 31, 2002.

     In its July 31, 2000 final rule ("Final Refinement Act Rule") refining the
SNF PPS, CMS announced increases in payment rates for fiscal year 2001. In its
earlier proposed rule, issued on April 10, 2000, CMS had detailed proposed
refinements to be made to the SNF PPS case-mix classification system that would
more adequately account for high cost cases. Specifically, the agency developed
new categories of service classifications for payment purposes and proposed to
increase reimbursement rates for higher cost cases using a new index system
based on patient clinical variables. The Final Refinement Act Rule postponed any
such refinements to the SNF PPS case-mix classification system, while retaining
two temporary remedies set forth in the Refinement Act: (a) a 4% increase in the
per diem reimbursement rates for all RUG-III groups in both fiscal years 2001
and 2002; and (2) an additional 20% increase in the per diem reimbursement for
fifteen RUG-III groups falling under the Extensive Services, Special Care,
Clinically Complex, High Rehabilitation and Medium Rehabilitation categories,
applicable to services furnished on or after April 1, 2000, until such time as
case-mix refinements are implemented.

     Passed in December 2000, BIPA provided a certain degree of relief from the
projected impact of the Budget Act. Specifically, BIPA modified the impact of
the Refinement Act on SNF PPS payment rates, as implemented by the Final
Refinement Act Rule, in several important ways. First, BIPA revised the annual
market basket update factor upward from "market basket--1%" to (a) "market
basket" in fiscal year 2001, and (b) "market basket--

                                       14

<PAGE>

0.5%" in fiscal years 2002 and 2003. Second, BIPA temporarily increased the
nursing component of the federal SNF PPS rate by 16.6%, from April 1, 2001
through September 30, 2002. Finally, BIPA increased the per diem reimbursement
rates for fourteen rehabilitation-related RUG-III groups by 6.7%, from April 1,
2001 until such time as case-mix refinements are implemented pursuant to the
Refinement Act. To date, CMS has not promulgated the SNF PPS case-mix
refinements required by the Refinement Act. As a result, the temporary per diem
payment increases for specified RUG-III groups have been retained for an
unspecified period of time, with certain budget-neutral changes to the size and
allocation of such increases among different RUG-III groups. However, CMS has
indicated that the RUG-III refinements may be incorporated into a final rule
scheduled for release by July 31, 2002 and implementation in fiscal year 2003.

     With respect to LTACs, BIPA mandated that HHS implement the LTAC PPS by
October 1, 2002. Unless the Secretary of HHS develops a system of
diagnosis-related groups ("DRGs") specifically refined for LTACs before that
date, the LTAC PPS will be implemented using the DRGs currently used for
inpatient stays in acute care hospitals (modified, if feasible, to account for
the resource usage of long-term care patients, as well as the most recently
available hospital discharge data). In the interim, LTACs continue to be
reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis, subject to a facility-specific target
amount, and subject also to a national cap. For cost reporting periods during
fiscal year 2001, BIPA raised the applicable national cap for LTACs by 2%. BIPA
also raised the target amount for LTACs by 25%, though this revised target
amount cannot exceed the wage-adjusted national cap.

     On March 22, 2002, CMS published a proposed rule for LTAC PPS. The Company
is currently analyzing the proposed rule. The public will have 60 days from
March 22, 2002 to review the proposed rule and submit comments. In response to
comments submitted by the public and its own ongoing review of the proposed
rule, CMS may modify the proposed rule before it is adopted in final form. There
can be no assurance as to the content of the final rule for LTAC PPS, nor can we
predict its impact on the Company's tenants and operators.

     There can be no assurance that the Budget Act, the Refinement Act, BIPA and
future healthcare legislation, or other changes in the administration or
interpretation of governmental healthcare programs will not have a material
adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition or results of operations of
the Company's operators which could have a material adverse effect on their
ability to make rental payments to the Company.

Recent Developments Regarding Government Regulation

     Recent legislation and implementing regulations set forth revised payment
mechanisms for skilled nursing facility and long-term care hospital services.
The precise overall economic impact of new laws and other recent developments is
under review by the long-term care industry and by the Company and its
operators.

     In its annual update for 2002 ("2002 Final Rule"), CMS announced SNF
payment increases effective October 1, 2001. The 2002 Final Rule reflects an
update using a 2.8% market basket and is intended to implement both Refinement
Act and BIPA adjustments. The rule reflects the Refinement Act's and BIPA's
temporary increase to the per diem adjusted payment rates to certain RUG-III
groups, as well as BIPA's 16.6% adjustment to the nursing component of the
Federal rate. These increases are to continue until the implementation of
case-mix refinements. Also provided in the 2002 Final Rule is the Refinement
Act's 4% increase in the adjusted Federal rate for fiscal year 2002. There can
be no assurance that the give back provisions under the Refinement Act and BIPA
will continue after September 30, 2002.

     The 16.6% temporary increase to the nursing home RUG-III groups and the 4%
add-on for all RUG-III groups provided under the Refinement Act and BIPA expire
on September 30, 2002. Expiring provisions are estimated to, on average, reduce
per beneficiary per diems by $57. Moreover, CMS has informally indicated that it
intends to complete refinements to the SNF PPS as part of the upcoming fiscal
year 2003 rulemaking. Under applicable law, when these revisions are
implemented, the 6.7% increase for rehabilitation patients and the 20% add-on
for medically complex patients authorized under the Refinement Act and BIPA will
expire.

     LTACs, which are currently excluded from a prospective payment system, are
scheduled to transition to LTAC PPS by October 1, 2002. The new prospective
payment system for LTACs would apply to cost report periods beginning on or
after October 1, 2002. The Company believes that the new prospective payment
system would impact Kindred no sooner than September 1, 2003. As noted
previously, if HHS cannot implement a prospective payment system specific to
LTACs by October 1, 2002, it is required to instead implement a prospective
payment system based upon existing acute care hospital diagnosis-related groups
that have been modified where possible to account for resource usage of LTAC
patients. On March 22, 2002, CMS published a proposed rule for LTAC PPS. The
Company is currently analyzing the proposed rule. The public will have 60 days
from March 22, 2002 to review the proposed rule and submit comments. In response
to comments submitted by the public and its own ongoing review of the proposed
rule, CMS may modify the proposed rule before it is adopted in final form.
There can be no assurance as to the content of the final rule for LTAC PPS, nor
can we predict its impact on the Company's tenants and operators. The Company
believes that the new prospective payment system would impact Kindred no sooner
than September 1, 2003.

     On November 20, 2001, CMS announced a proposed regulation ("Proposed
Regulation") to restrict the "upper-payment limit loophole" in Medicaid. The
Proposed Regulation revises a provision of an earlier regulation published on
January 12, 2001 that allowed states to make overall payments to public
non-state government owned or operated hospitals of up to 150 percent of the
estimated amount that would be paid under Medicare for the same

                                       15

<PAGE>

services. Under the Proposed Regulation, these payments would be limited to 100
percent of estimated Medicare payments, which is the limit for all other
hospitals. The resulting effect of the Proposed Rule is that states may
implement rate or service cuts to providers (including SNFs) to compensate for
reduced federal funding. To date, CMS has not issued the final regulations.

     Approximately two-thirds of all nursing home residents are dependent on
Medicaid. Medicaid reimbursement rates, however, typically are less than the
amounts charged by the operators of the Company's properties. Moreover, rising
Medicaid costs and decreasing state revenues caused by the current recession
have prompted an increasing number of states to cut Medicaid funding as a means
of balancing their respective state budgets. Existing and future initiatives
affecting Medicaid reimbursement may reduce utilization of (and reimbursement
for) services offered by the operators of the Company's properties.

     There can be no assurance that future healthcare legislation or changes in
the administration or implementation of governmental healthcare reimbursement
programs will not have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company's operators and tenants which
could have a material adverse effect on their ability to make rental payments to
the Company which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the
business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity of the Company
and on the Company's ability to service its indebtedness and its obligations
under the United States Settlement and on the Company's ability to make
distributions to its stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT
(a "Material Adverse Effect").

Federal Income Tax Considerations

     The Company elected to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes
for the year ended December 31, 1999. The Company believes that it has satisfied
the requirements to qualify as a REIT for the years ended December 31, 2000 and
2001. The Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income
tax purposes for the year ended December 31, 2002 and subsequent years subject
to its ability to meet the minimum distribution requirements as discussed below.
The Company's continued qualification and taxation as a REIT will depend upon
its ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual annual operating
results, distribution levels, and stock ownership, the various qualification
tests imposed under the Code. These tests are discussed below. No assurance can
be given that the actual results of the Company's operations for any particular
taxable year will satisfy such requirements. Although the Company believes it
has satisfied the requirements to continue to qualify as a REIT for years ended
December 31, 2000 and 2001 and although the Company currently intends to
continue to qualify as a REIT for the year ended December 31, 2002 and
subsequent years, it is possible that economic, market, legal, tax or other
considerations may cause the Company to fail, or elect not, to continue to
qualify as a REIT. For a discussion of the tax consequences of failing to
continue to qualify as a REIT, see "--Failure to Continue to Qualify," below.

     The discussion of "Federal Income Tax Considerations" set forth herein is
not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations and is not tax advice.
Moreover, this summary does not deal with all tax aspects that might be relevant
to a particular stockholder in light of such stockholder's circumstances, nor
does it deal with particular types of stockholders that are subject to special
treatment under the Code, such as insurance companies, financial institutions
and broker-dealers. The Code provisions governing the federal income tax
treatment of REITs are highly technical and complex, and this summary is
qualified in its entirety by the applicable Code provisions, rules and Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder, and administrative and judicial
interpretations thereof. The following discussion is based on current law, which
could be changed at any time, possibly retroactively.

Federal Income Taxation of the Company

     If the Company continues to qualify for taxation as a REIT, it generally
will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on net income that it
currently distributes to stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates
the "double taxation" (i.e., taxation at both the corporate and stockholder
levels) that generally results from investment in a corporation. Notwithstanding
its qualification as a REIT, the Company will be subject to federal income tax
in the following circumstances. First, the Company will be taxed at regular
corporate rates on any undistributed taxable income, including undistributed net
capital gains. Second, under certain circumstances, the Company may be subject
to the "alternative minimum tax" on its undistributed items of tax preference.
Third, if the Company has (i) net income from the sale or other disposition of
"foreclosure property" (which is, in general, property acquired by foreclosure
or otherwise on default of a loan secured by the property or property
repossessed by the Company upon dispossessing a tenant after a lease default)
that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business
or (ii) other non-qualifying income from foreclosure property, it will be
subject to tax at the highest corporate rate on such income. Fourth, if the
Company has net income from "prohibited transactions" (which are, in general,
certain sales or other dispositions of property (other than foreclosure
property) held primarily for sale to

                                       16

<PAGE>

customers in the ordinary course of business), such income will be subject to a
100% tax. Fifth, if the Company should fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test
or the 95% gross income test (as discussed below), and has nonetheless
maintained its qualification as a REIT because certain other requirements have
been met, it will be subject to a 100% tax on the product of (a) the gross
income attributable to the greater of the amount by which the Company fails the
75% or 95% gross income test, and (b) a fraction intended to reflect the
Company's profitability. Sixth, if the Company should fail to distribute during
each calendar year at least the sum of (i) 85% of its REIT ordinary income for
such year, (ii) 95% of its REIT capital gain net income for such year (other
than retained long-term capital gain the Company elects to treat as having been
distributed to stockholders), and (iii) any undistributed taxable income from
prior years, the Company would be subject to a non-deductible 4% excise tax on
the excess of such required distribution over the amounts actually distributed.
Seventh, if the Company should receive rents from a tenant deemed not to be fair
market value rents, or if the Company values its assets incorrectly, the Company
may be liable for valuation penalties. Finally, if the Company acquires any
asset from a C corporation (i.e., a corporation generally subject to full
corporate level tax) in a transaction in which the basis of the asset in the
Company's hands is determined by reference to the basis of the asset (or any
other asset) in the hands of the C corporation, and the Company recognizes gain
on the disposition of such asset during the 10-year period (the "Recognition
Period") beginning on the date on which such asset was acquired by the Company,
then, to the extent of such asset's "Built-in Gain" (i.e., the excess of the
fair market value of such property at the time of acquisition by the Company
over the adjusted basis of such asset at such time), such gain will be subject
to tax at the highest regular corporate rate (the "Built-in Gain Rules")).

     The Company owns appreciated assets that it held on January 1, 1999, the
effective date of its REIT election. These assets are subject to the Built-in
Gain Rules discussed above because the Company was a taxable C corporation prior
to January 1, 1999. If the Company recognizes taxable gain upon the disposition
of any of these assets within the ten-year Recognition Period, the Company
generally will be subject to regular corporate income tax on the gain equal to
the lower of (a) the recognized gain at the time of the disposition and (b) the
Built-in Gain in that asset as of January 1, 1999. The total amount of gain on
which the Company can be taxed under the Built-in Gain Rules is limited to its
net built-in gain at the time it became a REIT, i.e., the excess of the
aggregate fair market value of its assets at the time it became a REIT over the
adjusted tax bases of those assets at that time. Some but not all of such
capital gains realized would be offset by the amount of any available capital
loss carryforwards. In connection with the sale of any assets, all or a portion
of such gain could be treated as ordinary income instead of capital gain and be
subject to taxation and/or the minimum REIT distribution requirements. See
"--Annual Distribution Requirements" below.

Requirements for Qualification

     To continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company must continue to meet the
requirements discussed below, relating to the Company's organization, sources of
income, nature of assets and distributions of income to stockholders.

Organizational Requirements

     The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association (i) that is
managed by one or more directors or trustees; (ii) the beneficial ownership of
which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of
beneficial interest; (iii) that would be taxable as a domestic corporation, but
for Sections 856 through 859 of the Code; (iv) that is neither a financial
institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the Code;
(v) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons during at
least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of
a shorter taxable year (the "100 Shareholder Rule"); (vi) not more than 50% in
value of the outstanding stock of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by
five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities)
during the last half of each taxable year (the "5/50 Rule"); (vii) that makes an
election to be a REIT (or has made such election for a previous taxable year)
and satisfies all relevant filing and other administrative requirements
established by the Internal Revenue Service that must be met in order to elect
and to maintain REIT status; (viii) that uses a calendar year for federal income
tax purposes; and (ix) that meets certain other tests, described below,
regarding the nature of its income and assets.

     For purposes of the 5/50 Rule, an unemployment compensation benefits plan,
a private foundation or a portion of a trust permanently set aside or used
exclusively for charitable purposes generally is considered an individual. A
trust that is a qualified trust under Section 401(a) of the Code, however,
generally is not considered an individual and the beneficiaries of such trust
are treated as holding shares of a REIT in proportion to their actuarial
interests in such trust for purposes of the 5/50 Rule. Certain entities,
including entities that file Schedules 13 D, F or G with the Commission, are not
treated as a single owner under the 5/50 Rule. For purposes of the 5/50 Rule,
the beneficial owners of such entities are deemed to be the owners of the
Company's Common Stock. A REIT will be treated as having satisfied the 5/50 Rule
if it complies with certain regulations for ascertaining the ownership of its
stock and if

                                       17

<PAGE>

it did not know (or after the exercise of reasonable diligence would not have
known) that its stock was sufficiently closely held to cause it to violate the
5/50 Rule. See "--Annual Record Keeping Requirements" below.

     In order to prevent a concentration of ownership of the Company's stock
that would cause the Company to fail the 5/50 Rule or the 100 Shareholder Rule,
the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation on April 30, 1998 to
provide that, except with the consent of the Company's Board of Directors, no
holder (with certain exceptions) is permitted to own, either actually or
constructively under the applicable attribution rules of the Code, more than
9.0% of the Common Stock or 9.9% of any class of preferred stock issued by the
Company. Certain persons (an "Existing Holder") who owned stock in the Company
in excess of the foregoing limits on April 30, 1998 (the date that the
Certificate of Incorporation was amended) are not subject to the general
ownership limits applicable to other stockholders; rather, Existing Holders
generally are permitted to own up to the same percentage of the Company's
outstanding stock that they owned on April 30, 1998. No holder, however, is
permitted to own, either actually or constructively under the applicable
attribution rules of the Code, any shares of any class of the Company's stock if
such ownership would cause more than 50% in value of the Company's outstanding
stock to be owned by five or fewer individuals or would result in the Company's
stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined without
reference to any rule of attribution).

     Since the date of the 1998 Spin Off, Tenet Healthcare Corporation ("Tenet")
has owned approximately 12% of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Stock
and, therefore, is treated as an Existing Holder under the Company's Certificate
of Incorporation. Except as explained below, as an Existing Holder, Tenet is
generally permitted to own in excess of the ownership limits in the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation.

     As permitted by its certificate of incorporation, the Company previously
granted waivers of the ownership limitations to certain stockholders of the
Company. These waivers initially permitted such stockholders to own over 10% of
the Common Stock of the Company but in no event more than 15% of the Common
Stock. These waivers have either been terminated in their entirety or have been
subsequently revised to restrict the ownership of Common Stock by any such
stockholder to less than 10% of the Company's issued and outstanding Common
Stock. The Company believes that no stockholder, other than Tenet, owns 10% or
more of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Stock, as measured by the
Code.

     To qualify as a REIT, a corporation may not have (as of the end of the
taxable year) any earnings and profits that were accumulated in periods before
it elected REIT status. The Company believes that at December 31, 1999 it did
not have any accumulated earnings and profits that are attributable to periods
during which the Company was not a REIT, although the IRS would be entitled to
challenge that determination. For taxable years beginning after 2000 (and the
Company believes for the taxable year 2000), a distribution made to meet the
requirement that a REIT may not have non-REIT earnings and profits will be
treated, on a first-in, first-out basis, as made from earnings and profits.
Thus, such earnings and profits are deemed distributed first from earnings and
profits that would cause such a failure, starting with the earliest Company year
for which such failure would occur.

     Section 856(i) of the Code provides that a corporation that is a "Qualified
REIT Subsidiary" will not be treated as a separate corporation for federal
income tax purposes, and all assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction
and credit of a qualified REIT subsidiary will be treated as assets,
liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of the REIT. A
"qualified subsidiary" is defined as any wholly owned corporate subsidiary of a
REIT. The Company currently has two qualified REIT subsidiaries, Ventas
Specialty I, Inc. and Ventas Finance I, Inc.

     Pursuant to Treasury Regulations relating to entity classification (the
"Check-the-Box Regulations"), an unincorporated entity that has a single owner
is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for federal income tax
purposes. The Company directly owns a 99% general partnership interest in Ventas
Realty and indirectly owns the remaining 1% limited partnership interest in
Ventas Realty through a wholly owned limited liability company. Under the
Check-the-Box Regulations, the limited liability Company, and therefore Ventas
Realty, is disregarded as an entity separate from the Company for federal income
tax purposes. Similarly, Ventas Specialty I, LLC and Ventas Finance I, LLC,
formed in connection with the CMBS Transaction, are also wholly owned, single
member limited liability companies that are disregarded for federal income tax
purposes.

     In the case of a REIT that is a partner in a partnership, Treasury
regulations provide that the REIT will be deemed to own its proportionate share
of the assets of the partnership and will be deemed to be entitled to the income
of the partnership attributable to such share. In addition, the character of the
assets and gross income of the partnership will retain the same character in the
hands of the REIT for purposes of the income and asset tests described below. If
and when Ventas Realty were to admit a partner other than the Company, a
subsidiary of the Company, or an entity that is disregarded under the
Check-the-Box Regulations as an entity separate from the Company, the Company's
proportionate share of the assets and gross income of Ventas Realty would be
treated as

                                       18

<PAGE>

the assets and gross income of the Company for purposes of applying the
requirements described herein.

Income Tests

     To continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company must satisfy certain annual
gross income requirements. First, at least 75% of the Company's gross income
(excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must
consist of defined types of income derived directly or indirectly from
investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property (including
"rents from real property" (defined below)) and, in certain circumstances,
interest on certain types of temporary investment income. Second, at least 95%
of the Company's gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited
transactions) for each taxable year must be derived from such real property or
temporary investments, dividends, interest and gain from the sale or disposition
of stock or securities, or from any combination of the foregoing.

     Substantially all of the Company's gross income is derived from leasing its
properties to Kindred under the Master Leases. Rents received or deemed received
by the Company under its leases (including the Master Leases) will qualify as
"rents from real property" in satisfying the gross income requirements described
above only if the Company's leases are respected as "true" leases for federal
income tax purposes and are not treated as service contracts, joint ventures, or
some other type of arrangement. The determination of whether the Company's
leases are true leases depends on an analysis of all the surrounding facts and
circumstances. In making such a determination, courts have considered a variety
of factors, including the following: (i) the intent of the parties, (ii) the
form of the agreement, (iii) the degree of control over the property that is
retained by the property owner (e.g., whether the lessee has substantial control
over the operation of the property or whether the lessee was required to use its
best efforts to perform its obligations under the agreement), and (iv) the
extent to which the property owner retains the risk of loss with respect to the
property (e.g., whether the lessee bears the risk of increases in operating
expenses or the risk of damage to the property) or the potential for economic
gains (e.g., appreciation) with respect to the property. Based upon advice of
counsel at the time the Master Leases were negotiated, the Company believes that
its leases should be treated as "true" leases for federal income tax purposes.
Investors should be aware, however, that there are no controlling Treasury
regulations, published rulings, or judicial decisions involving leases with
terms substantially the same as the Company's leases that discuss whether such
leases constitute true leases for federal income tax purposes. If the leases are
recharacterized as service contracts or partnership agreements, rather than true
leases, part or all of the payments that the Company receives from its tenants
would not be considered rent or would not otherwise satisfy the various
requirements for qualification as "rents from real property." In that case, the
Company likely would not be able to satisfy either the 75% or the 95% gross
income tests, and, as a result, would lose its REIT status.

     Assuming that the Company's leases are "true" leases for tax purposes,
rents received by the Company will qualify as "rents from real property" for
purposes of the REIT gross income tests only if several additional conditions
are satisfied. First, the amount of rent generally must not be based in whole or
in part on the income or profits of any person. However, an amount received or
accrued generally will not be excluded from the term "rents from real property"
solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts
or sales.

     Second, amounts received from a tenant will not qualify as "rents from real
property" if the Company, or an owner of 10% or more of the Company, directly or
constructively is deemed to own 10% or more of the ownership interests in the
tenant (a "Related Party Tenant").

     Third, if rent attributable to personal property, leased in connection with
a lease of real property, is greater than 15% of the total rent received under
the lease (based on the fair market values after 2000), then the portion of rent
attributable to such personal property will not qualify as "rents from real
property."

     Finally, for rents received to qualify as "rents from real property," the
Company generally must not operate or manage the property or furnish or render
services to the tenants of such property, other than through an "independent
contractor" who is adequately compensated and from whom the Company derives no
income. The "independent contractor" requirement, however, does not apply to the
extent that the services provided by the Company are "usually or customarily
rendered in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only," which are
services of a type that a tax-exempt organization can provide to its tenants
without causing its rental income to be unrelated business taxable income
("UBTI"). In addition, the "independent contractor" requirement does not apply
to noncustomary services provided by the Company, the annual value of which does
not exceed 1% of the gross income derived from the property with respect to
which the services are provided (the "1% de minimis exception"). For this
purpose, such services may not be valued at less than 150% of the Company's
direct cost of providing the services. An "independent contractor" is defined as
an entity that does not own (directly or indirectly) more than 35% of the
Company's stock or an entity not more than 35% owned (directly or indirectly) by
persons who own more than 35% of the Company's stock. If any class of stock of
the Company or the person being tested as

                                       19

<PAGE>

an independent contractor is regularly traded on an established securities
market, only persons who directly or indirectly own 5% or more of such class of
stock shall be counted in determining whether the 35% ownership limitations have
been exceeded. Certain of the foregoing rules are modified if the Company forms
a taxable REIT Subsidiary. See "--Taxable REIT Subsidiary."

     The Company does not believe that it has, and does not anticipate that it
will in the future, (i) charged/charge rent that is based in whole or in part on
the income or profits of any person (except by reason of being based on a fixed
percentage or percentages of receipts or sales consistent with the rule
described above), (ii) derived/derive rent attributable to personal property
leased in connection with real property that exceeds 15% of the total rents,
(iii) derived/derive rent attributable to a Related Party Tenant, or (iv)
provided/provide any noncustomary services to tenants other than through
qualifying independent contractors, except as permitted by the 1% de minimis
exception or to the extent that the amount of resulting nonqualifying income
would not cause the Company to fail to satisfy the 95% and 75% gross income
tests.

Related Party Tenant

     The Company leases substantially all of its properties to Kindred and
Kindred is the primary source of the Company's rental revenues. Under the
Kindred Reorganization Plan, Ventas Realty received 1,498,500 shares of Kindred
common stock on the Kindred Effective Date. Under the Code, if the Company owns
10% or more of any class of Kindred's issued and outstanding voting securities
or 10% or more of the value of any class of Kindred's issued and outstanding
securities (the "10% securities test"), Kindred would be a Related Party Tenant.
As a Related Party Tenant, the Company's rental revenue from Kindred would not
qualify as "rents from real property" and the Company would lose its REIT status
because it likely would not be able to satisfy either the 75% or the 95% gross
income test. The Company's loss of REIT status would have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

     Since the Kindred Effective Date, Kindred has issued additional common
stock and Ventas Realty has disposed of 418,186 shares of its Kindred common
stock. As of January 22, 2002, the Company owned 1,080,314 shares of Kindred
common stock or not more than 6.2% of the issued and outstanding shares of
Kindred. Based upon applicable tax authorities and decisions and advice from the
Internal Revenue Service, the Company believes that for purposes of the 10%
securities test, its ownership percentage in Kindred has been and will continue
to be less than 9.99%.

     A number of safeguards are in place to reduce the risk of the Company's
violation of the 10% securities test as a result of its ownership of Kindred
common stock including: (a) a provision in Kindred's corporate charter requiring
Kindred, at the Company's sole option, to purchase a portion of the Company's
Kindred common stock in the event Kindred proposes to enter into a transaction
which would cause the Company to violate the 10% securities test, and (b) the
Company's ability to sell the Kindred common stock to a third party or
distribute the Kindred common stock to its stockholders, subject to compliance
with the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See "-- Recent
Developments Regarding Kindred--Registration Rights Agreement."

     The Company believes that the only greater than 10% stockholder of the
Company's Common Stock, as measured by the Code, is Tenet. Since the date of the
1998 Spin Off, Tenet has owned approximately 12% of the Company's issued and
outstanding Common Stock. Certain provisions under the Code provide that any
ownership interest in Kindred that Tenet may purchase may be attributed to the
Company. Any such attribution could cause to Company to violate the 10%
securities test and lose its REIT status unless under applicable laws, rules and
regulations or interpretations, the Company is otherwise deemed not to have
violated the 10% securities test. To reduce the likelihood of such an
occurrence, the Company has implemented certain protective measures. As part of
the Kindred Reorganization Plan, the Company negotiated for the inclusion of
Article Tenth of the Kindred Corporate Charter. Article Tenth of the Kindred
Corporate Charter, which became effective on the Kindred Effective Date, is
designed to prohibit Tenet from gaining beneficial ownership of any Kindred
common stock if such ownership when combined with the Company's ownership would
exceed 9.9% of any class of stock or all stock in the aggregate. If Tenet should
nevertheless violate this provision, either directly or as a result of the
attribution rules under the Code, any shares of the Kindred common stock so
purchased by or attributed to Tenet will automatically, without any action by
any party, become "Excess Stock" in Kindred and will be deemed to be owned by a
trust for the benefit of a third party and Tenet will have no legal title to
such "Excess Stock" in Kindred. Tenet would have the limited right to receive
certain distributions on and a certain portion of the proceeds of a sale of such
"Excess Stock" in Kindred.

     In addition, under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, under a
formal interpretation by the Board of Directors, if Tenet should purchase any
Kindred common stock while Tenet owns in excess of 10% of the Company's Common
Stock, then all of Tenet's holdings of the Company's Common Stock in excess of
9.9% will automatically become "Excess Shares" in the Company and will be deemed
to be owned by a trust for the benefit

                                       20

<PAGE>

of a third party and Tenet would have no legal title to such "Excess Shares" in
the Company. Tenet would have the limited right to receive certain distributions
on and a certain portion of the proceeds of a sale of such Excess Shares in the
Company.

     While the Company believes that these and other safeguards which have been
instituted by the Company are adequate, there can be no assurances that such
safeguards will be adequate to prevent the Company from violating the 10%
securities test. If the Company should ever violate the 10% securities test, the
Company would lose its status as a REIT which would have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

     If the Company fails to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income
tests for any taxable year, it may nevertheless continues to qualify as a REIT
for such year if it is entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code.
These relief provisions generally will be available if the Company's failure to
meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the
Company attaches a schedule of the sources of its income to its return and any
incorrect information on the schedules was not due to fraud with intent to evade
tax. It is not possible, however, to state whether in all circumstances the
Company would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. Even if
these relief provisions were to apply, a tax would be imposed with respect to
the excess net income.

Foreclosure Property

   General

     The foreclosure property rules permit the Company (by the Company's
election) to foreclose or repossess properties without being disqualified as a
result of receiving income that does not qualify under the gross income tests;
however, a corporate tax is imposed upon net income from "foreclosure property"
that is not otherwise "good REIT" income. Detailed rules specify the calculation
of the tax. The after tax amount increases the amount the REIT must distribute
each year.

     "Foreclosure property" includes any real property and any personal property
incident to such real property acquired by bid at foreclosure or by agreement or
process of law after there was a default or a default was imminent on the leased
property. During a 90-day grace period, the Company may operate the foreclosed
property without an "independent contractor" or qualifying lessee. The 90-day
grace period will begin on the date the Company acquires possession of the
property.

     To maintain foreclosure property treatment after the 90 day grace period,
the Company must cause the property to be managed by an "independent contractor"
(from whom the Company derives or receives no income) or lease the property
pursuant to a lease qualifying as a true lease for income tax purposes to an
unrelated third party. Ownership of the tenant must not be attributed to the
Company in violation of the related tenant rule of Section 856(d)(2)(B)
(relating to 10% or more owned tenants). If the property is leased to a third
party under a true lease, the foreclosure property rules are not then relevant.

     Foreclosure property treatment will end on the first day on which the REIT
enters into a lease of the property that will give rise to income that is not
good rental income under Section 856(c)(3). In addition, foreclosure property
treatment will end if any construction takes place on the property (other than
completion of a building, or other improvement more than 10 percent complete
before default became imminent). Foreclosure property treatment is available for
an initial period of three years, provided that such treatment may be extended
up to six years.

   Healthcare Properties

     The Company is permitted to terminate leases of "qualified healthcare
properties" other than by reason of default or imminent default. In addition,
the Company may treat "qualified healthcare properties" as foreclosure property
at the time a lease comes to an end. Except as noted below, healthcare
foreclosure properties are subject to the foreclosure property tax and other
rules under the general foreclosure property rules.

     The differences between this special healthcare rule and the general
foreclosure rule are that (i) the initial foreclosure property period is for two
rather than three years, although it may be extended for the same aggregate six
years, (ii) the lease may be terminated without requirement of default, and
(iii) income from the independent contractor is disregarded to the extent such
income is attributable to any lease of property in effect on the date of
acquisition or any lease of property entered into after such date if on such
date a lease of the new property from the REIT was in effect, and under the
terms of the new lease, the REIT receives no more than substantially the same
benefit in comparison to the lease previously in effect.

                                       21

<PAGE>

     A "qualified healthcare property" includes any real property and any
personal property incident to such real property which is a "healthcare
facility" or is necessary or incidental to the use of a healthcare facility. The
qualified healthcare facility may be operated by an independent contractor from
whom the REIT does not derive or receive any income other than certain
qualifying lease income from an independent contractor.

Asset Tests

     At the close of each quarter of its taxable year, the Company must satisfy
two tests relating to the nature of its assets. First, at least 75% of the value
of the Company's total assets must be represented by cash or cash items
(including certain receivables), government securities, "real estate assets" or,
in cases where the Company raises new capital through stock or long-term
(maturity of at least five years) debt offerings, temporary investments in stock
or debt instruments during the one-year period following the Company's receipt
of such capital (the "75% asset test"). The term "real estate asset" includes
interests in real property, interests in mortgages on real property to the
extent the mortgage balance does not exceed the value of the associated real
property, and shares of other REITs. For purposes of the 75% asset test, the
term "interest in real property" includes an interest in land and improvements
thereon, such as buildings or other inherently permanent structures (including
items that are structural components of such buildings or structures), a
leasehold in real property and an option to acquire real property (or a
leasehold in real property). Second, of the investments not included in the 75%
asset class, the value of any one issuer's debt and equity securities owned by
the Company (other than the Company's interest in any entity classified as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes, or the stock of a qualified REIT
subsidiary) may not exceed 5% of the value of the Company's total assets (the
"5% asset test"), and the Company may not own more than 10% of any one issuer's
outstanding voting securities or 10% of the value of any one issuer's
outstanding securities, subject to limited "safe harbor" exceptions for certain
straight debt obligations (except for the Company's ownership interest in an
entity that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes, that is classified
as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that is the stock of a
qualified REIT subsidiary) (previously defined as the "10% securities test"). In
addition, no more than 20% of the value of the Company's assets can be
represented by securities of Taxable REIT Subsidiaries (as defined below).

     If the Company should fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a
calendar quarter except for its first calendar quarter, such a failure would not
cause it to fail to qualify as a REIT or to lose its REIT status if (i) it
satisfied all of the asset tests at the close of the preceding calendar quarter
and (ii) the discrepancy between the value of the Company's assets and the asset
test requirements arose from changes in the market values of its assets and was
not wholly or partly caused by an acquisition of nonqualifying assets. If the
condition described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence were not satisfied,
the Company still could avoid disqualification by eliminating any discrepancy
within 30 days after the close of the calendar quarter in which it arose. The
Company intends to maintain adequate records of the value of its assets to
ensure compliance with the asset tests and to take such other actions as may be
required to comply with those tests.

     The Company believes it has been and will continue to be in compliance with
the 10% securities test and the 5% asset test. However, there can be differing
opinions as to the methods of calculating compliance with these tests and as to
the value of the Company's assets (including the valuation of the Kindred common
stock) for purposes of these tests. Therefore, there can be no assurance the
Company is or will continue to be in compliance with either of these tests. If
the Company failed to satisfy either of these tests, the Company would lose its
REIT status. If the Company lost its status as a REIT, it would have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

Taxable REIT Subsidiaries

     The Company is permitted to own up to 100% of a "Taxable REIT Subsidiary."
To qualify as a taxable REIT subsidiary, both the Company and the subsidiary
corporation must join in an election to treat the subsidiary corporation as a
taxable REIT subsidiary. In addition, any corporation (other than a REIT or a
qualified REIT subsidiary) of which a taxable REIT subsidiary owns, directly or
indirectly, more than 35 percent of the vote or value is automatically treated
as a taxable REIT subsidiary.

     A taxable REIT subsidiary can provide services to tenants of the Company's
properties (even if such services were not considered services customarily
furnished in connection with the rental of real property), and can manage or
operate properties, generally for third parties, without causing amounts
received or accrued directly or indirectly by the Company for such activities to
fail to be treated as rents from real property. However, rents paid to the
Company generally are not qualified rents if the Company owns more than 10% (by
vote or value) of the corporation paying the rents. Nevertheless, qualified
rents do include rents that are paid by taxable REIT subsidiaries and that also
meet a limited rental exception (where 90% of space is leased to third parties
at comparable rents) and an exception for rents from certain lodging facilities
(operated by an independent contractor).

                                       22

<PAGE>

     Moreover, the taxable REIT subsidiary cannot directly or indirectly operate
or manage a lodging or healthcare facility, subject to special rules for certain
lodging facilities.

     Also, the taxable REIT subsidiary generally cannot provide to any person
rights to any brand name under which hotels or healthcare facilities are
operated, unless the rights are provided to an independent contractor to operate
or manage a lodging facility, if the rights are held by the taxable REIT
subsidiary as licensee or franchisee and the lodging facility is owned by the
taxable REIT subsidiary or leased to it by the Company.

     The taxable REIT subsidiary cannot deduct interest in any years that would
exceed 50% of the taxable REIT subsidiary's adjusted gross income. If any amount
of interest, rent, or other deductions of the taxable REIT subsidiary for
amounts paid to the Company is determined to be other than at arm's length
("redetermined" items pursuant to Section 482), an excise tax of 100% is imposed
on the portion that was excessive, with limited "safe harbor" exceptions.

     A 100% excise tax would be imposed on the Company for: (i) redetermined
rents, (ii) redetermined deductions, and (iii) excess interest. Redetermined
rents include "rents from real property" that would have been adjusted under
Section 482 (but for the imposition of the 100% tax) in an IRS audit to clearly
reflect income as a result of services furnished by a taxable REIT subsidiary to
the tenants of a REIT. Redetermined rents, however, would only include rents
attributable to "impermissible" services that exceed 1% of the total rents from
the property. In addition, redetermined rents would not include rents which
qualify for the following safe harbors: (i) the taxable REIT subsidiary charges
the same amounts for its services to the REIT and its tenants similar to other
third parties; (ii) the rents paid to the REIT by tenants (leasing at least 25%
of the net leasable space in the property) who are not receiving a service from
the taxable REIT subsidiary are substantially comparable to the rents paid by
tenants leasing comparable space and receiving such service from the taxable
REIT subsidiary, and the charge for such service is separately stated; and (iii)
the Taxable REIT Subsidiary recognizes income for its services at least equal to
150% of its direct costs in furnishing or rendering the service.

     Redetermined deductions include deductions (other than redetermined rents)
of a Taxable REIT Subsidiary that would have been adjusted under Section 482
(but for the imposition of the 100% tax) in an IRS audit to clearly reflect
income between the taxable REIT subsidiary and REIT.

     Excess interest would include any deduction for interest payments by a
taxable REIT subsidiary to the REIT to the extent such interest payments are in
excess of a rate that is "commercially reasonable." Loans from the REIT to a
taxable REIT subsidiary would be made subject to the Section 163(j) "earnings
stripping" rules in full (i.e., the rules would apply to the taxable REIT
subsidiary regardless of the underlying ownership of the REIT).

Annual Distribution Requirements

     In order to be taxed as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute
dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to its stockholders in an amount
at least equal to (i) the sum of (A) 90% of the Company's "REIT taxable income"
(computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and its net capital
gain) and (B) 90% of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure
property, minus (ii) the sum of certain items of noncash income. Such
distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the
following taxable year if declared before the Company timely files its tax
return for such year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment
after such declaration. To the extent that the Company does not distribute all
of its net capital gain or distributes at least 90%, but less than 100%, of its
"REIT taxable income," as adjusted, it will be subject to tax on the
undistributed amount at regular capital gains and ordinary corporate tax rates
except to the extent of net operating loss or capital loss carryforwards. If any
taxes are paid in connection with the Built-In Gain Rules, these taxes will be
deductible in computing REIT taxable income. Furthermore, if the Company should
fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (i) 85% of its
REIT ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of its REIT capital gain net income
for such year (other than long-term capital gain the Company elects to retain
and treat as having been distributed to stockholders), and (iii) any
undistributed taxable income from prior periods, the Company will be subject to
a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over
the amounts actually distributed.

     It is expected that the Company's REIT taxable income will be less than its
cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non-cash deductions in
computing REIT taxable income. The Company anticipates that it generally will
have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable it to satisfy the 90%
distribution requirement. It is possible, however, that the Company, from time
to time, may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90%
distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be
necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, as a result of timing differences
between (i) the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible
expenses and (ii) the inclusion of such income and deduction of such expenses in
arriving at the Company's taxable income, or as a result of nondeductible
expenses such as principal amortization or repayments,

                                       23

<PAGE>

or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions. In the event that such
timing differences or other cash needs occur, the Company may find it necessary
to borrow funds or to issue equity securities (there being no assurance that it
will be able to do so) or, if possible, to pay taxable stock dividends,
distribute other property or securities (including the Kindred common stock) or
engage in a transaction intended to enable it to meet the REIT distribution
requirements. The Company's ability to engage in certain of these transactions
is restricted by the terms of the Credit Agreement. Any such transaction would
likely require the consent of the "Required Lenders" under the Credit Agreement,
and there can be no assurance that such consent would be obtained. The Company's
ability to engage in certain of these transactions is also restricted by the
registration requirements under the Securities Act, the rules and regulations of
the New York Stock Exchange and the Commission and by other applicable laws,
rules and regulations. In addition, the failure of Kindred to make rental
payments under the Master Leases would impair materially the ability of the
Company to make required distributions. Consequently, there can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to make distributions at the required distribution
rate or any other rate.

     Under certain circumstances, the Company may be able to rectify a failure
to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying "deficiency dividends"
to stockholders in a later year, which may be included in the Company's
deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year. Although the Company may be
able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends, it
will be required to pay a 4% excise tax and interest to the IRS based upon the
amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividends.

     The Company elected to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes
for the year ended December 31, 1999. The Company believes that it has satisfied
the requirements to qualify as a REIT for the years ended December 31, 2000 and
2001. Although the Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal
income tax purposes for the year ended December 31, 2002 and subsequent years,
it is possible that economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may
cause the Company to fail, or elect not, to continue to qualify as a REIT.

Annual Record Keeping Requirements

     In its first taxable year in which it qualifies as a REIT and thereafter,
the Company is required to maintain certain records and request on an annual
basis certain information from its stockholders designed to disclose the actual
ownership of its outstanding shares. The Company believes that it has complied
with these requirements for the 1999, 2000 and 2001 tax years. The Company will
be subject to a penalty of $25,000 ($50,000 for intentional violations) for any
year in which it does not comply with the rules.

Failure to Continue to Qualify

     If the Company's election to be taxed as a REIT is revoked or terminated
(e.g., due to a failure to meet the REIT qualification tests), the Company will
be subject to tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its
taxable income at regular corporate rates except to the extent of net operating
loss and capital loss carryforwards. Distributions to stockholders will not be
deductible by the Company, nor will they be required to be made. To the extent
of current and accumulated earnings and profits, all distributions to
stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income, and, subject to certain
limitations in the Code, corporate stockholders may be eligible for the
dividends received deduction. In addition, the Company would be prohibited from
re-electing REIT status for the four taxable years following the year during
which the Company ceased to qualify as a REIT, unless certain relief provisions
of the Code applied. It is impossible to predict whether the Company would be
entitled to such statutory relief.

Taxation of U.S. Stockholders

     As used herein, the term "U.S. Stockholder" means a holder of the Company's
Common Stock that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is (i) a citizen or
resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, partnership or other entity
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any
political subdivision thereof, (iii) an estate whose income from sources without
the United States is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax
purposes regardless of its connection with the conduct of a trade or business
within the United States or (iv) any trust with respect to which (A) a U.S.
court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such
trust and (B) one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all
substantial decisions of the trust.

     As long as the Company qualifies as a REIT, distributions made to the
Company's taxable U.S. Stockholders out of current or accumulated earnings and
profits (and not designated as capital gain dividends) will be taken into
account by such U.S. Stockholders as ordinary income and will not be eligible
for the dividends received deduction generally available to corporations.
Distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as a
capital gain (to the extent such distributions do not exceed the Company's
actual net capital gain for the taxable year) without regard to the period for
which the stockholder has held its shares. The tax rates applicable to such
capital gains are discussed below. Distributions in excess of current and
accumulated earnings and profits will not be

                                       24

<PAGE>

taxable to a stockholder to the extent that they do not exceed the adjusted
basis of the stockholder's shares, but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of
such shares. To the extent that distributions in excess of current and
accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a stockholder's
shares, such distributions will be included in income as capital gains assuming
the shares are capital assets in the hands of the stockholder. The tax rate
applicable to such capital gain will depend on the stockholder's holding period
for the shares. In addition, any distribution declared by the Company in
October, November or December of any year and payable to a stockholder of record
on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by the
Company and received by the stockholder on December 31 of such year, provided
that the distribution is actually paid by the Company during January of the
following calendar year.

     If the Company should become a closely held REIT, any person owning at
least 10% (by vote or value) of the Company is required to accelerate the
recognition of year-end dividends attributable to the Company, for purposes of
such person's estimated tax payments. A closely held REIT is defined as one in
which at least 50% (by vote or value) is owned by five or fewer persons.
Attribution rules apply to determine ownership.

     The Company may elect to treat all or a part of its undistributed net
capital gain as if it had been distributed to its stockholders (including for
purposes of the 4% excise tax discussed above under "Requirements for
Qualification--Annual Distribution Requirements"). If the Company should make
such an election, the Company's stockholders would be required to include in
their income as long-term capital gain their proportionate share of the
Company's undistributed net capital gain, as designated by the Company. Each
such stockholder would be deemed to have paid its proportionate share of the
income tax imposed on the Company with respect to such undistributed net capital
gain, and this amount would be credited or refunded to the stockholder. In
addition, the tax basis of the stockholder's shares would be increased by its
proportionate share of undistributed net capital gains included in its income,
less its proportionate share of the income tax imposed on the Company with
respect to such gains.

     Stockholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any net
operating losses or capital losses of the Company. Instead, such losses would be
carried over by the Company for potential offset against its future income
(subject to certain limitations). Taxable distributions from the Company and
gain from the disposition of the Common Stock will not be treated as passive
activity income and, therefore, stockholders generally will not be able to apply
any "passive activity losses" (such as losses from certain types of limited
partnerships in which the stockholder is a limited partner) against such income.
In addition, taxable distributions from the Company generally will be treated as
investment income for purposes of the investment interest limitations. Capital
gains from the disposition of the shares (or distributions treated as such) will
be treated as investment income only if the stockholder so elects, in which case
such capital gains will be taxed at ordinary income rates. The Company will
notify stockholders after the close of the Company's taxable year as to the
portions of the distributions attributable to that year that constitute ordinary
income, return of capital and capital gain.

     In general, any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of the
Common Stock by a stockholder who is not a dealer in securities will be treated
as capital gain or loss. Lower marginal tax rates for individuals may apply in
the case of capital gains, depending on the holding period of the shares that
are sold. However, any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares by a stockholder
who has held such shares for six months or less (after applying certain holding
period rules) will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of
distributions from the Company required to be treated by such stockholder as
long-term capital gain. All or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable
disposition of shares may be disallowed if other shares are purchased within 30
days before or after the disposition.

     For non-corporate taxpayers, the tax rate differential between capital gain
and ordinary income may be significant. The highest marginal individual income
tax rate applicable to ordinary income is 39.1% for 2001. Any capital gain
generally will be taxed to a non-corporate taxpayer at a maximum rate of 20%
with respect to capital assets held for more than one year. The tax rates
applicable to ordinary income apply to gain attributable to the sale or exchange
of capital assets held for one year or less. In the case of capital gain
attributable to the sale or exchange of certain real property held for more than
one year, an amount of such gain equal to the amount of all prior depreciation
deductions not otherwise required to be taxed as ordinary depreciation recapture
income will be taxed at a maximum rate of 25%. With respect to distributions
designated by a REIT as capital gain dividends (including deemed distributions
of retained capital gains), the REIT also may designate (subject to certain
limits) whether the dividend is taxable to non-corporate stockholders as a 20%
rate gain distribution or an unrecaptured depreciation distribution taxed at a
25% rate.

     The characterization of income as capital or ordinary may affect the
deductibility of capital losses. Capital losses not offset by capital gains may
be deducted against a non-corporate taxpayer's ordinary income only up to a
maximum annual amount of $3,000. Non-corporate taxpayers may carry forward their
unused capital losses. All net capital gain of a corporate taxpayer is subject
to tax at ordinary corporate rates. A corporate taxpayer can deduct

                                       25

<PAGE>

capital losses only to the extent of capital gains, with unused losses being
carried back three years and forward five years.

Treatment of Tax-Exempt Stockholders

     Tax-exempt organizations, including qualified employee pension and profit
sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts (collectively, "Exempt
Organizations"), generally are exempt from federal income taxation. However,
they are subject to taxation on their UBTI. While many investments in real
estate generate UBTI, the IRS has issued a published ruling that dividend
distributions by a REIT to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute
UBTI, provided that the shares of the REIT are not otherwise used in an
unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust. Based on that
ruling, and subject to the exceptions discussed below, amounts distributed by
the Company to Exempt Organizations generally should not constitute UBTI.
However, if an Exempt Organization finances its acquisition of the Common Stock
with debt, a portion of its income from the Company will constitute UBTI
pursuant to the "debt-financed property" rules. Furthermore, social clubs,
voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit
trusts and qualified group legal services plans that are exempt from taxation
under paragraphs (7), (9), (17) and (20), respectively, of Section 501(c) of the
Code are subject to different UBTI rules, which generally will require them to
characterize distributions from the Company as UBTI. In addition, in certain
circumstances, a pension trust that owns more than 10% of the Company's stock is
required to treat a percentage of the dividends from the Company as UBTI (the
"UBTI Percentage"). The UBTI Percentage is the gross income, less related direct
expenses, derived by the Company from an unrelated trade or business (determined
as if the Company were a pension trust) divided by the gross income, less
related direct expenses, of the Company for the year in which the dividends are
paid. The UBTI rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10% of the
Company's stock only if (i) the UBTI Percentage is at least 5%, (ii) the Company
qualifies as a REIT by reason of the modification of the 5/50 Rule that allows
the beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares of the
Company in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and
(iii) either (A) one pension trust owns more than 25% of the value of the
Company's stock or (B) a group of pension trusts individually holding more than
10% of the value of the Company's stock collectively own more than 50% of the
value of the Company's stock.

Special Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Stockholders

     The rules governing U.S. federal income taxation of nonresident alien
individuals, foreign corporations, foreign partnerships and other foreign
stockholders (collectively, "Non-U.S. Stockholders") are complex, and no attempt
will be made herein to provide more than a summary of such rules. Non-U.S.
stockholders should consult with their own tax advisors to determine the impact
of federal, state and local income tax laws with regard to their ownership of
the Common Stock, including any reporting requirements.

     For purposes of this discussion, the term "Non-U.S. Stockholder" does not
include any foreign stockholder whose investment in the Company's stock is
"effectively connected" with the conduct of a trade or business in the United
States. Such a foreign stockholder, in general, will be subject to United States
federal income tax with respect to its investment in the Company's stock in the
same manner as a U.S. Stockholder is taxed (subject to applicable alternative
minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident
alien individuals). In addition, a foreign corporation receiving income that is
treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business also may be
subject to an additional 30% "branch profits tax," unless an applicable tax
treaty provides a lower rate or an exemption. Certain certification requirements
must be satisfied in order for effectively connected income to be exempt from
withholding.

     Distributions to Non-U.S. Stockholders that are not attributable to gain
from sales or exchanges by the Company of U.S. real property interests and are
not designated by the Company as capital gain dividends (or deemed distributions
of retained capital gains) will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to
the extent that they are made out of current or accumulated earnings and profits
of the Company. Such distributions ordinarily will be subject to a withholding
tax equal to 30% of the gross amount of the distribution unless an applicable
tax treaty reduces or eliminates that tax. Distributions in excess of current
and accumulated earnings and profits of the Company will not be taxable to a
stockholder to the extent that such distributions do not exceed the adjusted
basis of the stockholder's shares, but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of
such shares. To the extent that distributions in excess of current and
accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a Non-U.S.
Stockholder's shares, such distributions will give rise to tax liability if the
Non-U.S. Stockholder would otherwise be subject to tax on any gain from the sale
or disposition of its shares, as described below.

     For any year in which the Company qualifies as a REIT, distributions that
are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by the Company of U.S. real
property interests will be taxed to a Non-U.S. Stockholder under the provisions
of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 ("FIRPTA"). Under
FIRPTA, distributions

                                       26

<PAGE>

attributable to gain from sales of U.S. real property interests are taxed to a
Non-U.S. Stockholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S.
business. Non-U.S. Stockholders thus would be taxed at the normal capital gain
rates applicable to U.S. Stockholders (subject to applicable alternative minimum
tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien
individuals). Distributions subject to FIRPTA also may be subject to 30% branch
profits tax in the hands of a foreign corporate stockholder not entitled to
treaty relief or exemption.

     Unless a reduced rate of withholding applies under an applicable tax
treaty, the Company generally will withhold from distributions to Non-U.S.
Stockholders, and remit to the IRS, 30% of all distributions out of current or
accumulated earnings and profits, subject to the application of FIRPTA
withholding rules discussed below. In addition, the Company is required to
withhold 10% of any distribution in excess of its current and accumulated
earnings and profits. Because the Company generally cannot determine at the time
a distribution is made whether or not it will be in excess of earnings and
profits, the Company intends to withhold 30% of the entire amount of any
distribution (other than distributions subject to the 35% withholding discussed
below). Generally, however, a Non-U.S. Stockholder will be entitled to a refund
from the IRS to the extent an amount is withheld from a distribution that
exceeds the amount of U.S. tax owed by such Non-U.S. Stockholder.

     Under FIRPTA, the Company is required to withhold 35% of any distribution
that is designated as a capital gain dividend or which could be designated as a
capital gain dividend. Thus, if the Company designates previously made
distributions as capital gain dividends, subsequent distributions (up to the
amount of such prior distributions) will be treated as capital gain dividends
for purposes of FIRPTA withholding.

     Under Regulations that are currently in effect, dividends paid to an
address in a country outside the United States generally are presumed to be paid
to a resident of such country for purposes of determining the applicability of
withholding discussed above and the applicability of a tax treaty rate.
Regulations issued in October 1997, however, provide that a Non-U.S. Stockholder
who wishes to claim the benefit of an applicable treaty rate must satisfy
certain certification and other requirements. Such Regulations generally will be
effective for distributions made after December 31, 2000.

     For so long as the Common Stock continues to be regularly traded on an
established securities market, the sale of such stock by any Non-U.S.
Stockholder who is not a Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder (as defined below)
generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax (unless the
Non-U.S. Stockholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the
United States for more than 182 days during the taxable year of the sale and
certain other conditions apply, in which case such gain will be subject to a 30%
tax on a gross basis). A "Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder" is a Non-U.S.
Stockholder who, at some time during the five-year period preceding such sale or
disposition, beneficially owned (including under certain attribution rules) more
than 5% of the total fair market value of the Common Stock (as outstanding from
time to time) or owned shares of another class of stock of the Company that
represented value greater than 5% of the Common Stock (measured at the time such
shares were acquired).

     In general, the sale or other taxable disposition of the Common Stock by a
Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder (as defined below) also will not be subject to
United States federal income tax if the Company is a "domestically controlled
REIT." A REIT is a "domestically controlled REIT" if, at all times during the
five-year period preceding the relevant testing date, less than 50% in value of
its shares is held directly or indirectly by Non-U.S. Stockholders (taking into
account those persons required to include the Company's dividends in income for
United States federal income tax purposes). Although the Company believes that
it currently qualifies as a "domestically controlled REIT," because the Common
Stock is publicly traded, no assurance can be given that the Company will
qualify as a domestically controlled REIT at any time in the future. If the
Company does not constitute a domestically controlled REIT, a Five Percent
Non-U.S. Stockholder will be taxable in the same manner as a U.S. Stockholder
with respect to gain on the sale of the Common Stock (subject to applicable
alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of
nonresident alien individuals).

Information Reporting Requirements and Backup Withholding Tax

     The Company will report to its U.S. Stockholders and to the IRS the amount
of distributions paid during each calendar year and distributions required to be
treated as so paid during a calendar year, and the amount of tax withheld, if
any. Under the backup withholding rules, a stockholder may be subject to backup
withholding at the applicable rate (30% beginning January 1, 2002) with respect
to distributions paid unless such holder (i) is a corporation or comes within
certain other exempt categories and, when required, demonstrates this fact or
(ii) provides a taxpayer identification number, certifies as to no loss of
exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable
requirements of the backup withholding rules. A stockholder who does not provide
the Company with its correct taxpayer identification number also may be subject
to penalties imposed by the IRS. In addition, the Company may be required to
withhold a portion of capital gain distributions to any

                                       27

<PAGE>

stockholders who fail to certify their non-foreign status to the Company.

     U.S. Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their
qualifications for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for
obtaining such an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax.
Rather, the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a U.S.
Stockholder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Stockholder's United
States federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Stockholder to a
refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS.

     Backup withholding tax and information reporting generally will not apply
to distributions paid to Non-U.S. Stockholders outside the United States that
are treated as (i) dividends subject to the 30% (or lower treaty rate)
withholding tax discussed above, (ii) capital gain dividends or (iii)
distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by the Company of
U.S. real property interests. As a general matter, backup withholding and
information reporting will not apply to a payment of the proceeds of a sale of
the Common Stock by or through a foreign office of a foreign broker. Information
reporting (but not backup withholding) will apply, however, to a payment of the
proceeds of a sale of the Common Stock by a foreign office of a broker that (i)
is a United States person, (ii) derives 50% or more of its gross income for
certain periods from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or
(iii) is a "controlled foreign corporation" for United States tax purposes,
unless the broker has documentary evidence in its records that the holder is a
Non-U.S. Stockholder and certain other conditions are satisfied, or the
stockholder otherwise establishes an exemption. Payment to or through a United
States office of a broker of the proceeds of a sale of the Common Stock is
subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the
stockholder certifies under penalties of perjury that the stockholder is a
Non-U.S. Stockholder or otherwise establishes an exemption. A Non-U.S.
Stockholder may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS.

     The final Regulations issued by the Treasury Department in 1997, as
corrected in 2000 and 2001 became effective January 1, 2001. In addition, the
Treasury Department issued Temporary Regulations in January 2002, which together
with the final Regulations govern the withholding of tax and information
reporting for certain amounts paid to non-resident alien individuals and foreign
corporations. Stockholders should consult their tax advisors concerning the
impact, if any, of these new Regulations on their ownership of shares of the
Common Stock.

Other Tax Considerations

     The Company and its stockholders may be subject to state and local tax in
states and localities in which they do business or own property. The tax
treatment of the Company and the stockholders in such jurisdictions may differ
from the federal income tax treatment described above. Consequently,
stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state
and local tax laws on their ownership of shares of the Common Stock.

Employees

     As of December 31, 2001, the Company had nine (9) full-time employees and
five (5) part-time employees. The Company considers its relationship with its
employees to be good.

Insurance

     The Company maintains and/or requires in its leases that its tenants
maintain appropriate liability and casualty insurance on its assets and
operations. Under the Master Leases, Kindred is required to maintain, at its
expense, certain insurance coverage related to the properties under the Master
Leases and Kindred's operations at the related facilities. See "--Recent
Developments Regarding Kindred--Master Leases." There can be no assurance that
Kindred and the Company's other tenants will maintain such insurance and any
failure by Kindred or the Company's other tenants to do so could have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company believes that Kindred and its other
tenants are in substantial compliance with the insurance requirements contained
in their respective leases with the Company.

     The Company believes that the amount and coverage of its insurance
protection is customary for similarly situated companies in its industry. There
can be no assurance that in the future such insurance will be available at a
reasonable price or that the Company will be able to maintain adequate levels of
insurance coverage.

                                       28

<PAGE>

                                  RISK FACTORS

     BECAUSE KINDRED IS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF THE COMPANY'S RENTAL REVENUES,
KINDRED'S INABILITY OR UNWILLINGNESS TO SATISFY ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE MASTER
LEASES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

     The Company leases substantially all its properties to Kindred and,
therefore, Kindred is the primary source of the Company's rental revenues,
accounting for approximately 98.8% of its rental revenues in 2001. Accordingly,
Kindred's financial condition and ability to meet its rent obligations will
determine the Company's rental revenues and its ability to make distributions to
its stockholders. In addition, any failure by Kindred to effectively conduct its
operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on
its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities. Kindred, as well
as certain other tenants of the Company, have experienced financial difficulty
and/or filed for bankruptcy. Kindred emerged from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001.
Despite Kindred's emergence from bankruptcy, there can be no assurance that
Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it
to satisfy its obligations under the Master Leases. Since the Company derives in
excess of 98% of its rental revenues from Kindred and since the Master Leases
are triple-net leases under which Kindred is responsible for all insurance,
taxes, utilities, maintenance and repair expenses required in connection with
the leased properties, the inability or unwillingness of Kindred to satisfy its
obligations under the Master Leases could have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

     DUE TO THE COMPANY'S DEPENDENCE ON KINDRED'S RENTAL PAYMENTS AS THE PRIMARY
SOURCE OF ITS RENTAL REVENUES, THE COMPANY MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY
ENFORCING ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE MASTER LEASES OR BY TERMINATING A MASTER LEASE.

     If Kindred fails to comply with the terms of the Master Leases or to comply
with applicable healthcare regulations and, in either case, Kindred or its
lenders fail to cure such default within the specified cure period, the Company
may have to find another lessee/operator for the properties covered by one or
all of the Master Leases. During any period that the Company is attempting to
locate one or more lessee/operators there could be a decrease or cessation of
rental payments by Kindred. There can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to locate another suitable lessee/operator or that if the Company is
successful in locating such an operator, that the rental payments from the new
operator would not be significantly less than the existing rental payments. The
Company's ability to locate another suitable lessee/operator may be
significantly delayed or limited by various state licensing, receivership,
certificate-of-need or other laws, as well as by Medicare and Medicaid change of
ownership rules. See "Business--Governmental Regulation."

     KINDRED MAY NOT PERFORM THE OBLIGATIONS IT ASSUMED IN THE 1998 SPIN OFF
RELATING TO INDEMNIFICATION OF THE COMPANY AND THE ASSUMPTION OF THE DEFENSE OF
CERTAIN CLAIMS.

     In connection with the 1998 Spin Off, Kindred assumed and agreed to
indemnify the Company for all obligations under third party leases and contracts
and for all losses, including costs and expenses, resulting from future claims
and all liabilities that may arise out of the ownership or operation of the
healthcare operations either before or after the date of the 1998 Spin Off. At
that time, Kindred also agreed to assume the defense, on the Company's behalf,
of any claims that were pending at the time of the 1998 Spin Off and that arose
out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations or were asserted
after the 1998 Spin Off and that arise out of the ownership and operation of the
healthcare operations or any of the assets or liabilities transferred to Kindred
in connection with the 1998 Spin Off. Kindred also agreed to indemnify the
Company for any fees, costs, expenses and liabilities arising out of these
obligations and operations. There can be no assurance that Kindred will have
sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its
obligations incurred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off or that Kindred will
continue to honor its obligations incurred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off.
If Kindred does not satisfy or otherwise honor the obligations under these
arrangements, then the Company may be liable for the payment or performance of
certain of such obligations and may have to assume the defense of such claims.
The failure of Kindred to perform these obligations could have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

     ANY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE 1,080,314 SHARES OF KINDRED
COMMON STOCK THAT THE COMPANY OWNS, AS WELL AS THE LIMITATIONS ON THE COMPANY'S
ABILITY TO SELL, TRANSFER OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF SUCH SHARES OF KINDRED COMMON
STOCK, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO REDUCE
ITS INDEBTEDNESS AND IMPLEMENT ITS BUSINESS STRATEGY.

     The Company intends to apply its Kindred common stock to the satisfaction
of certain financial obligations of the Company. If the value of the Kindred
common stock decreases, the Company would have to use other

                                       29

<PAGE>

consideration, including cash on hand, to satisfy such financial obligations
thereby impairing the Company's ability to reduce its indebtedness and implement
it business strategy. In addition, the Company's ability to sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of the Kindred common stock is subject to compliance with
certain laws, rules and regulations of the Commission and the New York Stock
Exchange and certain restrictions contained in the Registration Rights
Agreement. To the extent such legal and contractual restrictions limit the
Company's ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Kindred common
stock, the Company would have to find other consideration to satisfy any
obligation the Company may intend to satisfy with the Kindred common stock. In
either case, were the Company required to use cash on hand, this may impact the
Company's ability to reduce its indebtedness, implement its business strategy
and meet its debt service and other obligations. For additional information on
the risks relating to the Kindred common stock, please see our risk factors
relating to (a) jeopardizing our REIT status due to the value of the Kindred
common stock and (b) not having sufficient cash to meet the REIT distribution
requirements.

     THE COMPANY IS SIGNIFICANTLY LEVERAGED, AND IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES THE
COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CREDIT OR RAISE EQUITY IN ORDER
TO MEET THE COMPANY'S DEBT PAYMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE UNITED STATES
SETTLEMENT. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WOULD BE ABLE TO
OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CREDIT OR RAISE EQUITY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE OR THAT THE
COMPANY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO ON TERMS THAT THE COMPANY FINDS ACCEPTABLE.

     The Company is significantly leveraged and a substantial portion of its
cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest
on indebtedness and the obligations under the United States Settlement. The
Company depends on lease payments from Kindred to meet its interest expense and
principal repayment obligations under the Company's debt facilities and the
Company's obligations under the United States Settlement. If the Company's cash
flow from operations is not sufficient to meet these payments and obligations,
the Company would be required to obtain additional borrowings or raise equity to
meet them. The Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness is restricted
by the terms of the Credit Agreement. In addition, adverse economic conditions
could cause the terms on which the Company can obtain additional borrowings to
become unfavorable. In such circumstances, the Company may be required to raise
equity in the capital markets or liquidate one or more investments in properties
at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on the
investments and that could result in adverse tax consequences to the Company. In
addition, certain healthcare regulations may constrain the Company's ability to
sell assets. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to meet its
debt service obligations or its obligations under the United States Settlement
and the failure to do so could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

     THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY OF KINDRED, AS A TRIPLE-NET TENANT
UNDER THE MASTER LEASES, AND ITS OTHER TENANTS TO MANAGE AND MAINTAIN THE
COMPANY'S LEASED PROPERTIES.

     The Company may be unable to take action if it believes Kindred or one of
its other tenants are operating one of the Company's leased properties
inefficiently or in a manner adverse to its interests. The failure of Kindred to
make three consecutive rent payments will trigger an event of default under the
Company's Credit Agreement. If there is an event of default under a Master Lease
and the Company repossesses the property or property under a Master Lease is
otherwise returned to the Company, it would have to locate a suitable
tenant/operator for the property. There can be no assurance that the Company
will be able to locate another suitable tenant/operator or that if the Company
is successful in locating such an operator, that the rental payments from the
new operator would not be significantly less than the existing rental payments.
In addition, the Company's ability to locate another suitable tenant/operator
may be significantly delayed or limited by various state licensing,
receivership, certificate-of-need or other laws, as well as Medicare and
Medicaid change of ownership rules.

     THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENT IN A SINGLE
INDUSTRY.

     The Company's strategy is to invest solely in healthcare-related
properties. As a result, the Company has not diversified its investments beyond
the healthcare industry and is subject to the risks of investing in a single
industry. Moreover, the Company's ability to invest in nonhealthcare-related
properties is restricted by the terms of the Credit Agreement.

     The ability of Kindred and the Company's other tenants and operators to
generate profits and pay rent under their leases may be adversely affected by
the risks associated with the heavily regulated healthcare industry.

     Because all of its properties are used as healthcare facilities, the
Company is directly affected by the risks associated with the healthcare
industry. The ability of Kindred and the Company's other tenants and operators
to generate profits and pay rent under their leases may be adversely impacted by
such risks. See "Business--Governmental Regulation."

                                       30

     In the ordinary course of their businesses, Kindred and the Company's other
tenants and operators are subject regularly to inquiries, investigations and
audits by federal and state agencies that oversee compliance with statutory and
regulatory healthcare requirements. The extensive federal, state and local
requirements affecting the healthcare industry include, but are not limited to,
statutory and regulatory provisions relating to licensure, conduct of
operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities, allowable costs,
patient care and other services and charges for services. See
"Business--Governmental Regulation." In particular, various laws including,
antikickback, antifraud and abuse laws, prohibit certain business practices and
relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services
reimbursable under Medicare and Medicaid, including the payment or receipt of
remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid for by
Medicare or other governmental programs. The sanctions and penalties for
violating these laws include criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including
fines and possible exclusion from federal and state government programs,
including Medicare and Medicaid.

     The Company believes that the regulatory environment surrounding the
long-term care industry has intensified, particularly for large for-profit,
multi-facility providers like Kindred. The federal government has imposed
intensive enforcement policies resulting in a significant increase in the number
of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and imposed regulatory
sanctions, including terminations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and
civil monetary penalties. The operators of our facilities receive notices of
potential sanctions and remedies from time to time, and such sanctions have been
imposed on some of our facilities from time to time. If Kindred and the
Company's other tenants and operators fail to comply with the extensive laws and
regulations applicable to their businesses, they could become ineligible to
receive government program reimbursement, suffer civil or criminal penalties or
be required to make significant changes to their operations. In addition, they
could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation
or other enforcement action under these laws and regulations. Any of these
results could make it difficult or impossible for them to meet their financial
and other obligations to the Company.

     As part of the United States Settlement, Kindred entered into and agreed to
comply with the terms of a Corporate Integrity Agreement. The Corporate
Integrity Agreement became effective on the Kindred Effective Date. Kindred's
failure to comply with the Corporate Integrity Agreement could have a material
adverse effect on Kindred's results of operations, financial condition and its
ability to make rental payments to the Company, which, in turn, could have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

     The Company is unable to predict the future course of federal, state and
local regulation or legislation, including the Medicare and Medicaid statutes
and regulations. Changes in the regulatory framework could have a material
adverse effect on Kindred and the Company's other operators' results of
operations, financial condition, and their ability to make rental payments to
the Company, which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. See "Business--Government Regulation."

     THE ABILITY OF KINDRED AND THE COMPANY'S OTHER TENANTS AND OPERATORS TO
GENERATE PROFITS AND PAY RENT UNDER THEIR LEASES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY
CHANGES IN THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES OR METHODS OF PAYMENT FROM THIRD-PARTY
PAYORS, INCLUDING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS.

     Kindred and the Company's other tenants and operators rely on reimbursement
from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, for
substantially all of their revenues. Healthcare in the United States continues
to attract much legislative interest and public attention. In an effort to
reduce federal spending on healthcare, in 1997 the Federal government enacted
the Budget Act, which contained extensive changes to the Medicare and Medicaid
programs intended to reduce the projected amount of increase in payments under
such programs between 1998 and 2002. Virtually all spending reductions pursuant
to the Budget Act have and will reduce payments to healthcare providers, such as
our operators. For certain healthcare providers, including hospitals, home
health agencies, SNFs and hospices, implementation of the Budget Act has
resulted in more drastic reimbursement reductions than had been anticipated. In
addition to its impact on Medicare, the Budget Act also afforded states more
flexibility in administering their Medicaid plans, including the ability to
transfer most Medicaid enrollees into managed care plans without first obtaining
a federal waiver. Moreover, by repealing the Boren Amendment, the Budget Act
eased impediments on the states' ability to reduce their Medicaid reimbursement
levels. Accordingly, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including payment
levels and methods, are in a state of change and are less predictable than
before enactment of the Budget Act. See "Business--Governmental
Regulation--Healthcare Reform."

     Certain temporary Medicare reimbursement increases to SNFs provided under
the Refinement Act and BIPA expire on September 30, 2002. Expiring provisions
are estimated to, on average, reduce per beneficiary Medicare per diem rates by
$57. Moreover, CMS has informally indicated that it intends to complete
refinements to the SNF PPS as part of the upcoming fiscal year 2003 rulemaking.
Under applicable law, when these revisions are

                                       31

<PAGE>

implemented, the givebacks under the Refinement Act and BIPA will expire. There
can be no assurance that the giveback provisions under the Refinement Act and
BIPA will continue after September 30, 2002.

     With respect to LTACs, BIPA mandated that HHS implement a Medicare LTAC PPS
by October 1, 2002. Unless the Secretary of HHS develops a methodology
specifically refined for LTACs before that date, the LTAC PPS will be
implemented using the DRGs currently used for inpatient stays in acute care
hospitals (modified, if feasible, to account for the resource usage of long-term
care patients, as well as the most recently available hospital discharge data).
On March 22, 2002, CMS published a proposed rule for LTAC PPS. The Company is
currently analyzing the proposed rule. The public will have 60 days from March
22, 2002 to review the proposed rule and submit comments. In response to
comments submitted by the public and its own ongoing review of the proposed
rule, CMS may modify the proposed rule before it is adopted in final form. There
can be no assurance as to the content of the final rule for LTAC PPS, nor can we
predict its impact on the Company's tenants and operators. The Company believes
that the new prospective payment system would impact Kindred no sooner than
September 1, 2003.

     There also continue to be state legislative proposals that would impose
more limitations on government and private payments to providers of healthcare
services such as Kindred. Due in part to anticipated budget short-falls, many
states have enacted or are considering enacting measures that are designed to
reduce their Medicaid expenditures and to make certain changes to private
healthcare insurance. Some states also are considering regulatory changes that
include a moratorium on the designation of additional LTACs. There are a number
of legislative proposals currently under consideration, including payment limits
or caps and the establishment of Medicaid prospective payment systems for
nursing facilities.

     There continues to be various legislative and regulatory proposals to
implement cost-containment measures that limit payments to healthcare providers.
In addition, private third-party payors have continued their efforts to control
healthcare costs. There can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels
will continue to be available for services to be provided by Kindred and other
tenants which are currently being reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or private
payors. Significant limits by the governmental and third-party payors on the
scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a
material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of
operations of Kindred and the Company's operators and other tenants, which, in
turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

     For more information, See "Business--Government Regulation."

     SIGNIFICANT LEGAL ACTIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA, COULD
SUBJECT KINDRED TO INCREASED OPERATING COSTS AND SUBSTANTIAL UNINSURED
LIABILITIES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT KINDRED'S LIQUIDITY,
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.

     Kindred has experienced substantial increases in both the number and size
of patient care liability claims in recent years. In addition to large
compensatory claims, plaintiffs' attorneys increasingly are seeking significant
punitive damages and attorneys fees. In the State of Florida, where Kindred
operates 15 of the Company's nursing centers and six of the Company's hospitals,
general liability and professional liability costs for nursing centers have
increased substantially and become increasingly difficult to estimate.

     Kindred insures its professional liability risks in part through a
wholly-owned, limited purpose insurance company. The limited purpose insurance
company insures initial losses up to specified coverage levels per occurrence
and in the aggregate. Coverage for losses in excess of those levels are
maintained through unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers. Effective
November 30, 2000, the limited purpose insurance company insures all claims
arising in Florida up to a per occurrence limit without the benefit of any
aggregate coverage limit through unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers.
Kindred maintains general liability insurance and professional malpractice
liability insurance in amounts and with deductibles which Kindred management has
indicated that it believes are sufficient for its operations. However, its
insurance coverage might not cover all claims against Kindred or continue to be
available to Kindred at a reasonable cost. If Kindred is unable to maintain
adequate insurance coverage or is required to pay punitive damages, Kindred may
be exposed to substantial liabilities.

     Kindred may also be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to
combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These lawsuits can involve
significant monetary and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully
bring these suits. These lawsuits brought against Kindred combined with
increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a
material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of
operation of Kindred and its ability to make rental payments to the Company,
which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

     THE COMPANY MAY ENCOUNTER CERTAIN RISKS AND FINANCING CONSTRAINTS WHEN
IMPLEMENTING THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS STRATEGY.

     At the time of the 1998 Spin Off, the Company's business strategy was to
diversify the Company from the Kindred tenant concentration. As a result of the
Kindred bankruptcy proceedings, the Company suspended the

                                       32

<PAGE>

implementation of its original business strategy in 1999 and continued such
suspension through 2001. The Company's current business strategy is preserving
and maximizing stockholders' capital by means that include (a) the reduction of
the amount of the Company's indebtedness and a reduction of the average all-in
cost of the Company's indebtedness and (b) the implementation of a measured and
disciplined diversification and growth program to reduce the Company's
dependence on Kindred. The ability of the Company to pursue certain of these
objectives may be restricted by the terms of the Credit Agreement.

     If the Company pursues acquisitions or development of additional healthcare
or other properties, the Company may encounter certain risks and financing
constraints. Acquisitions entail general investment risk associated with any
real estate investments, including risks that investments will fail to perform
in accordance with expectations, the estimates of the cost of improvements
necessary for acquired properties will prove inaccurate, and the inability of
the tenant/operator to meet performance expectations. The Company does not
presently contemplate any development projects, although if the Company were to
pursue new development projects, such projects would be subject to numerous
risks, including risks of construction delays or cost overruns that may increase
project costs, new project commencement risks such as receipt of zoning,
occupancy and other required governmental approvals and permits and the
incurrence of development costs in connection with projects that are not pursued
to completion. The fact that the Company must distribute 90% of its net taxable
income in order to maintain qualification as a REIT may limit the Company's
ability to rely upon rental payments from its properties or subsequently
acquired properties to finance acquisitions or new developments. As a result, if
debt or equity financing is not available on acceptable terms, further
acquisitions or development activities might be curtailed or cash available for
distribution would be adversely impaired.

     The Company will compete for investment opportunities with certain entities
that may have substantially greater financial resources. The Company's ability
to compete successfully for such opportunities is affected by many factors,
including the cost to the Company of obtaining debt and equity capital at rates
comparable to or better than its competitors. Competition generally may reduce
the number of suitable investment opportunities available to the Company and
increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby
impeding the implementation of the Company's business strategy.

     THE COMPANY MAY JEOPARDIZE ITS REIT STATUS IF IT VIOLATES THE 10%
SECURITIES TEST OR THE 5% ASSET TEST BECAUSE OF THE VALUE OF THE KINDRED COMMON
STOCK.

     The Company leases substantially all of its properties to Kindred and
Kindred is the primary source of the Company's rental revenues. Under the
Kindred Reorganization Plan, the Company received 1,498,500 shares of Kindred
common stock on April 20, 2001 as future rent. The Company sold 83,300 of those
shares of Kindred common stock on November 14, 2001 through an underwritten
offering, and distributed 334,886 shares of Kindred common stock as part of the
2001 dividend. Consequently, the Company currently owns 1,080,314 shares of
Kindred common stock. If the Company violated or violates the 10% securities
test, Kindred would be a related party tenant and consequently, the rents from
Kindred would not qualify as "rents from real property" under the Code. As a
result, the Company would lose its REIT status because the Company likely would
not be able to satisfy either the 75% or the 95% gross income test. See
"Business-- Federal Income Tax Considerations."

     In addition, if the value of the Company's shares of Kindred common stock
exceeds 5% of the value of the Company's total assets at the end of the quarter
in which the Company received the Kindred common stock or at the end of any
subsequent quarter (except where such excess in subsequent quarters is caused by
value fluctuations of the Company's various investments and not by the
acquisition or disposition of assets) the Company would violate the 5% asset
test. Consequently, the Company would lose its REIT status unless it timely
cured the violation under the applicable provisions of the Code. There can be no
assurance that relief for such a violation would be available. See "Business--
Federal Income Tax Considerations."

     THE COMPANY MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH OR OTHER LIQUID ASSETS TO MEET THE
90% DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT BECAUSE OF TIMING ISSUES AND OTHER CASH NEEDS AND
MAY THEREFORE NEED TO ENGAGE IN SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ITS
REIT QUALIFICATION.

     To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to
avoid the nondeductible excise tax, the Company must make distributions to its
stockholders. Although the Company anticipates that it generally will have
sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable it to satisfy the distribution
requirement, it is possible that from time to time, the Company may not have
sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement
or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and
excise taxation. This may be due to the timing differences between the actual
receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and
the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at the
Company's taxable income. In addition, nondeductible expenses such as principal
amortization or repayments or

                                       33

<PAGE>

capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions may also cause the Company
to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable it to satisfy the 90%
distribution requirement.

     In the event that timing differences or other cash needs occur, the Company
may find it necessary to borrow funds, issue equity securities (although there
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so), pay taxable stock
dividends if possible, distribute other property or securities (including
Kindred common stock) or engage in a transaction intended to enable the Company
to meet the REIT distribution requirements. The terms of the Credit Agreement
restrict the Company's ability to engage in some of these transactions. In
addition, any of these transactions would likely require the consent of the
required lenders under the Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that the
Company can obtain the consent of the required lenders. In addition, the failure
of Kindred to make rental payments under the Master Leases would impair
significantly the Company's ability to make distributions. The registration
requirements under the Securities Act, the rules and regulations of the New York
Stock Exchange and the Commission and other applicable laws, rules and
regulations also restrict the ability of the Company to engage in some of these
transactions. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to make distributions at the required distribution rate or any other rate.
Although the Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT for the year
ending December 31, 2002 and subsequent years, it is possible that economic,
market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause the Company to fail, or
elect not, to continue to qualify as a REIT.

     EVEN THOUGH ATRIA, INC. ("ATRIA") HAS ASSUMED AND AGREED TO REPAY
INDEBTEDNESS EVIDENCED BY BONDS THAT THE COMPANY ISSUED UNDER THE SPIN OFF OF
THE COMPANY'S ASSISTED LIVING OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY MAY STILL BE LIABLE FOR
THE INDEBTEDNESS IF ATRIA CANNOT OR DOES NOT HONOR ITS OBLIGATIONS.

     The Company has issued bonds to residents of an assisted living facility
that is owned by the Company, and leased to and operated by Atria. Proceeds from
the bonds are paid to and utilized by Atria. The obligation to repay the bonds
is secured by a mortgage and trust indenture that encumbers (among other
property) the assisted living facility. Currently, based solely upon information
obtained from Atria, the bonds evidence an aggregate principal amount of
indebtedness of approximately $29.4 million. In connection with the Company's
spin off of its assisted living operations and related assets and liabilities to
Atria in 1996, Atria assumed and agreed to repay the indebtedness and to
indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and against all amounts the Company
may be obligated to pay under the mortgage and trust indenture, including the
obligation to repay the bonds. The Company may remain the primary obligor under
the bonds and the mortgage and trust indenture. If Atria is unable to or does
not satisfy these obligations, the Company may be liable for these obligations.
There can be no assurance that Atria will have sufficient means to enable it to
satisfy its obligations or will continue to honor those obligations under the
mortgage and trust indenture and the bonds. However, the Company believes that
Atria's failure to satisfy its obligations would, subject to any applicable
defenses available to Atria, allow the Company to terminate the lease between
Atria and the Company, repossesses the property, and exercise all other
available remedies under the lease between Atria and the Company. The Company's
payment or performance of these obligations could have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. The Company is currently engaged in efforts to have itself
released from liability under the bonds and the mortgage and trust indenture.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its attempts to
be released from this potential liability. A lawsuit is pending against the
Company wherein Atria is seeking, among other things, a declaration that Atria's
indemnity obligation in favor of the Company relative to the bonds is void and
unenforceable. See "Note 12--Litigation--Other Legal Proceedings" to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report, which is
incorporated by reference herein.

     AN UNPAID CREDITOR OR REPRESENTATIVE OF CREDITORS COULD BRING A LAWSUIT
AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGING FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCE OR AN UNLAWFUL DIVIDEND
REGARDING THE 1998 SPIN OFF AND A COURT COULD RULE THAT THE COMPANY HAD VIOLATED
FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCE LAWS.

     The 1998 Spin Off, including the simultaneous distribution of the Kindred
common stock to its stockholders, could be subject to review under various
federal and state laws and could lead to claims being asserted against the
Company, directly or indirectly, alleging that the 1998 Spin Off involved a
fraudulent conveyance, an unlawful dividend, misrepresentation or other conduct
giving rise to liability on the part of the Company. If a court were to conclude
that the 1998 Spin Off was improper or otherwise violated applicable law, it
could, among other things, order that the holders of the stock return the value
of the stock and any dividends paid thereon and invalidate, in whole or in part,
the 1998 Spin Off. The Company believes that the Company and each of its
subsidiaries were generally solvent at the time of the 1998 Spin Off, were able
to repay their debts as they matured following the 1998 Spin Off and had
sufficient capital to carry on their respective businesses. The Company also
believes that the 1998 Spin Off was consummated entirely in compliance with
Delaware law. There can be no assurance that a court would reach the same
conclusions.

                                       34

<PAGE>

     THE COMPANY MAY STILL BE SUBJECT TO CORPORATE LEVEL TAXES.

     Following the Company's REIT election, the Company is considered to be a
former C corporation for income tax purposes. Therefore, potentially, the
Company remains subject to corporate level taxes for any asset dispositions
occurring between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2008. The Internal Revenue
Service is currently reviewing the Company's federal tax returns for tax years
ended December 31, 1997 and 1998 and may also review the Company's federal tax
returns for subsequent years. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate
outcome of these matters or whether that outcome will have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

     However, if there are any resulting tax liabilities for the tax years ended
December 31, 1997 and 1998, the Company intends to use the net operating loss
carryforwards, if any (including the NOL carryforwards that were utilized to
offset its federal income tax liability for 1999 and 2000) to satisfy those tax
liabilities. If the tax liabilities exceed the amount of NOL carryforwards, then
the Company will use the escrowed amounts under the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement
to satisfy the remaining tax liabilities. To the extent that NOL carryforwards
and escrowed amounts are not sufficient to satisfy the tax liabilities, Kindred
has indemnified the Company for specific tax liabilities and Kindred has assumed
these obligations under the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement. There can be no
assurance that the NOL carryforwards and the escrowed amounts will be sufficient
to satisfy these liabilities, that Kindred has any obligation to indemnify the
Company for particular tax liabilities, that Kindred will have sufficient
financial means to enable it to satisfy its indemnity obligations under the Tax
Refund Escrow Agreement or that Kindred will continue to honor its
indemnification obligations.

     THE COMPANY'S RENTAL REVENUES MAY DECREASE IF THE TERMS OF THE LEASES ON
ITS FACILITIES EXPIRE AND THE COMPANY IS UNABLE EITHER TO LOCATE A SATISFACTORY
TENANT OR TO RELET THE FACILITIES ON THE SAME OR BETTER TERMS.

     When the term of the leases on the Company's facilities expire, if the then
current tenants do not renew the lease or a renewal term does not exist, then
the Company will have to relet the facility to the tenant or locate a substitute
tenant. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to locate a
satisfactory tenant for the facilities or that the Company will be able to relet
the facilities upon the same or better terms. If the Company is unable to locate
satisfactory tenants for the facilities as the leases expire or if the Company
is unable to lease the facilities on the same or better terms, then the
Company's rental revenues from the affected facilities will decrease.

     ONE OF THE COMPANY'S INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS MAY OBLIGATE THE COMPANY
TO POST COLLATERAL WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT ITS LIQUIDITY AND ACCESS TO
FINANCING.

     The terms of the Company's interest rate swap agreement entered into at the
time of the 1998 Spin Off (the "1998 Swap") requires that the Company make a
cash payment or otherwise post collateral to the other party to the 1998 Swap if
the fair value loss to the Company exceeds specified threshold levels. Under the
1998 Swap, if collateral must be posted, the amount of that collateral must
equal the difference between the fair value unrealized loss of the 1998 Swap at
the time of such determination and the threshold amount. The posting of
collateral under the 1998 Swap could negatively impact the Company's liquidity
and access to financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will have
sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to post
collateral if required to do so under the 1998 Swap. Failure to post collateral
under the terms of the 1998 Swap could have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

     THE COMPANY HEDGES FLOATING-RATE DEBT WITH INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND MAY
RECORD CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN VALUE OF THESE
INTEREST SWAPS.

     The Company has interest rate swaps that hedge interest payment obligations
on floating-rate debt. The Company periodically assesses its interest rate swaps
in relation to its outstanding balances of floating-rate debt, and based on such
assessments may terminate portions of its swaps or enter into additional swaps.
Termination of swaps with accrued losses, or changes in the value of swaps as a
result of falling interest rates, would result in charges to the Company's
earnings, which could be significant.

     IF THE COMPANY OR ITS PROPERTIES BECOME INVOLVED IN ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS,
IT COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES AND COSTS.

     Under environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real
property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or
toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as
well as other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including
government fines and damages for injuries to persons, natural resources and
adjacent property). Such laws and regulations often impose liability without
regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or
disposal of such substances

                                       35

<PAGE>

and may be imposed on the owner in connection with the activities of a current
or former operator of the property. While the Company is generally indemnified
by the operators of its properties for any environmental costs or liabilities
relating to conditions arising while they operate the facilities, this
indemnification may not be sufficient. See "Business--Environmental Regulation."

Item 2. Properties

     The Company believes that it has a diversified portfolio of healthcare
facilities in terms of geography and the healthcare services provided at such
facilities. The Company believes that the geographic diversity of the properties
makes the portfolio less susceptible to adverse changes in state regulation and
regional economic downturns after consideration of the changes to the terms of
the Original Master Leases that were affected by the Master Leases. The
long-term acute care hospitals owned or ground leased by the Company primarily
provide long-term acute care to medically complex, chronically ill patients,
covering approximately 4,033 beds in 44 hospitals as of December 31, 2001. The
nursing facilities owned or ground leased by the Company are leading providers
of rehabilitation services, including physical, occupational and speech
therapies, and care for patients with Alzheimer's disease, covering
approximately 27,952 beds in 216 nursing facilities as of December 31, 2001. The
personal care facilities owned by the Company provide services including
supporting living services, neurorehabilitation, neurobehavioral management and
vocational programs, covering approximately 136 beds in eight centers as of
December 31, 2001.

     The Company leases its corporate offices in Louisville, Kentucky.

     The following tables set forth information for each of the Master Leases
and the facilities leased thereunder. The chart also includes under the heading
"Other Facilities" those properties under leases with non-Kindred lessees. The
Company and Ventas Realty granted mortgage liens on all of the properties
covered by Master Leases No. 1, 2, 3 and 4 and all of the "Other Facilities"
effective February 28, 2000 as security for the indebtedness under the Credit
Agreement. Ventas Finance granted mortgage liens on all of the properties
covered by the CMBS Master Lease effective December 12, 2001 as security for the
indebtedness under the CMBS Loan Agreement.

Senior Vice President
and General Counsel

     RE:  Request by Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. for a Waiver of the
          Provisions of Article XII of the Certificate of Incorporation of
          Ventas, Inc. (the "Company")
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Mr. Stoller:

          This letter is in response to the request by Cohen & Steers Capital
Management, Inc. ("C&S") for a waiver of the provisions of Article XII of the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company with respect to C&S as described in
the letter from C&S to the Company dated February 25, 2002, which is attached
hereto (the "Request Letter"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein
shall have the meaning set forth in the Request Letter.

          The Board hereby Waives, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this letter and the Request Letter, the application of Article XII
to C&S with respect to the provisions thereof limiting Beneficial Ownership of
Common Stock of the Company for the Waiver Period. The breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in the Request Letter,
or the failure to comply with the covenants and agreements in the Request
Letter, shall cause the Waiver granted in this letter to become retroactively
null and void, and shall retroactively cause any Common Shares owned by C&S in
excess of the otherwise applicable 9.0% Ownership Limit to become designated
Excess Shares under Article XII, in addition to any other remedy available to
the Company.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ownership of the Company's Common
Shares by C&S shall remain subject to the otherwise applicable 9.0% Ownership
Limit in the event that such ownership should result in (i) any "individual"
(within the meaning of Section 542(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"), as modified by Section 856(h) of the Code) owning
(after taking into account the constructive ownership rules of Section 544 of

the Code, as modified by Section 856(h) of the Code) in excess of 9.0% of the
Common Shares or (ii) any 10.0% Company Shareholder, alone or in combination
              --
with other 10.0% Company Shareholders, owning (either directly or by operation
of the attribution rules of Section 318 of the Code, as modified by Section
856(d)(5) of the Code), any interest in the stock of Kindred Healthcare, Inc. or
in the stock, assets, or net profits of any other present or future tenant of
the Company. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "10.0% Company
Shareholder" means a person who, but for the 9.0% Ownership Limit, would
beneficially own 10.0% or more of the total combined voting power, total number,
or total value of all of shares of stock of the Company, either directly or by
operation of the attribution rules of Section 318 of the Code, as modified by
Section 856(d)(5) of the Code.

          If this letter accurately sets forth our understanding, please sign
the letter where indicated below and return a signed copy to me. This letter
shall be of no force and effect, and may be revoked at any point in time prior
to the Company's receipt of a signed copy from C&S.

                                       Very truly yours,

Re:  Request by Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. for Waiver to Provisions
     of Article XII of the Certificate of Incorporation of Ventas, Inc. (the
                           --------------------------------------------------
     "Company")
     ---------

To the Directors of Ventas, Inc.:

     Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. ("C&S") is an investment advisor
registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. As of September 30, 2001,
C&S has purchased on behalf of its investment advisory clients (the "Advisory
Clients"), in the aggregate, 5,808,980 shares of the outstanding common stock,
(the "Common Shares") of the Company (the "Shares"). Pursuant to advisory
contracts with the Advisory Clients, C&S exercises sole investment discretion
over such shares and in certain cases sole voting discretion. No other person
who would constitute, along with C&S and with any one or more of the Advisory
Clients, a "group" as that term is used for purposes of Section 13(d)(3)
("Section 13(d)") of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act") owns any shares of the Company. Because that portion of the
Shares which exceed the Ownership Limit (capitalized terms in this letter are
used as defined in Article XII of the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company) is subject to being designated as Excess Shares under Article XII, C&S
requests that the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") grant a waiver
to C&S and the Advisory Clients from certain of the provisions of Article XII
that relate to limitations upon ownership of Common Shares, so that C&S, its
Advisory Clients, and any other Person who would constitute, along with C&S and
any Advisory Client, a "group" as that term is used for purposes of Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act, may Beneficially Own, in the aggregate, up to 9.9%,
in number of shares or value, of the Common Shares during the period (the
"Waiver Period") from the date hereof, until the expiration of the Waiver Period
(the "Waiver Expiration Date") on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein.

     In consideration and as a condition to such waiver, C&S agrees, on behalf
of itself and with respect to assets C&S manages for the Advisory Clients, that
it shall not take any of the actions described below with respect to any
Additional Shares for so long as such shares shall constitute Additional Shares
or until any of the Events (as defined below) shall occur. "Additional Shares"
shall mean the number of Common Shares owned by all of C&S, the Advisory Clients
and any other persons who would constitute, along with C&S and any Advisory
Client, a "group" under Section 13(d), that exceeds 9.0% of the Common Shares of
the

<PAGE>


Company outstanding. The undersigned has the legal authority to bind C&S and the
Beneficial Owners of C&S to the terms of this letter and the related Waiver.
This letter does not request a waiver in respect of any Common Shares held,
owned, or Beneficially Owned by any Advisory Client that are not managed by C&S.
Nothing in this letter or the Waiver shall restrict the application of Article
XII to such other Common Shares, it being understood that all such other Common
Shares remain subject to Article XII of the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company.

     In support of its request for the Waiver, C&S makes the following
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements:

          1. Expiration of Waiver. The Waiver shall expire, and the Waiver
             --------------------
Period shall terminate, on the first to occur of (a) after C&S Beneficially Owns
more than the Ownership Limitation, on the date that C&S Beneficially Owns less
than the Ownership Limitation, (b) a breach by C&S of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Request
Letter or (c) ninety (90) days after C&S's receipt of notice from the Company
terminating the Waiver. Upon expiration of the Waiver and the Waiver Period with
respect to any Additional Shares, such Additional Shares shall automatically be
designated as "Excess Shares" under Article XII. Such designation will be
effective as of the close of business on the business day prior to the date of
the relevant event. C&S understands and acknowledges that the "Excess Share"
designation shall be in addition to any other remedy that the Company may have
upon a breach by C&S of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein.

          2. Representations and Warranties. C&S represents and warrants to the
             ------------------------------
Company as follows:

          a) As of February 25, 2002, and with respect to any Common Stock under
     C&S management, the Advisory Clients Beneficially Owned in the aggregate
     5,730,615 shares of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company. C&S is not
     in a partnership (as determined for federal income tax purposes) composed
     of C&S and one or more Advisory Clients, and C&S' Advisory Clients do not
     own more than 9.9% of C&S or any corporation controlled or managed by C&S.

          b) No other person who would constitute, along with C&S, a "group" as
     that term is used for purposes of Section 13(d)(3) ("Section 13(d)") of the
     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), owns any
     shares of Common Stock.

          3. Covenants Regarding Ownership Attributes of the Additional Shares.
             -----------------------------------------------------------------
During the Waiver Period, C&S agrees that it shall not take any of the following
actions with respect to any Additional Shares (it being understood that the
limitations of this Section 3 shall not apply to Shares that are not Additional
Shares):

          a) Solicit proxies from stockholders of the Company, the power to
          vote, become a "participant" in any "election contest" (as such terms
          are used in Rule

                                       2

<PAGE>

          14a-11 of the Exchange Act), with respect to the Company, or make any
          communication (other than as required by law) referred to in Rule
          14a-1(l)(2)(iv) of the Exchange Act in connection with any election
          contest or other vote by stockholders of the Company or otherwise that
          is contrary to or conflicts with actions taken or omitted or to be
          omitted by the Board;

          b) Seek or vote for the removal of any member of the Board, except
     removal "for cause" as such term is used under the Delaware General
     Corporation Law;

          c) Vote for any individual nominated for election to the Board thereof
     other than those individuals nominated by the Board or a Committee thereof;

          d) Call or seek to have called any meeting of the stockholders of the
     Company;

          e) Otherwise act, alone or in concert with others to (i) solicit,
     propose, seek to effect or negotiate with any other person with respect to
     (A) any business combination with the Company or (B) any restructuring,
     recapitalization or similar transaction of the Company, (ii) solicit,
     propose, seek to effect or negotiate with any other person with respect to,
     or announce an intent to make, any tender offer or exchange offer for any
     voting securities of the Company, or (iii) assist, participate in,
     facilitate or solicit any effort or attempt by any persons to do or seek to
     do any of the foregoing; or

          f) Form, join or participate in a "group" (within the meaning of
     Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) with respect to any of the matters
     described above.

          4. Additional Covenants Regarding Ownership of Common Stock. During
             --------------------------------------------------------
the Waiver Period:

          a) C&S shall limit the aggregate Beneficial Ownership by it, any
     Advisory Client and any Person who would constitute, along with C&S or C&S
     with any such Person or Advisory Client, a "group", as that term is used
     for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, of the Company's Common
     Stock to no more than 9.9% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding.

          b) Neither 10% or greater Beneficial Owners of C&S, C&S nor any of its
     Advisory Clients, taken separately or taken together in any combination
     with C&S, have been during 2000 or 2001, are, and shall not in the future
     be, partners in any partnership between or among C&S and any one or more of
     them as determined for federal income tax purposes which partnership
     Beneficially Owns any of the Company's Common Stock. With respect to assets
     under C&S' management, no single Advisory Client or combination of Advisory
     Clients with a mutual 10.0% or greater owner or any Person in control of
     them, Beneficially Owns or will at any time in the future Beneficially Own
     more than 9.0% of the Company's Common Stock outstanding. Neither C&S nor
     any Advisory Client, with respect to assets under C&S' management,
     currently Beneficially

                                       3

<PAGE>

     Owns, and will not Beneficially Own, more than 9.0% of the Company's Common
     Stock outstanding (excluding for this purpose Beneficial Ownership of
     Common Stock in excess of such amounts to the extent such Beneficial
     Ownership results solely from it being treated, along with the Advisory
     Clients, as a "group" under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act).

          c) C&S, its Advisory Clients and any Person who would constitute,
     along with C&S or any Advisory Client, a "group" under Section 13(d) of the
     Exchange Act, shall comply with the terms of Article XII, except as
     expressly waived by the Board.

          d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this letter or the related
     waiver, if any 10.0% or greater Beneficial Owners of C&S, C&S, its Advisory
     Clients, or any other person who would, along with C&S or the Beneficial
     Owners of C&S or any of them, either constitute a "group" under Section
     13(d)(3) or a partnership for federal income tax purposes, Beneficially
     Owns (excluding for this purpose Beneficial Ownership of Common Stock that
     results solely from being treated as part of a "group" under Section 13(d))
     more than 9.9% of the stock of the Company while Beneficially Owning,
     singly or taken together in any combination, any of the stock, warrants,
     options, convertible debt or any other rights to acquire the stock of
     Kindred Healthcare, Inc. or, after written notice from the Company to C&S
     of a proposed new tenant after the date hereof, any other such tenant of
     the Company, the Additional Shares owned will be automatically designated
     as "Excess Shares" under Article XII. Such designation will be effective as
     of the close of business on the business day prior to the date of the
     relevant event.

          e) This letter does not request a waiver in respect of any Common
     Shares held, owned, or Beneficially Owned by any Advisory Client that are
     not managed by C&S. Nothing in this letter or the Waiver shall restrict the
     application of Article XII to such other Common Shares, it being understood
     that all such other Common Shares remain subject to Article XII of the
     Certificate of Incorporation of the Company.

          5. Breach of Representations and Warranties. C&S understands that the
             ----------------------------------------
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein or the
failure to comply with its covenants and undertakings in this letter, in
addition to any other remedy available to the Company, subjects the Additional
Shares to being designated as "Excess Shares" under Article XII. In such event,
any waiver granted by the Board shall terminate and the Company may proceed in
any manner permitted under Article XII.

                                       4

<PAGE>

          6. Reduction and Termination of the Waiver. If at any time after C&S
             ---------------------------------------
Beneficially Owns more than the Ownership Limitation the ownership of Common
Shares by any Person covered by this waiver falls below the 9% limitation, this
waiver shall, as to each such Person, lapse and be of no further effect, with
the consequence that thereafter any subsequent purported acquisition of Common
Shares in violation of such limitation shall result in any shares above the 9%
limitation being Excess Shares.

                                    Very truly yours,

                                    COHEN & STEERS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC.

will govern certain other matters prior to and following the Distribution;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants
contained in this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

                                  ARTICLE I.

                                 DEFINITIONS

     3.04.   Procedure For Indemnification.
             -----------------------------

     (a)     If any Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion of any Third
Party Claim with respect to which an Indemnifying Party is obligated under this
Agreement to provide indemnification, such Indemnitee shall give such
Indemnifying Party notice thereof promptly after becoming aware of such Third
Party Claim; provided, however, that the failure of any Indemnitee to give
             --------  -------
notice as provided in this Section 3.04 shall not relieve any Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under this Article III, except to the extent that such
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. Such
notice shall describe such Third Party Claim in reasonable detail and$ if
practicable, shall indicate the estimated amount of the Indemnifiable Loss that
has been or may be sustained by such Indemnitee. Thereafter, such Indemnitee
shall deliver to the Indemnafying Party, promptly after the Indemnitee's
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnitee relating to such Third Party Claim.


     (b)     An Indemnifying Party, at such Indemnifying Party's own
expense and through counsel chosen by such Indemnifying Party (which counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee), may elect to defend any
Third Party Claim. If an Indemnifying Party elects to defend a Third Party
Claim, then, within fifteen Business Days after receiving notice of such Third
Party Claim or sooner (but in no event less than five Business Days) if the
nature of such Third Party Claim so requires, such Indemnifying Party shall
notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so. Such Indemnitee shall thereupon
use reasonable efforts to make available to such Indemnifying Party, at such
Indemnifying Party's expense, such assistance in support of the prosecution or
defense of such litigation as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request,
including without limitation, the right to assert in the name of the Indemnitee
such rights, claims, counterclaims or defenses that such Indemnitee would be or
would have been permitted to assert in such litigation or in the prosecution of
a claim or counterclaim against a Third Party or in defense against such Third
Party Claim had the Distribution not occurred. Such Indemnifying Party shall
pay such Indemnitee's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with such cooperation consistent with the provisiofs of Article III. Except as
provided herein, after notice from an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnitee of
its election to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable to such Indemnitee under this

                                     -16-

<PAGE>

Article III for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof. If an Indemnifying Party
elects not to defend against a Third Party Claim, or fails to notify an
Indemnitee of its election as provided in this Section 3.04 within the period
of fifteen (or five, if applicable) Business Days described above, such
Indemnitee may defend, compromise and settle such Third Party Claim; provided,
                                                                     --------
however, that no such Indemnitee may compromise or settle any such Third Party
- -------
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

     (c)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, settle or compromise any
Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgmeft which does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or
plaantiff to the Indemnitee of a written release from all Liability in respect
of such Third Party Claim.


     (d)     If an Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or to seek to
compromise any Third Party Claim, the related Indemnitee shall make available
to such Indemnifying Partq any personnel or any books, records or other
documents within its control or which it otherwise has the ability to make
available that are necessary or appropriate for such defense.

     (e)     Any claim on account of an Indemnifiable Loss arising out of or
due to the failure to pay, perform or discharge in due course its respective
Liabilities by any member of the Indemnifying Party's Group who has an
obligation with respect thereto but which does not result from a Third Party
Claim shall be asserted by written notice given by the Indemnitee to the
related Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party shall have a period of 30
days after the receipt of such notice within which to respond thereto. If such
Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 30-day period. Such
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have refused to accept responsibility to
make payment. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 30-day
period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, such Indemnitee shall be free
to pursue such remedies as may be available to such party under Article VI of
this Agreement.

     (f)     If the amount of any Indemnifiable Loss shall, at any time
subsequent to the payment required by this Agreement, be reduced by recovery,
settlement or otherwise, t`e amount of such reduction, less any expenses
incurred in connection therewith, shall promptly be repaid by the Indemnitee to
the Indemnifying Party.

     (g)     In the event of payment by an Indemnifying Party to any

shall use its reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be takef, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable laws, regulations and agreements to consummate and
make effective t`e transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to confirm
Healthcare Company's title to all of the Healthcare Company Assets and
assumption of all Healthcare Company Liabilities, to put Healthcare Company in
actual possession and operating control of the Healthcare Company Assets, and
to permit Healthcare Company to exercise all rights and to perform its
obligations with respect to the Healthcare Business. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party hereto shall cooperate with the other party, and execute
and deliver, or use its reasonable efforts to cause to be executed and
delivered, all instruments, including instruments of conveyance, assignment and
transfer, and to make all filings with, and to obtain all consents, approvals
or authorizations of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person under any
permit, license, agreement, indenture or other instrument, and take all such
other actions as such party may reasonably be requested to take by any other
party hereto from time to time, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, in
order to effectuate the provisions and purposes of this Agreement, the
Corporate Restructuring Transactions, the assumption of Liabilities and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. If the Corporate Restructuring
Transactions or assumption of Liabilities, including but not limited to,
assignments of contracts, is not consummated prior to or at the Distribution
Date for any reason, including but not limited to, the absence of receipt of
any Consents, then the party hereto retaining such asset or Liability shall
thereafter hold such asset in trust for the use and benefit of the party
entitled thereto (at the expense of the party entitled thereto), or shall
retain such Liability for the account of the party by whom such Liability is to
be assumed pursuant hereto, as the case may be, and shall take such other
action as may be reasonably requested by the party to whom such asset is to be
transferred, or by whom such Liability is to be assumed, as the case may be, in
order to place such party, insofar as reasonably possible, in the same position
as if such asset or Liability had been transferred as contemplated hereby. If
and when any such asset or Liability becomes transferable, such transfer shall
be effected forthwith. The parties hereto agree that, as of the Distribution
Date, as between the parties, Healthcare Company shall be deemed to have
acquired complete and sole beneficial ownership of all of the Healthcare
Company Assets, together with all rights, powers and privileges incident
thereto, and shall be deemed to have assumed in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement all of the Healthcare Company Liabilities, and all duties,
obligations and responsibilities incident thereto.


     (b)     Without limiting the generality of Section 4.01(a), Vencor, as
the sole stockholder of Healthcare Company prior to the Distribution, shall
ratify any actions which are reasonably necessary or desirable to be taken by
Healthcare Company to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements in a manner consistent with the terms of
this Agreement or such Ancillary Agreements.

permit Healthcare Company to use the registration, license or permit of the
Vencor Group to continue to operate the Healthcare Company Business until such
transfer, amendment or issuance is accomplished, at Healthcare Company's
expense, if permitted by Law, until such permit is transferred or issued to

Company's expense, shall use reasonable efforts to make available to Healthcare
Company such assistance in support of the prosecution of such litigation as
Healthcare Company may reasonably request, including without limitation, the
right to assert, as needed, in the name of Vencor or any member of the Vencor
Group such rights and claims that Vencor or such member would be or would have
been permitted to assert in such litigation had the Distribution not occurred;
provided, however, that no member of the Vencor Group shall be required to take

Agent shall have received specific joint written investment instruction from

its timely receipt of such specific joint written investment instruction from
Vencor and Ventas, the Escrow Agent shall be authorized to, and shall, invest
any of the Escrow Property in the Janus Government Money Market Fund (#882)
until specific written investment instruction is received from Vencor and
Ventas. All earnings received from the investment of the Escrow Property shall

shall have no liability for any investment losses, including without limitation
any market loss on any investment liquidated prior to maturity in order to make
a payment required hereunder.

            4.3. Tax Reporting. The Interested Parties and the Escrow Agent
                 -------------
agree to treat each of Vencor and Ventas as the tax owner of 50% of the Escrow
Property and to file all tax reports consistently with such treatment. The
Interested Parties agree that, for tax reporting purposes, all interest or other
income earned from the investment of the Escrow Property in any tax year shall
be reported as allocated equally to each of the Interested Parties. The Escrow
Agent will provide any necessary taxpayer tax reporting forms or certificates to
Vencor and Ventas consistent therewith.

                 -----------------------------------------------
Parties hereto agree to provide the Escrow Agent with a certified tax
identification number by signing and returning a Form W-9 to the Escrow Agent
upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement. The Interested Parties
understand that, in the event their tax identification numbers are not certified
to the Escrow Agent, the Internal Revenue Code, as amended from time to time,
may require withholding of a portion of any interest or other income earned on
the investment of the Escrow Property.

            4.5. Quarterly and Annual Reports. The Escrow Agent shall, within
                 ----------------------------
fifteen (15) calendar days following the end of each quarterly period during
each calendar year commencing with the date of this Agreement, provide a written
statement to Vencor and Ventas reporting the interest or other income earned on
the Escrow Property during that quarter and over the current taxable year and
the assets on hand as of the end of such quarter and a detailed summary of all
payments made out of the Escrow Property during such quarter. The Escrow Agent
shall provide an annual report containing such information for each calendar
year by January 15th immediately following each calendar year. The currently
applicable taxable year of each Interested Party is the calendar year, which may
be changed by either Interested Party with a written notice to the Escrow Agent
thirty days prior to the requested change.

of any book entry depository, securities intermediary or other subescrow agent
was caused by the Escrow Agent's own gross negligence or willful misconduct in
breach of this Agreement.

          (d) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of
any investment permitted by this Agreement, to deal with itself (in its
individual capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or

after (i) it has received the applicable documents required under this Agreement
in good form, or (ii) passage of the applicable time period (or both, as
applicable under the terms of this Agreement), as the case may be.

upon the respective parties hereto and their heirs, executors, successors and
assigns. If the Escrow Agent consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers

                (b) Modifications. This Agreement may not be altered or modified

shall constitute a waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Escrow
Agreement, unless such waiver is specified in writing, and then only to the
extent so specified. A waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Escrow
Agreement on one occasion shall not constitute a waiver of the other terms of
this Escrow Agreement, or of such terms and conditions on any other occasion.

modifications which may hereafter be executed, and (b) certificates and other
information previously or hereafter furnished, may be reproduced by any
photographic, photostatic, microfilm, optical disk, micro-card, miniature
photographic or other similar process. The parties agree that any such

regular course of business, and that any enlargement, facsimile or further
reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence.

 (Multicurrency--Cross Border)

                                   ISDA(R)

                  International Swap Dealers Association, Inc.

                                MASTER AGREEMENT

                          dated as of December 11, 2001

Banc of America Financial Products, Inc. and Ventas Finance I, LLC have entered
into and/or anticipate entering into one or more transactions (each a
"Transaction") that are or will be governed by this Master Agreement, which
includes the schedule (the "Schedule"), and the documents and other confirming
evidence (each a "Confirmation") exchanged between the parties confirming those
Transactions.

Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:--

1.   Interpretation

(a)  Definitions. The terms defined in Section 14 and in the Schedule will have
the meanings therein specified for the purpose of this Master Agreement.

(b)  Inconsistency. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of
the Schedule and the other provisions of this Master Agreement, the Schedule
will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of any
Confirmation and this Master Agreement (including the Schedule), such
Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the relevant Transaction.

(c)  Single Agreement. All Transactions are entered into in reliance on the fact
that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement between
the parties (collectively referred to as this "Agreement"), and the parties
would not otherwise enter into any Transactions.

2.   Obligations

(a)  General Conditions.

     (i) Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in each
     Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions of this
     Agreement.

     (ii) Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for value
     on that date in the place of the account specified in the relevant
     Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, in freely
     transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in

        Copyright(C)1992 by International Swap Dealers Association, Inc.

<PAGE>

     the required currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that is, other than
     by payment), such delivery will be made for receipt on the due date in the
     manner customary for the relevant obligation unless otherwise specified in
     the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.

     (iii) Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to (1)
     the condition precedent that no Event of Default or Potential Event of
     Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is continuing, (2)
     the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date in respect of the
     relevant Transaction has occurred or been effectively designated and (3)
     each other applicable condition precedent specified in this Agreement.

(b)  Change of Account. Either party may change its account for receiving a
payment or delivery by giving notice to the other party at least five Local
Business Days prior to the scheduled date for the payment or delivery to which
such change applies unless such other party gives timely notice of a reasonable
objection to such change.

(c)  Netting. If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable:--

     (i)  in the same currency; and

     (ii) in respect of the same Transaction,

by each party to the other, then, on such date, each party's obligation to make
payment of any such amount will be automatically satisfied and discharged and,
if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one party
exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by the other
party, replaced by an obligation upon the party by whom the larger aggregate
amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the excess of the
larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.

The parties may elect in respect of two or more Transactions that a net amount
will be determined in respect of all amounts payable on the same date in the
same currency in respect of such Transactions, regardless of whether such
amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction. The election may be made
in the Schedule or a Confirmation by specifying that subparagraph (ii) above
will not apply to the Transactions identified as being subject to the election,
together with the starting date (in which case subparagraph (ii) above will not,
or will cease to, apply to such Transactions from such date). This election may
be made separately for different groups of Transactions and will apply
separately to each pairing of Offices through which the parties make and receive
payments or deliveries.

(d)  Deduction or Withholding for Tax.

     (i) Gross-Up. All payments under this Agreement will be made without any
     deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such deduction
     or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified by the
     practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in effect. If
     a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party ("X") will:--

          (1)  promptly notify the other party ("Y") of such requirement;

                                       2

<PAGE>

          (2) pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be
          deducted or withheld (including the full amount required to be
          deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by X to Y under
          this Section 2(d)) promptly upon the earlier of determining that such
          deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such
          amount has been assessed against Y;

          (3) promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a certified copy),
          or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, evidencing such
          payment to such authorities; and

          (4) if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition to the
          payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under this Agreement, such
          additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount
          actually received by Y (free and clear of Indemnifiable Taxes whether
          assessed against X or Y) will equal the full amount Y would have
          received had no such deduction or withholding been required. However,
          X will not be required to pay any additional amount to Y to the extent
          that it would not be required to be paid but for:--

               (A) the failure by Y to comply with or perform any agreement
               contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d); or

               (B) the failure of a representation made by Y pursuant to Section
               3(f) to be accurate and true unless such failure would not have
               occurred but for (I) any action taken by a taxing authority, or
               brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the
               date on which a Transaction is entered into (regardless of
               whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party
               to this Agreement) or (II) a Change in Tax Law.

     (ii) Liability. If:--

          (1) X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice
          of any relevant governmental revenue authority, to make any deduction
          or withholding in respect of which X would not be required to pay an
          additional amount to Y under Section 2(d)(i)(4);

          (2) X does not so deduct or withhold, and

          (3) a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly against
          X;

     then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies the liability
     resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the amount of such
     liability (including any related liability for interest, but including any
     related liability for penalties only if Y has failed to comply with or
     perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).

(e)  Default Interest; Other Amounts. Prior to the occurrence or effective
designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction,
a party that defaults in the performance of any payment obligation will, to the
extent permitted by law and subject to Section 6(c), be required to pay interest
(before as well as after judgment) on the overdue amount

                                       3

<PAGE>

to the other party on demand in the same currency as such overdue amount, for
the period from (and including) the original due date for payment to (but
excluding) the date of actual payment, at the Default Rate. Such interest will
be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days
elapsed. If, prior to the occurrence or effective designation of an Early
Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction, a party defaults in the
performance of any obligation required to be settled by delivery, it will
compensate the other party on demand if and to the extent provided for in the
relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.

3.   Representations

Each party represents to the other party (which representations will be deemed
to be repeated by each party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into
and, in the case of the representations in Section 3(f), at all times until the
termination of this Agreement) that:--

(a)  Basic Representations.

     (i) Status. It is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the
     jurisdiction of its organisation or incorporation and, if relevant under
     such laws, in good standing;

     (ii) Powers. It has the power to execute this Agreement and any other
     documentation relating to this Agreement to which it is a party, to deliver
     this Agreement and any other documentation relating to this Agreement that
     it is required by this Agreement to deliver and to perform its obligations
     under this Agreement and any obligations it has under any Credit Support
     Document to which it is a party and has taken all necessary action to
     authorize such execution, delivery and performance;

     (iii) No Violation or Conflict. Such execution, delivery and performance do
     not violate or conflict with any law applicable to it, any provision of its
     constitutional documents, any order or judgment of any court or other
     agency of government applicable to it or any of its assets or any
     contractual restriction binding on or affecting it or any of its assets;

     (iv) Consents. All governmental and other consents that are required to
     have been obtained by it with respect to this Agreement or any Credit
     Support Document to which it is a party have been obtained and are in full
     force and effect and all conditions of any such consents have been complied
     with; and

     (v) Obligations Binding. Its obligations under this Agreement and any
     Credit Support Document to which it is a party constitute its legal, valid
     and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their respective
     terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
     moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and
     subject, as to enforceability, to equitable principles of general
     application (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in
     equity or at law)).

(b)  Absence of Certain Events. No Event of Default or Potential Event of
Default or, to its knowledge, Termination Event with respect to it has occurred
and is continuing and no such event or circumstance would occur as a result of
its entering into or performing its obligations under this Agreement or any
Credit Support Document to which it is a party.

                                       4

<PAGE>

(c)  Absence of Litigation. There is not pending or, to its knowledge,
threatened against it or any of its Affiliates any action, suit or proceeding at
law or in equity or before any court, tribunal, governmental body, agency or

which it is a party or its ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or such Credit Support Document.

(d)  Accuracy of Specified Information. All applicable information that is

4.   Agreements

Each party agrees with the other that, so long as either party has or may have
any obligation under this Agreement or under any Credit Support Document to
which it is a party:--

(a)  Furnish Specified Information. It will deliver to the other party or, in
certain cases under subparagraph (iii) below, to such government or taxing
authority as the other party reasonably directs:--

     (i)  any forms, documents or certificates relating to taxation specified in
     the Schedule or any Confirmation;

     (ii)  any other documents specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation;
     and

     (iii) upon reasonable demand by such other party, any form or document that
     may be required or reasonably requested in writing in order to allow such
     other party or its Credit Support Provider to make a payment under this
     Agreement or any applicable Credit Support Document without any deduction
     or withholding for or on account of any Tax or with such deduction or
     withholding at a reduced rate (so long as the completion, execution or
     submission of such form or document would not materially prejudice the
     legal or commercial position of the party in receipt of such demand), with
     any such form or document to be accurate and completed in a manner
     reasonably satisfactory to such other party and to be executed and to be
     delivered with any reasonably required certification,

in each case by the date specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation or, if
none is specified, as soon as reasonably practicable.

(b)  Maintain Authorisations. It will use all reasonable efforts to maintain in
full force and effect all consents of any governmental or other authority that
are required to be obtained by it

                                       5

<PAGE>

with respect to this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a
party and will use all reasonable efforts to obtain any that may become
necessary in the future.

(c)  Comply with Laws. It will comply in all material respects with all
applicable laws and orders to which it may be subject if failure so to comply
would material impair its ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party.

(d)  Tax Agreement. It will give notice of any failure of a representation made
by it under Section 3(f) to be accurate and true promptly upon learning of such
failure.

(e)  Payment of Stamp Tax. Subject to Section 11, it will pay any Stamp Tax
levied or imposed upon it or in respect of its execution or performance of this
Agreement by a jurisdiction in which it is incorporated, organised, managed and
controlled, or considered to have its seat, or in which a branch or office
through which it is acting for the purpose of this Agreement is located ("Stamp
Tax Jurisdiction") and will indemnify the other party against any Stamp Tax
levied or imposed upon the other party or in respect of the other party's
execution or performance of this Agreement by any such Stamp Tax Jurisdiction
which is not also a Stamp Tax Jurisdiction with respect to the other party.

5.   Events of Default and Termination Events

(a)  Events of Default. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or,
if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity
of such party of any of the following events constitutes an event of default (an
"Event of Default") with respect to such party --

     (i)   Failure to Pay or Deliver. Failure by the party to make, when due,
     any payment under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e)
     required to be made by it if such failure is not remedied on or before the
     third Local Business Day after notice of such failure is given to the
     party;

     (ii)  Breach of Agreement. Failure by the party to comply with or perform
     any agreement or obligation (other than an obligation to make any payment
     under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) or to give
     notice of a Termination Event or any agreement or obligation under Section
     4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)) to be complied with or performed by the party
     in accordance with this Agreement if such failure is not remedied on or
     before the thirtieth day after notice of such failure is given to the
     party;

     (iii) Credit Support Default.

          (1) Failure by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party
          to comply with or perform any agreement or obligation to be complied
          with or performed by it in accordance with any Credit Support Document
          if such failure is continuing after any applicable grace period has
          elapsed;

                                       6

<PAGE>

          (2) the expiration or termination of such Credit Support Document or
          the failing or ceasing of such Credit Support Document to be in full
          force and effect for the purpose of this Agreement (in either case
          other than in accordance with its terms) prior to the satisfaction of
          all obligations of such party under each Transaction to which such
          Credit Support Document relates without the written consent of the
          other party; or

          (3) the party or such Credit Support Provider disaffirms, disclaims,
          repudiates or rejects, in whole or in part, or challenges the validity
          of, such Credit Support Document;

     (iv) Misrepresentation. A representation (other than a representation under
     Section 3(e) or (f)) made or repeated or deemed to have been made or
     repeated by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party in this
     Agreement or any Credit Support Document proves to have been incorrect or
     misleading in any material respect when made or repeated or deemed to have
     been made or repeated;

     (v)  Default under Specified Transaction. The party, any Credit Support
     Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party (1)
     defaults under a Specified Transaction and, after giving effect to any
     applicable notice requirement or grace period, there occurs a liquidation
     of, an acceleration of obligations under, or an early termination of, that
     Specified Transaction, (2) defaults, after giving effect to any applicable
     notice requirement or grace period, in making any payment or delivery due
     on the last payment, delivery or exchange date of, or any payment on early
     termination of, a Specified Transaction (or such default continues for at
     least three Local Business Days if there is no applicable notice
     requirement or grace period) or (3) disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or
     rejects, in whole or in part, a Specified Transaction (or such action is
     taken by any person or entity appointed or empowered to operate it or act
     on its behalf);

     (vi) Cross Default. If "Cross Default" is specified in the Schedule as
     applying to the party, the occurrence or existence of (1) a default, event
     of default or other similar condition or event (however described) in
     respect of such party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any
     applicable Specified Entity of such party under one or more agreements or
     instruments relating to Specified Indebtedness of any of them (individually
     or collectively) in an aggregate amount of not less than the applicable
     Threshold Amount (as specified in the Schedule) which has resulted in such
     Specified Indebtedness becoming, or becoming capable at such time of being
     declared, due and payable under such agreements or instruments, before it
     would otherwise have been due and payable or (2) a default by such party,
     such Credit Support Provider or such Specified Entity (individually or
     collectively) in making one or more payments on the due date thereof in an
     aggregate amount of not less than the applicable Threshold Amount under
     such agreements or instruments (after giving effect to any applicable
     notice requirement or grace period);

     (vii) Bankruptcy. The party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or
     any applicable Specified Entity of such party:--

                                       7

<PAGE>

            (1) is dissolved (other than pursuant to a consolidation,
            amalgamation or merger); (2) becomes insolvent or is unable to pay
            its debts or fails or admits in writing its inability generally to
            pay its debts as they become due; (3) makes a general assignment,
            arrangement or composition with or for the benefit of its creditors;
            (4) institutes or has instituted against it a proceeding seeking a
            judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or any other relief under any
            bankruptcy or insolvency law or other similar law affecting
            creditors' rights, or a petition is presented for its winding-up or
            liquidation, and, in the case of any such proceeding or petition
            instituted or presented against it, such proceeding or petition (A)
            results in a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or the entry of an
            order for relief or the making of an order for its winding-up or
            liquidation or (B) is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or
            restrained in each case within 30 days of the institution or
            presentation thereof; (5) has a resolution passed for its
            winding-up, official management or liquidation (other than pursuant
            to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (6) seeks or becomes
            subject to the appointment of an administrator, provisional
            liquidator, conservator, receiver, trustee, custodian or other
            similar official for it or for all or substantially all its assets;
            (7) has a secured party take possession of all or substantially all
            its assets or has a distress, execution, attachment, sequestration
            or other legal process levied, enforced or sued on or against all or
            substantially all its assets and such secured party maintains
            possession, or any such process is not dismissed, discharged, stayed
            or restrained, in each case within 30 days thereafter; (8) causes or
            is subject to any event with respect to it which, under the
            applicable laws of any jurisdiction, has an analogous effect to any
            of the events specified in clauses (1) to (7) (inclusive); or (9)
            takes any action in furtherance of, or indicating its consent to,
            approval of, of acquiescence in, any of the foregoing acts; or

     (viii) Merger Without Assumption. The party or any Credit Support Provider
     of such party consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or
     transfers all or substantially all its assets to, another entity and, at
     the time of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer:--

            (1) the resulting, surviving or transferee entity fails to assume
            all the obligations of such party or such Credit Support Provider
            under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it or
            its predecessor was a party by operation of law or pursuant to an
            agreement reasonably satisfactory to the other party to this
            Agreement; or

            (2) the benefits of any Credit Support Document fail to extend
            (without the consent of the other party) to the performance by such
            resulting, surviving or transferee entity of its obligations under
            this Agreement.

(b)  Termination Events. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or,
if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity
of such party of any event specified below constitutes an Illegality if the
event is specified in (i) below, a Tax Event if the event is specified in (ii)
below or a Tax Event upon Merger if the event is specified in (iii) below, and,
if specified to be applicable, a Credit Event Upon Merger if the event is
specified pursuant

                                       8

<PAGE>

to (iv) below or an Additional Termination Event if the event is specified
pursuant to (v) below:--

     (i)   Illegality. Due to the adoption of, or any change in, any applicable
     law after the date on which a Transaction is entered into, or due to the
     promulgation of, or any change in, the interpretation by any court,
     tribunal or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction of any
     applicable law after such date, it becomes unlawful (other than as a result
     of a breach by the party of Section 4(b)) for such party (which will be the
     Affected Party):--

          (1) to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment
          or delivery or to receive a payment or delivery in respect of such
          Transaction or to comply with any other material provision of this
          Agreement relating to such Transaction; or

          (2) to perform, or for any Credit Support Provider of such party to
          perform, any contingent or other obligation which the party (or such
          Credit Support Provider) has under any Credit Support Document
          relating to such Transaction,

     (ii)  Tax Event. Due to (x) any action taken by a taxing authority, or
     brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on which
     a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken
     or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (y) a Change in
     Tax Law, the party (which will be the Affected Party) will, or there is a
     substantial likelihood that it will, on the next succeeding Scheduled
     Payment Date (1) be required to pay to the other party an additional amount
     in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in
     respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or (2) receive a
     payment from which an amount is required to be deducted or withheld for or
     on account of a Tax (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e),
     6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) and no additional amount is required to be paid in
     respect of such Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (other than by reason of
     Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B));

     (iii) Tax Event Upon Merger. The party (the "Burdened Party") on the next
     succeeding Scheduled Payment Date will either (1) be required to pay an
     additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section
     2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or
     6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount has been deducted or
     withheld for or on account of any Indemnifiable Tax in respect of which the
     other party is not required to pay an additional amount (other than by
     reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)), in either case as a result of a
     party consolidating or amalgamating with, or merging with or into, or
     transferring all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (which
     will be the Affected Party) where such action does not constitute an event
     described in Section 5(a)(viii);

     (iv)  Credit Event Upon Merger. If "Credit Event Upon Merger" is specified
     in the Schedule as applying to the party, such party ("X"), any Credit
     Support Provider of X or any applicable Specified Entity of X consolidates
     or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or
     substantially all its assets to, another entity and such action does not
     constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii) but the
     creditworthiness of the

                                       9

<PAGE>

     resulting, surviving or transferee entity is materially weaker than that of
     X, such Credit Support Provider or such Specified Entity, as the case may
     be, immediately prior to such action (and, in such event, X or its
     successor or transferee, as appropriate, will be the Affected Party); or

     (v)  Additional Termination Event. If any "Additional Termination Event" is
     specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying, the occurrence
     of such event (and, in such event, the Affected Party or Affected Parties
     shall be as specified for such Additional Termination Event in the Schedule
     or such Confirmation).

(c)  Event of Default and Illegality. If an event or circumstance which would
otherwise constitute or give rise to an Event of Default also constitutes an
Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality and will not constitute an Event
of Default.

6.   Early Termination

(a)  Right to Terminate Following Event of Default. If at any time an Event of
Default with respect to a party (the "Defaulting Party") has occurred and is
then continuing, the other party (the "Non-defaulting Party") may, by not more
than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of
Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an
Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions. If, however,
"Automatic Early Termination" is specified in the Schedule as applying to a
party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions
will occur immediately upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an
Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(1), (3), (5), (6) or, to the
extent analogous thereto, (8), and as of the time immediately preceding the
institution of the relevant proceeding or the presentation of the relevant
petition upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default
specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8)

(b)  Right to Terminate Following Termination Event.

     (i)  Notice. If a Termination Event occurs, an Affected Party will,
     promptly upon becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying the
     nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction and will
     also give such other information about that Termination Event as the other
     party may reasonably require.

     (ii) Transfer to Avoid Termination Event. If either an Illegality under
     Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there is only one Affected
     Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is the
     Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to its right to
     designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv), use all
     reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss,
     excluding immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer within 20 days after
     it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all its rights and obligations under
     this Agreement in respect of the Affected Transactions to another of its
     Offices or Affiliates so that such Termination Event ceases to exist.

                                       10

<PAGE>

     If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give
     notice to the other party to that effect within such 20 day period,
     whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days after
     notice is given under Section 6(b)(i).

     Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject to
     and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party, which
     consent will not be withheld if such other party's policies in effect at
     such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the transferee on
     the terms proposed.

     (iii) Two Affected Parties. If an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a
     Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party will use
     all reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after notice
     thereof is given under Section 6(b)(i) on action to avoid that Termination
     Event.

     (iv)  Right to Terminate. If:-

            (1) a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section
            6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected with respect to
            all Affected Transactions within 30 days after an Affected Party
            gives notice under Section 6(b)(i), or

            (2) an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(2), a Credit Event Upon
            Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs, or a Tax Event
            Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected Party,

     either party in the case of an Illegality, the Burdened Party in the case
     of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party in the case of a Tax Event
     or an Additional Termination Event if there is more than one Affected
     Party, or the party which is not the Affected Party in the case of a Credit
     Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if there is only one
     Affected Party may, by not more than 20 days notice to the other party and
     provided that the relevant Termination Event is then continuing, designate
     a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early
     Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions

(c)  Effect of Designation.

     (i) If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under Section
     6(a) or (b), the Early Termination Date will occur on the date so
     designated, whether or not the relevant Event of Default or Termination
     Event is then continuing.

     (ii) Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination
     Date, no further payments or deliveries under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) in
     respect of the Terminated Transactions will be required to be made, but
     without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement. The amount, if
     any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date shall be determined
     pursuant to Section 6(e).

                                       11

<PAGE>

(d)  Calculations.

     (i)  Statement. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the
     occurrence of an Early Termination Date, each party will make the
     calculations on its part, if any, contemplated by Section 6(e) and will
     provide to the other party a statement (1) showing, in reasonable detail,
     such calculations (including all relevant quotations and specifying any
     amount payable under Section 6(e)) and (2) giving details of the relevant
     account to which any amount payable to it is to be paid. In the absence of
     written confirmation from the source of a quotation obtained in determining
     a Market Quotation, the records of the party obtaining such quotation will
     be conclusive evidence of the existence and accuracy of such quotation.

     (ii) Payment Date. An amount calculated as being due in respect of any
     Early Termination Date under Section 6(e) will be payable on the date that
     notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early
     Termination Date which is designated or occurs as a result of an Event of
     Default) and on the day which is two Local Business Days after the day on
     which notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early
     Termination Date which is designated as a result of a Termination Event)
     Such amount will be paid together with (to the extent permitted under
     applicable law) interest thereon (before as well as after judgment) in the
     Termination Currency, from (and including) the relevant Early Termination
     Date to (but excluding) the date such amount is paid, at the Applicable
     Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding
     and the actual number of days elapsed.

(e)  Payments on Early Termination. If an Early Termination Date occurs, the
following provisions shall apply based on the parties' election in the Schedule
of a payment measure, either "Market Quotation" or "Loss," and a payment method,
either the "First Method" or the "Second Method." If the parties fail to
designate a payment measure or payment method in the Schedule, it will be deemed
that "Market Quotation" or the "Second Method", as the case may be, shall apply.
The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date and
determined pursuant to this Section will be subject to any Set-off

     (i)  Events of Default. If the Early Termination Date results from an Event
     of Default:-

            (1) First Method and Market Quotation. If the First Method and
            Market Quotation apply, the Defaulting Party will pay to the
            Non-defaulting Party the excess, if a positive number, of (A) the
            sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the Non-defaulting
            Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions and the Termination
            Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the
            Non-defaulting Party over (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of
            the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party.

            (2) First Method and Loss. If the First Method and Loss apply, the
            Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party, if a positive
            number, the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in respect of this
            Agreement.

                                       12

<PAGE>

            (3) Second Method and Market Quotation. If the Second Method and
            Market Quotation apply, an amount will be payable equal to (A) the
            sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the Non-defaulting
            Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions and the Termination
            Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the
            Non-defaulting Party less (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of
            the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party. If that amount is
            a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the
            Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting
            Party will pay the absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting
            Party.

            (4) Second Method and Loss. If the Second Method and Loss apply, an
            amount will be payable equal to the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in
            respect of this Agreement. If that amount is a positive number, the
            Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a
            negative number, the Non-defaulting Party; will pay the absolute
            value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.

     (ii) Termination Events. If the Early Termination Date results from a
     Termination Event.-

            (1) One Affected Party. If there is one Affected Party, the amount
            payable will be determined in accordance with Section 6(e)(i)(3), if
            Market Quotation applies, or Section 6(e)(i)(4), if Loss applies,
            except that, in either case, references to the Defaulting Party and
            to the Non-defaulting Party will be deemed to be references to the
            Affected Party and the party which is not the Affected Party,
            respectively, and, if Loss applies and fewer than all the
            Transactions are being terminated, Loss shall be calculated in
            respect of all Terminated Transactions.

            (2) Two Affected Parties. If there are two Affected Parties:-

               (A) if Market Quotation applies, each party will determine a
               Settlement Amount in respect of the Terminated Transactions, and
               an amount will be payable equal to (I) the sum of (a) one-half of
               the difference between the Settlement Amount of the party with
               the higher Settlement Amount ("X") and the Settlement Amount of
               the party with the lower Settlement Amount ("Y") and (b) the
               Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to X
               less (II) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid
               Amounts owing to Y; and

               (B) if Loss applies, each party will determine its Loss in
               respect of this Agreement (or, if fewer than all the Transactions
               are being terminated, in respect of all Terminated Transactions)
               and an amount will be payable equal to one-half of the difference
               between the Loss of the party with the higher Loss ("X") and the
               Loss of the party with the lower Loss ("Y").

          If the amount payable is a positive number, Y will pay it to X; if it
          is a negative number, X will pay the absolute value of that amount to
          Y.

                                       13

     (iii) Adjustment for Bankruptcy. In circumstances where an Early
     Termination Date occurs because "Automatic Early Termination" applies in
     respect of a party, the amount determined under this Section 6(e) will be
     subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by law to
     reflect any payments or deliveries made by one party to the other under
     this Agreement (and retained by such other party) during the period from
     the relevant Early Termination Date to the date for payment determined
     under Section 6(d)(ii)

     (iv)  Pre-Estimate. The parties agree that if Market Quotation applies an
     amount recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable pre-estimate of
     loss and not a penalty. Such amount is payable for the loss of bargain and
     the loss of protection against future risks and except as otherwise
     provided in this Agreement neither party will be entitled to recover any
     additional damages as a consequence of such losses.

7.   Transfer

Subject to Section 6(b)(ii), neither this Agreement nor any interest or
obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of
security or otherwise) by either party without the prior written consent of the
other party, except that:--

(a)  a party may make such a transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a
consolidation or amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all
or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to any
other right or remedy under this Agreement); and

(b)  a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its interest in any
amount payable to it from a Defaulting Party under Section 6(e).

Any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this Section will be void.

8.   Contractual Currency

(a)  Payment in the Contractual Currency. Each payment under this Agreement will
be made in the relevant currency specified in this Agreement for that payment
(the "Contractual Currency"). To the extent permitted by applicable law, any
obligation to make payments under this Agreement in the Contractual Currency
will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency other than the
Contractual Currency, except to the extent such tender results in the actual
receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in a reasonable manner and
in good faith in converting the currency so tendered into this Contractual
Currency, of the full amount in the Contractual Currency of all amounts payable
in respect of this Agreement. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual
Currency so received falls short of the amount in the Contractual Currency
payable in respect of this Agreement, the party required to make the payment
will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately pay such additional
amount in the Contractual Currency as may be necessary to compensate for the
shortfall. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received
exceeds the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this
Agreement, the party receiving the payment will refund promptly the amount of
such excess.

                                       14

<PAGE>

(b)  Judgments. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or
order expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency is rendered
(i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this Agreement, (ii) for
the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this
Agreement or (iii) in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the
payment of any amount described in (i) or (ii) above, the party seeking recovery
in full of the aggregate amount to which such party is entitled pursuant to the
judgment or order, will be entitled to receive immediately from the other party
the amount of any shortfall of the Contractual Currency received by such party
as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency and will refund promptly to
the other party any excess of the Contractual Currency received by such party as
a consequence of sums paid in such other currency if such shortfall or such
excess arises or results from any variation between the rate of exchange at
which the Contractual Currency is converted into the currency of the judgment or
order for the purposes of such judgment or order and the rate of exchange at
which such party is able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in
converting the currency received into the Contractual Currency, to purchase the
Contractual Currency with the amount of the currency of the judgment or order
actually received by such party. The term "rate of exchange" includes, without
limitation, any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the
purchase of or conversion into the Contractual Currency.

(c)  Separate Indemnities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, these
indemnities constitute separate and independent obligations from the other
obligations in this Agreement, will be enforceable as separate and independent
causes of action, will apply notwithstanding any indulgence granted by the party
to which any payment is owed and will not be affected by judgment being obtained
or claim or proof being made for any other sums payable in respect of this
Agreement.

(d)  Evidence of Loss. For the purpose of this Section 8, it will be sufficient
for a party to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an actual
exchange or purchase been made.

the underlying obligation was absolute or contingent and assuming the

a later date that later date, with the Termination Currency at the rate equal to
the spot exchange rate of the foreign exchange agent (selected as provided
below) for the purchase of such Other Currency with the Termination Currency at
or about 11:00 a.m. (in the city in which such foreign exchange agent is
located) on such date as would be customary for the determination of such a rate
for the purchase of such Other Currency for value on the relevant Early
Termination Date or that later date. The foreign exchange agent will, if only
one party is obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e), be selected in
good faith by that party and otherwise will be agreed by the parties.

"Termination Event" means an Illegality, a Tax Event or a Tax Event Upon Merger,
or, if specified to be applicable, a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional
Termination Event.

"Termination Rate" means a rate per annum equal to the arithmetic mean of the
cost (without proof or evidence of any actual cost) to each party (as certified
by such party) if it were to fund or of funding such amounts.

"Unpaid Amounts" owing to any party means, with respect to an Early Termination
Date, the aggregate of (a) in respect of all Terminated Transactions, the
amounts that became payable (or that would have become payable but for Section
2(a)(iii)) to such party under Section 2(a)(i) on or prior to such Early
Termination Date and which remain unpaid as at such Early Termination Date and
(b) in respect of each Terminated Transaction, for each obligation under Section
2(a)(i) which was (or would have been but for Section 2(a)(iii)) required to be
settled by delivery to such party on or prior to such Early Termination Date and
which has not been so settled as at such Early Termination Date, an amount equal
to the fair market value of that which was (or would have been) required to be
delivered as of the originally scheduled date for delivery, in each case
together with (to the extent permitted under applicable law) interest, in the
currency of such amounts, from (and including) the date such amounts or
obligations were or would have been required to have been paid or performed to
(but excluding) such Early Termination Date, at the Applicable Rate. Such
amounts of interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the
actual number of days elapsed. The fair market value of any obligation referred
to in clause (b) above shall be reasonably determined by the party obliged to
make the determination under Section 6(e) or, if each party is so obliged, it
shall be the average of the

                                       23

(a) Set-off. Any amount (the "Early Termination Amount") payable to one party
(the Payee) by the other party (the Payer) under Section 6(e), in circumstances
where there is a Defaulting Party or one Affected Party in the case where a
Termination Event under Section 5(b)(iv) has occurred, will, at the option of
the party ("X") other than the Defaulting Party or the Affected Party (and
without prior notice to the Defaulting Party or the Affected Party), be reduced
by its set-off against any amount(s) payable (whether at such time or in the
future or upon the occurrence of a contingency) by the Payee to the Payer
(irrespective of the currency, place of payment or booking office of the
obligations) under any other agreement(s) between the Payee

                                      -4-

<PAGE>

and the Payer or instrument(s) or undertaking(s) issued or executed by the Payee
to, or in favor of, the Payer (the "Other Amount") and the Early Termination
Amount will be discharged promptly and in all respects to the extent it is so
set-off. X will give notice to the other party of any set-off effected under
this Part 5(a).

For this purpose, either the Early Termination Amount or the Other Amount (or
the relevant portion of such amounts) may be converted by X into the currency in
which the other is denominated at the rate of exchange at which such party would
be able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, to purchase the
relevant amount of such currency.

If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that obligation
and set-off in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting
to the other when the obligation is ascertained. Nothing in this Part 5(a) shall
be effective to create a charge or other security interest.

Except as specified in Part 5(b) below, nothing in this Agreement shall be
treated as restricting or negating any right of set-off, lien, counterclaim or
other right or remedy which might otherwise be available to either party. It is
expressly understood and agreed that the foregoing set-off provisions apply
strictly to and between the parties hereto and do not include obligations or
rights of any Affiliates thereof.

future agreement, except as provided in Part 5(a), Party B irrevocably waives
any and all rights it may have to set-off, net, recoup or otherwise withhold or
suspend or condition payment or performance of (i) any of its obligations
hereunder against any obligation of any Affiliate of Party A to Party B or any
Affiliate of Party B or of Party A to any Affiliate of Party B under any
agreement, course of performance or dealing or otherwise, or (ii) any of its
obligations under any agreement, course of performance or dealing or otherwise
with any Affiliate of Party A against any obligation of Party A hereunder or
under any agreement, course of performance or dealing or otherwise.

(c) Waiver of Set-off. Notwithstanding Section 6(e) or any other existing or
future agreement, except as provided in Part 5(a), Party A irrevocably waives
any and all rights it may have to set-off, net, recoup or otherwise withhold or
suspend or condition payment or performance of (i) any of its obligations
hereunder against any obligation of any Affiliate of Party B to Party A or any
Affiliate of Party A or of Party B to any Affiliate of Party A under any
agreement, course of performance or dealing or otherwise, or (ii) any of its
obligations under any agreement, course of performance or dealing or otherwise
with any Affiliate of Party B against any obligation of Party B hereunder or
under any agreement, course of performance or dealing or otherwise.

(d) Transfer. Notwithstanding Section 7 of this Agreement, if the long term
unsecured and unsubordinated senior debt, counterparty, deposits, claims paying
ability or any equivalent rating of Party B, is rated Baa1 or below by Moody's
Investor Services, Inc. or any successor thereto ("Moody's"), BBB+ or below by
Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or any successor thereto ("S&P") or BBB+ or
below by Fitch Investors Services, L.P. or any successor thereto ("Fitch") (or

request), or if for any reason Party B becomes unrated or any previous rating
(implied, estimated or otherwise) is withdrawn without replacement, then Party A
shall be entitled to elect and if it so elects, the rights and obligations of
Party A under all Transactions hereunder shall, upon written notice to Party B
by either or both of Party A and the parent company of Party A, be assigned and
delegated to, and assumed by, the parent company of Party A, and Party B
expressly and irrevocably consents to such assignment, delegation and assumption
on such terms as are contained in the ISDA Master Agreement in effect between
Party B and the parent company of Party A or, if there is no such Master
Agreement in effect, then on the terms provided in this Agreement, except Part
5(b), 5(d) (except to effect the provisions hereof), and 5(l) hereof and, if
Cross-Default does not apply to Party B hereunder, then Cross-Default shall
apply to the parent company of Party A and Party B, Specified Indebtedness shall
not include obligations in respect of deposits received in the ordinary course
of a party's banking business, and Threshold Amount shall mean the greater of

rights and obligations of Party A under all Transactions hereunder and Party A
shall, without further action, forever be released therefrom (including any
liability for breach thereof).

business days, either confirming agreement thereto or requesting a correction of
any error(s) contained therein. Failure by Party A to send a Confirmation or of
Party B to respond within such period shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of such Transaction. Absent manifest error, there shall be a
presumption that the terms contained in any Confirmation sent by Party A and not
objected to by Party B as provided above are the terms of the Transaction. The
parties agree that any such exchange of telexes or facsimile transmissions shall
constitute a Confirmation for all purposes hereunder.

AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

agrees to the tape recording of conversations between trading and marketing
personnel of the parties to

Dear Sir/Madam,

     The purpose of this letter agreement is to confirm the terms and conditions
of the Transaction entered into between Ventas Finance I, LLC and Banc of
America Financial Products, Inc. (each a "party" and together "the parties") on
the Trade Date specified below (the "Transaction"). This letter agreement
constitutes a "Confirmation" as referred to in the ISDA Master Agreement
specified in paragraph 1 below (the "Agreement").

<PAGE>

     The definitions and provisions contained in the 2000 ISDA Definitions, as
published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (the
"Definitions"), are incorporated into this Confirmation. In the event of any
inconsistency between the Definitions and this Confirmation, this Confirmation
will govern. Each party represents and warrants to the other that (i) it is duly
authorized to enter into this Transaction and to perform its obligations
hereunder and (ii) the person executing this Confirmation is duly authorized to
execute and deliver it.

     In this Confirmation "Party A" means Banc of America Financial Products,
Inc. and "Party B" means Ventas Finance I, LLC.

1. This Confirmation evidences a complete binding agreement between the parties
as to the terms of the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates. In
addition, the parties agree to use all reasonable efforts promptly to negotiate,
execute and deliver an agreement in the form of the ISDA Master Agreement
(Multicurrency-Cross Border) (the "ISDA Form"), with such modifications as the
parties will in good faith agree. Upon the execution by the parties of such an
agreement, this Confirmation will supplement, form a part of, and be subject to
that agreement. All provisions contained or incorporated by reference in that
agreement upon its execution will govern this Confirmation except as expressly
modified below. Until the parties execute and deliver that agreement, this
Confirmation, together with all other documents referring to the ISDA Form (each
a "Confirmation") confirming transactions (each a "Transaction") entered into
between the parties (notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a
Confirmation), shall supplement, form a part of, and be subject to an agreement
in the form of the ISDA Form as if the parties had executed an agreement in such
form (with a Schedule in which the parties elected that the Termination Currency
would be United States Dollars and that the governing law would be New York law
and in which the parties included the following non-negotiable provisions from
Party A's form of Schedule a copy of which has been provided to Party B (which
Party B agrees that it has received and understands): Part 1(a), 5(a), 5(b),
5(c), 5(d), 5(j), and 5(l), but otherwise without any Schedule, on the Trade
Date of the first such Transaction between us. In the event of any inconsistency
between the provisions of that agreement and this Confirmation, this
Confirmation will prevail for the purposes of this Transaction.

2. Notwithstanding Section 7 of this Agreement, Party B acknowledges and agrees
that the parties' failure to execute and deliver an Agreement in a form
acceptable to us within thirty (30) business days of the Trade Date of this
Transaction shall, at Party A's election, (i) constitute an Additional
Termination Event with both parties as Affected Parties and this Transaction as
an Affected Transaction, or (ii) entitle Party A to assign and delegate its
rights and obligations under this Transaction to the parent company of Party A
(the "Parent"), upon written notice to Party B by either or both of Party A and
the Parent, and such Transaction shall be governed by the existing ISDA Master
Agreement, if any, between Party B and the Parent or, in the absence

                                       -2-

<PAGE>

thereof, the ISDA Form (with a Schedule in which the Parent and Party B elected
that the Termination Currency would be United States Dollars and that the
governing law would be New York law). As of and from the date of such
assignment, the Parent shall succeed to all rights and obligations of Party A
under this Transaction and Party A shall, without further action, forever be
released therefrom (including any liability for breach thereof).

For purposes of this transaction only, the provisions of Part 5(d) of the
Schedule to the Master Agreement shall not apply, upon payment in full of all
amounts due and owing by Ventas Finance I, LLC.

     Agreement.

     (iii) Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to (1)
     the condition precedent that no Event of Default or Potential Event of
     Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is continuing, (2)
     the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date in respect of the
     relevant Transaction has occurred or been effectively designated and (3)
     each other applicable condition precedent specified in this Agreement.

(b)  Change of Account. Either party may change its account for receiving a
payment or delivery by giving notice to the other party at least five Local
Business Days prior to the scheduled date for the payment or delivery to which
such change applies unless such other party gives timely notice of a reasonable
objection to such change.

(c)  Netting. If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable:--

     (i)   in the same currency; and

     (ii)  in respect of the same Transaction,

by each party to the other, then, on such date, each party's obligation to make
payment of any such amount will be automatically satisfied and discharged and,
if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one party
exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by the other
party, replaced by an obligation upon the party by whom the larger aggregate
amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the excess of the
larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.

The parties may elect in respect of two or more Transactions that a net amount
will be determined in respect of all amounts payable on the same date in the
same currency in respect of such Transactions, regardless of whether such
amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction. The election may be made
in the Schedule or a Confirmation by specifying that subparagraph (ii) above
will not apply to the Transactions identified as being subject to the election,
together with the starting date (in which case subparagraph (ii) above will not,
or will cease to, apply to such Transactions from such date). This election may
be made separately for different groups of Transactions and will apply
separately to each pairing of Offices through which the parties make and receive
payments or deliveries.

(d)  Deduction or Withholding for Tax.

     (i)   Gross-Up. All payments under this Agreement will be made without any
     deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such deduction
     or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified by the
     practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in effect. If
     a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party ("X") will:--

           (1) promptly notify the other party ("Y") of such requirement;

                                       2

<PAGE>

          (2) pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be
          deducted or withheld (including the full amount required to be
          deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by X to Y under
          this Section 2(d)) promptly upon the earlier of determining that such
          deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such
          amount has been assessed against Y;

          (3) promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a certified copy),
          or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, evidencing such
          payment to such authorities; and

          (4) if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition to the
          payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under this Agreement, such
          additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount
          actually received by Y (free and clear of Indemnifiable Taxes, whether
          assessed against X or Y) will equal the full amount Y would have
          received had no such deduction or withholding been required. However,
          X will not be required to pay any additional amount to Y to the extent
          that it would not be required to be paid but for:--

               (A) the failure by Y to comply with or perform any agreement
               contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d); or

               (B) the failure of a representation made by Y pursuant to Section
               3(f) to be accurate and true unless such failure would not have
               occurred but for (I) any action taken by a taxing authority, or
               brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the
               date on which a Transaction is entered into (regardless of
               whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party
               to this Agreement) or (II) a Change in Tax Law.

     (ii) Liability. If:--

          (1) X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice
          of any relevant governmental revenue authority, to make any deduction
          or withholding in respect of which X would not be required to pay an
          additional amount to Y under Section 2(d)(i)(4);

          (2) X does not so deduct or withhold; and

          (3) a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly against
          X,

     then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies the liability
     resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the amount of such
     liability (including any related liability for interest, but including any
     related liability for penalties only if Y has failed to comply with or
     perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).

(e) Default Interest, Other Amounts. Prior to the occurrence or effective
designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction,
a party that defaults in the performance of any payment obligation will, to the
extent permitted by law and subject to Section 6(c), be required to pay interest
(before as well as after judgment) on the overdue amount

                                       3

<PAGE>

to the other party on demand in the same currency as such overdue amount, for
the period from (and including) the original due date for payment to (but
excluding) the date of actual payment, at the Default Rate. Such interest will
be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days
elapsed. If, prior to the occurrence or effective designation of an Early
Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction, a party defaults in the
performance of any obligation required to be settled by delivery, it will
compensate the other party on demand if and to the extent provided for in the
relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.

3.   Representations

Each party represents to the other party (which representations will be deemed
to be repeated by each party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into
and, in the case of the representations in Section 3(f), at all times until the
termination of this Agreement) that:--

(a)  Basic Representations.

     (i) Status. It is duly organised and validly existing under the laws of the
     jurisdiction of its organisation or incorporation and, if relevant under
     such laws, in good standing;

     (ii) Powers. It has the power to execute this Agreement and any other
     documentation relating to this Agreement to which it is a party, to deliver
     this Agreement and any other documentation relating to this Agreement that
     it is required by this Agreement to deliver and to perform its obligations
     under this Agreement and any obligations it has under any Credit Support
     Document to which it is a party and has taken all necessary action to
     authorise such execution, delivery and performance;

     (iii) No Violation or Conflict. Such execution, delivery and performance do
     not violate or conflict with any law applicable to it, any provision of its
     constitutional documents, any order or judgment of any court or other
     agency of government applicable to it or any of its assets or any
     contractual restriction binding on or affecting it or any of its assets;

     (iv) Consents. All governmental and other consents that are required to
     have been obtained by it with respect to this Agreement or any Credit
     Support Document to which it is a party have been obtained and are in full
     force and effect and all conditions of any such consents have been complied
     with; and

     (v) Obligations Binding. Its obligations under this Agreement and any
     Credit Support Document to which it is a party constitute its legal, valid
     and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their respective
     terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganisation, insolvency,
     moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and
     subject, as to enforceability, to equitable principles of general
     application (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in
     equity or at law)).

(b)  Absence of Certain Events. No Event of Default or Potential Event of
Default or, to its knowledge, Termination Event with respect to it has occurred
and is continuing and no such event or circumstance would occur as a result of
its entering into or performing its obligations under this Agreement or any
Credit Support Document to which it is a party.

                                       4

<PAGE>

(c)  Absence of Litigation. There is not pending or, to its knowledge,
threatened against it or any of its Affiliates any action, suit or proceeding at
law or in equity or before any court, tribunal, governmental body, agency or
official or any arbitrator that is likely to affect the legality, validity or
enforceability against it of this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to
which it is a party or its ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or such Credit Support Document.

(d)  Accuracy of Specified Information. All applicable information that is
furnished in writing by or on behalf of it to the other party and is identified
for the purpose of this Section 3(d) in the Schedule is, as of the date of the
information, true, accurate and complete in every material respect.

(e)  Payer Tax Representation. Each representation specified in the Schedule as
being made by it for the purpose of this Section 3(e) is accurate and true.

(f)  Payee Tax Representations. Each representation specified in the Schedule as
being made by it for the purpose of this Section 3(f) is accurate and true.

4.   Agreements

Each party agrees with the other that, so long as either party has or may have
any obligation under this Agreement or under any Credit Support Document to
which it is a party:--

(a)  Furnish Specified Information. It will deliver to the other party or, in
certain cases under subparagraph (iii) below, to such government or taxing
authority as the other party reasonably directs:--

     (i)   any forms, documents or certificates relating to taxation specified
     in the Schedule or any Confirmation;

     (ii)  any other documents specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation;
     and

     (iii) upon reasonable demand by such other party, any form or document that
     may be required or reasonably requested in writing in order to allow such
     other party or its Credit Support Provider to make a payment under this
     Agreement or any applicable Credit Support Document without any deduction
     or withholding for or on account of any Tax or with such deduction or
     withholding at a reduced rate (so long as the completion, execution or
     submission of such form or document would not materially prejudice the
     legal or commercial position of the party in receipt of such demand), with
     any such form or document to be accurate and completed in a manner
     reasonably satisfactory to such other party and to be executed and to be
     delivered with any reasonably required certification,

in each case by the date specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation or, if
none is specified, as soon as reasonably practicable.

(b)  Maintain Authorisations. It will use all reasonable efforts to maintain in
full force and effect all consents of any governmental or other authority that
are required to be obtained by it

                                       5

<PAGE>

with respect to this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a
party and will use all reasonable efforts to obtain any that may become
necessary in the future.

(c)  Comply with Laws. It will comply in all material respects with all
applicable laws and orders to which it may be subject if failure so to comply
would materially impair its ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party.

(d)  Tax Agreement. It will give notice of any failure of a representation made
by it under Section 3(f) to be accurate and true promptly upon learning of such
failure.

(e) Payment of Stamp Tax. Subject to Section 11, it will pay any Stamp Tax
levied or imposed upon it or in respect of its execution or performance of this
Agreement by a jurisdiction in which it is incorporated, organised, managed and
controlled, or considered to have its seat, or in which a branch or office
through which it is acting for the purpose of this Agreement is located ("Stamp
Tax Jurisdiction") and will indemnify the other party against any Stamp Tax
levied or imposed upon the other party or in respect of the other party's
execution or performance of this Agreement by any such Stamp Tax Jurisdiction
which is not also a Stamp Tax Jurisdiction with respect to the other party.

5.   Events of Default and Termination Events

(a)  Events of Default. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or,
if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity
of such party of any of the following events constitutes an event of default (an
"Event of Default") with respect to such party:--

     (i)   Failure to Pay or Deliver. Failure by the party to make, when due,
     any payment under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e)
     required to be made by it if such failure is not remedied on or before the
     third Local Business Day after notice of such failure is given to the
     party;

     (ii)  Breach of Agreement. Failure by the party to comply with or perform
     any agreement or obligation (other than an obligation to make any payment
     under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) or to give
     notice of a Termination Event or any agreement or obligation under Section
     4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)) to be complied with or performed by the party
     in accordance with this Agreement if such failure is not remedied on or
     before the thirtieth day after notice of such failure is given to the
     party;

     (iii) Credit Support Default.

          (1) Failure by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party
          to comply with or perform any agreement or obligation to be complied
          with or performed by it in accordance with any Credit Support Document
          if such failure is continuing after any applicable grace period has
          elapsed;

                                       6

<PAGE>

          (2) the expiration or termination of such Credit Support Document or
          the failing or ceasing of such Credit Support Document to be in full
          force and effect for the purpose of this Agreement (in either case
          other than in accordance with its terms) prior to the satisfaction of
          all obligations of such party under each Transaction to which such
          Credit Support Document relates without the written consent of the
          other party; or

          (3) the party or such Credit Support Provider disaffirms, disclaims,
          repudiates or rejects, in whole or in part, or challenges the validity
          of, such Credit Support Document;

     (iv)  Misrepresentation. A representation (other than a representation
     under Section 3(e) or (f)) made or repeated or deemed to have been made or
     repeated by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party in this
     Agreement or any Credit Support Document proves to have been incorrect or
     misleading in any material respect when made or repeated or deemed to have
     been made or repeated;

     (v)   Default under Specified Transaction. The party, any Credit Support
     Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party (1)
     defaults under a Specified Transaction and, after giving effect to any
     applicable notice requirement or grace period, there occurs a liquidation
     of, an acceleration of obligations under, or an early termination of, that
     Specified Transaction, (2) defaults, after giving effect to any applicable
     notice requirement or grace period, in making any payment or delivery due
     on the last payment, delivery or exchange date of, or any payment on early
     termination of, a Specified Transaction (or such default continues for at
     least three Local Business Days if there is no applicable notice
     requirement or grace period) or (3) disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or
     rejects, in whole or in part, a Specified Transaction (or such action is
     taken by any person or entity appointed or empowered to operate it or act
     on its behalf);

     (vi)  Cross Default. If "Cross Default" is specified in the Schedule as
     applying to the party, the occurrence or existence of (1) a default, event
     of default or other similar condition or event (however described) in
     respect of such party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any
     applicable Specified Entity of such party under one or more agreements or
     instruments relating to Specified Indebtedness of any of them (individually
     or collectively) in an aggregate amount of not less than the applicable
     Threshold Amount (as specified in the Schedule) which has resulted in such
     Specified Indebtedness becoming, or becoming capable at such time of being
     declared, due and payable under such agreements or instruments, before it
     would otherwise have been due and payable or (2) a default by such party,
     such Credit Support Provider or such Specified Entity (individually or
     collectively) in making one or more payments on the due date thereof in an
     aggregate amount of not less than the applicable Threshold Amount under
     such agreements or instruments (after giving effect to any applicable
     notice requirement or grace period);

     (vii) Bankruptcy. The party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or
     any applicable Specified Entity of such party:--

                                       7

<PAGE>

          (1) is dissolved (other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation
          or merger); (2) becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts or
          fails or admits in writing its inability generally to pay its debts as
          they become due; (3) makes a general assignment, arrangement or
          composition with or for the benefit of its creditors; (4) institutes
          or has instituted against it a proceeding seeking a judgment of
          insolvency or bankruptcy or any other relief under any bankruptcy or
          insolvency law or other similar law affecting creditors' rights, or a
          petition is presented for its winding-up or liquidation, and, in the
          case of any such proceeding or petition instituted or presented
          against it, such proceeding or petition (A) results in a judgment of
          insolvency or bankruptcy or the entry of an order for relief or the
          making of an order for its winding-up or liquidation or (B) is not
          dismissed, discharged, stayed or restrained in each case within 30
          days of the institution or presentation thereof; (5) has a resolution
          passed for its winding-up, official management or liquidation (other
          than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (6) seeks
          or becomes subject to the appointment of an administrator, provisional
          liquidator, conservator, receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar
          official for it or for all or substantially all its assets; (7) has a
          secured party take possession of all or substantially all its assets
          or has a distress, execution, attachment, sequestration or other legal
          process levied, enforced or sued on or against all or substantially
          all its assets and such secured party maintains possession, or any
          such process is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or restrained, in
          each case within 30 days thereafter; (8) causes or is subject to any
          event with respect to it which, under the applicable laws of any
          jurisdiction, has an analogous effect to any of the events specified
          in clauses (1) to (7) (inclusive); or (9) takes any action in
          furtherance of, or indicating its consent to, approval of, or
          acquiescence in, any of the foregoing acts; or

   (viii) Merger Without Assumption. The party or any Credit Support Provider of
   such party consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or
   transfers all or substantially all its assets to, another entity and, at the
   time of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer:--

          (1) the resulting, surviving or transferee entity fails to assume all
          the obligations of such party or such Credit Support Provider under
          this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it or its
          predecessor was a party by operation of law or pursuant to an
          agreement reasonably satisfactory to the other party to this
          Agreement; or

          (2) the benefits of any Credit Support Document fail to extend
          (without the consent of the other party) to the performance by such
          resulting, surviving or transferee entity of its obligations under
          this Agreement.

(b) Termination Events. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or,
if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity
of such party of any event specified below constitutes an Illegality if the
event is specified in (i) below, a Tax Event if the event is specified in (ii)
below or a Tax Event upon Merger if the event is specified in (iii) below, and,
if specified to be applicable, a Credit Event Upon Merger if the event is
specified pursuant

                                       8

<PAGE>

to (iv) below or an Additional Termination Event if the event is specified
pursuant to (v) below:--

     (i) Illegality. Due to the adoption of, or any change in, any applicable
     law after the date on which a Transaction is entered into, or due to the
     promulgation of, or any change in, the interpretation by any court,
     tribunal or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction of any
     applicable law after such date, it becomes unlawful (other than as a result
     of a breach by the party of Section 4(b)) for such party (which will be the
     Affected Party):--

          (1) to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment
          or delivery or to receive a payment or delivery in respect of such
          Transaction or to comply with any other material provision of this
          Agreement relating to such Transaction; or

          (2) to perform, or for any Credit Support Provider of such party to
          perform, any contingent or other obligation which the party (or such
          Credit Support Provider) has under any Credit Support Document
          relating to such Transaction;

     (ii) Tax Event. Due to (x) any action taken by a taxing authority, or
     brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on which
     a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken
     or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (y) a Change in
     Tax Law, the party (which will be the Affected Party) will, or there is a
     substantial likelihood that it will, on the next succeeding Scheduled
     Payment Date (1) be required to pay to the other party an additional amount
     in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in
     respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or (2) receive a
     payment from which an amount is required to be deducted or withheld for or
     on account of a Tax (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e),
     6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) and no additional amount is required to be paid in
     respect of such Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (other than by reason of
     Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B));

     (iii) Tax Event Upon Merger. The party (the "Burdened Party") on the next
     succeeding Scheduled Payment Date will either (1) be required to pay an
     additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section
     2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or
     6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount has been deducted or
     withheld for or on account of any Indemnifiable Tax in respect of which the
     other party is not required to pay an additional amount (other than by
     reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)), in either case as a result of a
     party consolidating or amalgamating with, or merging with or into, or
     transferring all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (which
     will be the Affected Party) where such action does not constitute an event
     described in Section 5(a)(viii);

     (iv) Credit Event Upon Merger. If "Credit Event Upon Merger" is specified
     in the Schedule as applying to the party, such party ("X"), any Credit
     Support Provider of X or any applicable Specified Entity of X consolidates
     or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or
     substantially all its assets to, another entity and such action does not
     constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii) but the
     creditworthiness of the

                                       9

<PAGE>

     resulting, surviving or transferee entity is materially weaker than that of
     X, such Credit Support Provider or such Specified Entity, as the case may
     be, immediately prior to such action (and, in such event, X or its
     successor or transferee, as appropriate, will be the Affected Party); or

     (v) Additional Termination Event. If any "Additional Termination Event" is
     specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying, the occurrence
     of such event (and, in such event, the Affected Party or Affected Parties
     shall be as specified for such Additional Termination Event in the Schedule
     or such Confirmation).

(c) Event of Default and Illegality. If an event or circumstance which would
otherwise constitute or give rise to an Event of Default also constitutes an
Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality and will not constitute an Event
of Default.

6.   Early Termination

(a) Right to Terminate Following Event of Default. If at any time an Event of
Default with respect to a party (the "Defaulting Party") has occurred and is
then continuing, the other party (the "Non-defaulting Party") may, by not more
than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of
Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an
Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions. If, however,
"Automatic Early Termination" is specified in the Schedule as applying to a
party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions
will occur immediately upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an
Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(1), (3), (5), (6) or, to the
extent analogous thereto, (8), and as of the time immediately preceding the
institution of the relevant proceeding or the presentation of the relevant
petition upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default
specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8).

(b) Right to Terminate Following Termination Event.

     (i) Notice. If a Termination Event occurs, an Affected Party will, promptly
     upon becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying the nature of
     that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction and will also give
     such other information about that Termination Event as the other party may
     reasonably require.

     (ii) Transfer to Avoid Termination Event. If either an Illegality under
     Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there is only one Affected
     Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is the
     Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to its right to
     designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv), use all
     reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss,
     excluding immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer within 20 days after
     it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all its rights and obligations under
     this Agreement in respect of the Affected Transactions to another of its
     Offices or Affiliates so that such Termination Event ceases to exist.

                                       10

<PAGE>

     If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give
     notice to the other party to that effect within such 20 day period,
     whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days after
     notice is given under Section 6(b)(i).

     Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject to
     and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party, which
     consent will not be withheld if such other party's policies in effect at
     such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the transferee on
     the terms proposed.

     (iii) Two Affected Parties. If an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a
     Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party will use
     all reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after notice
     thereof is given under Section 6(b)(i) on action to avoid that Termination
     Event.

     (iv) Right to Terminate. If:--

          (1) a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section
          6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected with respect to
          all Affected Transactions within 30 days after an Affected Party gives
          notice under Section 6(b)(i); or

          (2) an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(2), a Credit Event Upon Merger
          or an Additional Termination Event occurs, or a Tax Event Upon Merger
          occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected Party,

     either party in the case of an Illegality, the Burdened Party in the case
     of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party in the case of a Tax Event
     or an Additional Termination Event if there is more than one Affected
     Party, or the party which is not the Affected Party in the case of a Credit
     Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if there is only one
     Affected Party may, by not more than 20 days notice to the other party and
     provided that the relevant Termination Event is then continuing, designate
     a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early
     Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions.

(c) Effect of Designation.

     (i) If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under Section
     6(a) or (b), the Early Termination Date will occur on the date so
     designated, whether or not the relevant Event of Default or Termination
     Event is then continuing.

     (ii) Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination
     Date, no further payments or deliveries under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) in
     respect of the Terminated Transactions will be required to be made, but
     without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement. The amount if
     any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date shall be determined
     pursuant to Section 6(e).

(d) Calculations.

     (i) Statement. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the
     occurrence of an Early Termination Date, each party will make the
     calculations on its part, if any,

                                       11

<PAGE>

     contemplated by Section 6(e) and will provide to the other party a
     statement (1) showing, in reasonable detail, such calculations (including
     all relevant quotations and specifying any amount payable under Section
     6(e)) and (2) giving details of the relevant account to which any amount
     payable to it is to be paid. In the absence of written confirmation from
     the source of a quotation obtained in determining a Market Quotation, the
     records of the party obtaining such quotation will be conclusive evidence
     of the existence and accuracy of such quotation.

     (ii) Payment Date. An amount calculated as being due in respect of any
     Early Termination Date under Section 6(e) will be payable on the day that
     notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early
     Termination Date which is designated or occurs as a result of an Event of
     Default) and on the day which is two Local Business Days after the day on
     which notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early
     Termination Date which is designated as a result of a Termination Event).
     Such amount will be paid together with (to the extent permitted under
     applicable law) interest thereon (before as well as after judgment) in the
     Termination Currency, from (and including) the relevant Early Termination
     Date to (but excluding) the date such amount is paid, at the Applicable
     Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding
     and the actual number of days elapsed.

(e) Payments on Early Termination. If an Early Termination Date occurs, the
following provisions shall apply based on the parties' election in the Schedule
of a payment measure, either "Market Quotation" or "Loss", and a payment method,
either the "First Method" or the "Second Method". If the parties fail to
designate a payment measure or payment method in the Schedule, it will be deemed
that "Market Quotation" or the "Second Method", as the case may be, shall apply.
The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date and
determined pursuant to this Section will be subject to any Set-off.

     (i) Events of Default. If the Early Termination Date results from an Event
     of Default:--

          (1) First Method and Market Quotation. If the First Method and Market
          Quotation apply, the Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting
          Party the excess, if a positive number, of (A) the sum of the
          Settlement Amount (determined by the Non-defaulting Party) in respect
          of the Terminated Transactions and the Termination Currency Equivalent
          of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party over (B) the
          Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the
          Defaulting Party.

          (2) First Method and Loss. If the First Method and Loss apply, the
          Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party, if a positive
          number, the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in respect of this Agreement.

          (3) Second Method and Market Quotation. If the Second Method and
          Market Quotation apply, an amount will be payable equal to (A) the sum
          of the Settlement Amount (determined by the Non-defaulting Party) in
          respect of the Terminated Transactions and the Termination Currency
          Equivalent of the Unpaid

                                       12

<PAGE>

          Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party less (B) the Termination
          Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting
          Party. If that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will
          pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the
          Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of that amount to the
          Defaulting Party.

          (4) Second Method and Loss. If the Second Method and Loss apply, an
          amount will be payable equal to the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in
          respect of this Agreement. If that amount is a positive number, the
          Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a
          negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value
          of that amount to the Defaulting Party.

     (ii) Termination Events. If the Early Termination Date results from a
     Termination Event:--

          (1) One Affected Party. If there is one Affected Party, the amount
          payable will be determined in accordance with Section 6(e)(i)(3), if
          Market Quotation applies, or Section 6(e)(i)(4), if Loss applies,
          except that, in either case, references to the Defaulting Party and to
          the Non-defaulting Party will be deemed to be references to the
          Affected Party and the party which is not the Affected Party,
          respectively, and, if Loss applies and fewer than all the Transactions
          are being terminated, Loss shall be calculated in respect of all
          Terminated Transactions.

          (2) Two Affected Parties. If there are two Affected Parties:

               (A) if Market Quotation applies, each party will determine a
               Settlement Amount in respect of the Terminated Transactions, and
               an amount will be payable equal to (I) the sum of (a) one-half of
               the difference between the Settlement Amount of the party with
               the higher Settlement Amount ("X") and the Settlement Amount of
               the party with the lower Settlement Amount ("Y") and (b) the
               Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to X
               less (II) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid
               Amounts owing to Y; and

               (B) if Loss applies, each party will determine its Loss in
               respect of this Agreement (or, if fewer than all the Transactions
               are being terminated, in respect of all Terminated Transactions)
               and an amount will be payable equal to one-half of the difference
               between the Loss of the party with the higher Loss ("X") and the
               Loss of the party with the lower Loss ("Y").

          If the amount payable is a positive number, Y will pay it to X; if it
          is a negative number, X will pay the absolute value of that amount to
          Y.

     (iii) Adjustment for Bankruptcy. In circumstances where an Early
     Termination Date occurs because "Automatic Early Termination" applies in
     respect of a party, the amount determined under this Section 6(e) will be
     subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by law to
     reflect any payments or deliveries made by one party to the other under
     this Agreement (and retained by such other party) during the period from
     the

                                       13

<PAGE>

     relevant Early Termination Date to the date for payment determined under
     Section 6(d)(ii).

     (iv) Pre-Estimate. The parties agree that if Market Quotation applies an
     amount recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable pre-estimate of
     loss and not a penalty. Such amount is payable for the loss of bargain and
     the loss of protection against future risks and except as otherwise
     provided in this Agreement neither party will be entitled to recover any
     additional damages as a consequence of such losses.

7.   Transfer

Subject to Section 6(b)(ii), neither this Agreement nor any interest or
obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of
security or otherwise) by either party without the prior written consent of the
other party, except that:--

(a) a party may make such a transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a
consolidation or amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all
or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to any
other right or remedy under this Agreement); and

(b) a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its interest in any
amount payable to it from a Defaulting Party under Section 6(e).

Any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this Section will be void.

8.   Contractual Currency

(a) Payment in the Contractual Currency. Each payment under this Agreement will
be made in the relevant currency specified in this Agreement for that payment
(the "Contractual Currency"). To the extent permitted by applicable law, any
obligation to make payments under this Agreement in the Contractual Currency
will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency other than the
Contractual Currency, except to the extent such tender results in the actual
receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in a reasonable manner and
in good faith in converting the currency so tendered into this Contractual
Currency, of the full amount in the Contractual Currency of all amounts payable
in respect of this Agreement. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual
Currency so received falls short of the amount in the Contractual Currency
payable in respect of this Agreement, the party required to make the payment
will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately pay such additional
amount in the Contractual Currency as may be necessary to compensate for the
shortfall. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received
exceeds the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this
Agreement, the party receiving the payment will refund promptly the amount of
such excess.

(b) Judgments. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or
order expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency is rendered
(i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this Agreement, (ii) for
the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this
Agreement or (iii) in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the
payment of any amount described in (i) or (ii) above, the party seeking
recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party is
entitled pursuant

                                       14

<PAGE>

to the judgment or order, will be entitled to receive immediately from the other
party the amount of any shortfall of the Contractual Currency received by such
party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency and will refund
promptly to the other party any excess of the Contractual Currency received by
such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency if such
shortfall or such excess arises or results from any variation between the rate
of exchange at which the Contractual Currency is converted into the currency of
the judgment or order for the purposes of such judgment or order and the rate of
exchange at which such party is able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good
faith in converting the currency received into the Contractual Currency, to
purchase the Contractual Currency with the amount of the currency of the
judgment or order actually received by such party. The term "rate of exchange"
includes, without limitation, any premiums and costs of exchange payable in
connection with the purchase of or conversion into the Contractual Currency.

(c) Separate Indemnities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, these
indemnities constitute separate and independent obligations from the other
obligations in this Agreement, will be enforceable as separate and independent
causes of action, will apply notwithstanding any indulgence granted by the party
to which any payment is owed and will not be affected by judgment being obtained
or claim or proof being made for any other sums payable in respect of this
Agreement.

(d) Evidence of Loss. For the purpose of this Section 8, it will be sufficient
for a party to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an actual
exchange or purchase been made.

9.   Miscellaneous

(a) Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes
all oral communication and prior writings with respect thereto.

(b) Amendments. No amendment, modification or waiver in respect of this
Agreement will be effective unless in writing (including a writing evidenced by
a facsimile transmission) and executed by each of the parties or confirmed by an
exchange of telexes or electronic messages on an electronic messaging system.

(c) Survival of Obligations. Without prejudice to Sections 2(a)(iii) and
6(c)(ii), the obligations of the parties under this Agreement will survive the
termination of any Transaction.

(d) Remedies Cumulative. Except as provided in this Agreement, the rights,
powers, remedies and privileges provided in this Agreement are cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights, powers, remedies and privileges provided by law.

(e) Counterparts and Confirmations.

     (i) This Agreement (and each amendment, modification and waiver in respect
     of it) may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including by
     facsimile transmission), each of which will be deemed an original.

                                       15

<PAGE>

     (ii) The parties intend that they are legally bound by the terms of each
     Transaction from the moment they agree to those terms (whether orally or
     otherwise). A Confirmation shall be entered into as soon as practicable and
     may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including by facsimile
     transmission) or be created by an exchange of telexes or by an exchange of
     electronic messages on an electronic messaging system, which in each case
     will be sufficient for all purposes to evidence a binding supplement to
     this Agreement. The parties will specify therein or through another
     effective means that any such counterpart, telex or electronic message
     constitutes a Confirmation.

(f) No Waiver of Rights. A failure or delay in exercising any right, power or
privilege in respect of this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a
waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will
not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise, of that right,
power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

(g) Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and are not to affect the construction of or to be taken into
consideration in interpreting this Agreement.

10.  Offices; Multibranch Parties

(a) If Section 10(a) is specified in the Schedule as applying, each party that
enters into a Transaction through an Office other than its head or home office
represents to the other party that, notwithstanding the place of booking office
or jurisdiction of incorporation or organisation of such party, the obligations
of such party are the same as if it had entered into the Transaction through its
head or home office. This representation will be deemed to be repeated by such
party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into.

(b) Neither party may change the Office through which it makes and receives
payments or deliveries for the purpose of a Transaction without the prior
written consent of the other party.

(c) If a party is specified as a Multibranch Party in the Schedule, such
Multibranch Party may make and receive payments or deliveries under any
Transaction through any Office listed in the Schedule, and the Office through
which it makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to a Transaction
will be specified in the relevant Confirmation.

11.  Expenses

A Defaulting Party will, on demand, indemnify and hold harmless the other party
for and against all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including legal fees and
Stamp Tax, incurred by such other party by reason of the enforcement and
protection of its rights under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to
which the Defaulting Party is a party or by reason of the early termination of
any Transaction, including, but not limited to, costs of collection.

                                       16

<PAGE>

12.  Notices

(a) Effectiveness. Any notice or other communication in respect of this
Agreement may be given in any manner set forth below (except that a notice or
other communication under Section 5 or 6 may not be given by facsimile
transmission or electronic messaging system) to the address or number or in
accordance with the electronic messaging system details provided (see the
Schedule) and will be deemed effective as indicated:--

     (i)   if in writing and delivered in person or by courier, on the date it
     is delivered;

     (ii)  if sent by telex, on the date the recipient's answerback is received;

     (iii) if sent by facsimile transmission, on the date that transmission is
     received by a responsible employee of the recipient in legible form (it
     being agreed that the burden of proving receipt will be on the sender and
     will not be met by a transmission report generated by the sender's
     facsimile machine);

     (iv)  if sent by certified or registered mail (airmail, if overseas) or the
     equivalent (return receipt requested), on the date that mail is delivered
     or its delivery is attempted; or

     (v)   if sent by electronic messaging system, on the date that electronic
     message is received,

unless the date of that delivery (or attempted delivery) or that receipt, as
applicable, is not a Local Business Day or that communication is delivered (or
attempted) or received, as applicable, after the close of business on a Local
Business Day, in which case that communication shall be deemed given and
effective on the first following day that is a Local Business Day.

(b) Change of Addresses. Either party may by notice to the other change the
address, telex or facsimile number or electronic messaging system details at
which notices or other communications are to be given to it.

13.  Governing Law and Jurisdiction

(a) Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the law specified in the Schedule.

(b) Jurisdiction. With respect to any suit, action or proceedings relating to
this Agreement ("Proceedings"), each party irrevocably:--

     (i) submits to the jurisdiction of the English courts, if this Agreement is
     expressed to be governed by English law, or to the non-exclusive
     jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United States
     District Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City, if
     this Agreement is expressed to be governed by the laws of the State of New
     York; and

     (ii) waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of
     venue of any Proceedings brought in any such court, waives any claim that
     such Proceedings have

                                       17

<PAGE>

     been brought in an inconvenient forum and further waives the right to
     object, with respect to such Proceedings, that such court does not have any
     jurisdiction over such party.

Nothing in this Agreement precludes either party from bringing Proceedings in
any other jurisdiction (outside, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed
by English law, the Contracting States, as defined in Section 1(3) of the Civil
Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 or any modification, extension or
re-enactment thereof for the time being in force) nor will the bringing of
Proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the bringing of
Proceedings in any other jurisdiction.

(c) Service of Process. Each party irrevocably appoints the Process Agent (if
any) specified opposite its name in the Schedule to receive, for it and on its
behalf, service of process in any Proceedings. If for any reason any party's
Process Agent is unable to act as such, such party will promptly notify the
other party and within 30 days appoint a substitute process agent acceptable to
the other party. The parties irrevocably consent to service of process given in
the manner provided for notices in Section 12. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of either party to serve process in any other manner permitted
by law.

(d) Waiver of Immunities. Each party irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, with respect to itself and its revenues and assets
(irrespective of their use or intended use), all immunity on the grounds of
sovereignty or other similar grounds from (i) suit, (ii) jurisdiction of any
court, (iii) relief by way of injunction, order for specific performance or for
recovery of property, (iv) attachment of its assets (whether before or after
judgment) and (v) execution or enforcement of any judgment to which it or its
revenues or assets might otherwise be entitled in any Proceedings in the courts
of any jurisdiction and irrevocably agrees, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, that it will not claim any such immunity in any Proceedings.

the place(s) specified in the relevant Confirmation or, if not so specified, as
otherwise agreed by the parties in writing or determined pursuant to provisions
contained, or incorporated by reference, in this Agreement, (b) in relation to
any other payment, in the place where the relevant account is located and, if
different, in the principal financial centre, if any, of the currency of such
payment, (c) in relation to any notice or other communication, including notice
contemplated under Section 5(a)(i), in the city specified in the address for
notice provided by the recipient and, in the case of a notice contemplated by
Section 2(b), in the place where the relevant new account is to be located and
(d) in relation to Section 5(a)(v)(2), in the relevant locations for performance
with respect to such Specified Transaction.

"Loss" means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated
Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency
Equivalent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith to be its
total losses and costs (or gain, in which case expressed as a negative number)
in connection with this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or group of
Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, including any loss of bargain, cost
of funding or, at the election of such party but without duplication, loss or
cost incurred as a result of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or
reestablishing any hedge or related trading position (or any gain resulting from
any of them). Loss includes losses and costs (or gains) in respect of any
payment or delivery required to have been made (assuming satisfaction of each
applicable condition precedent) on or before the relevant Early Termination Date
and not made, except, so as to avoid duplication, if Section 6(e)(i)(1) or (3)
or 6(e)(ii)(2)(A) applies. Loss does not include a party's legal fees and
out-of-pocket expenses referred to under Section 11. A party will determine its
Loss as of the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if that is not reasonably
practicable, as of the earliest date thereafter as is reasonably practicable. A
party may (but need not) determine its Loss by reference to quotations of
relevant rates or prices from one or more leading dealers in the relevant
markets.

"Market Quotation" means, with respect to one or more Terminated Transactions
and a party making the determination, an amount determined on the basis of
quotations from Reference Market-makers. Each quotation will be for an amount,
if any, that would be paid to such party (expressed as a negative number) or by
such party (expressed as a positive number) in consideration of an agreement
between such party (taking into account any existing Credit Support Document
with respect to the obligations of such party) and the quoting Reference
Market-maker to enter into a transaction (the "Replacement Transaction") that
would have the effect of preserving for such party the economic equivalent of
any payment or delivery (whether the underlying obligation was absolute or
contingent and assuming the satisfaction of each

                                       20

<PAGE>

applicable condition precedent) by the parties under Section 2(a)(i) in respect
of such Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions that would,
but for the occurrence of the relevant Early Termination Date, have been
required after that date. For this purpose, Unpaid Amounts in respect of the
Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions are to be excluded
but, without limitation, any payment or delivery that would, but for the
relevant Early Termination Date, have been required (assuming satisfaction of
each applicable condition precedent) after that Early Termination Date is to be
included. The Replacement Transaction would be subject to such documentation as
such party and the Reference Market-maker may, in good faith, agree. The party
making the determination (or its agent) will request each Reference Market-maker
to provide its quotation to the extent reasonably practicable as of the same day
and time (without regard to different time zones) on or as soon as reasonably
practicable after the relevant Early Termination Date. The day and time as of
which those quotations are to be obtained will be selected in good faith by the
party obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e), and, if each party is
so obliged, after consultation with the other. If more than three quotations are
provided, the Market Quotation will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations,
without regard to the quotations having the highest and lowest values. If
exactly three such quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the
quotation remaining after disregarding the highest and lowest quotations. For
this purpose, if more than one quotation has the same highest value or lowest
value, then one of such quotations shall be disregarded. If fewer than three
quotations are provided, it will be deemed that the Market Quotation in respect
of such Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions cannot be
determined.

"Non-default Rate" means a rate per annum equal to the cost (without proof or
evidence of any actual cost) to the Non-defaulting Party (as certified by it) if

dealers having an office in the same city.

"Relevant Jurisdiction" means, with respect to a party, the jurisdictions (a) in
which the party is incorporated, organised, managed and controlled or considered
to have its seat, (b) where an Office through which the party is acting for
purposes of this Agreement is located, (c) in which the party executes this

is made.

Date, the sum of:--

(b) such party's Loss (whether positive or negative and without reference to any
Unpaid Amounts) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated
Transactions for which a Market Quotation cannot be determined or would not (in
the reasonable belief of the party making the determination) produce a
commercially reasonable result.

applicable Specified Entity of such other party) which is a rate swap
transaction, basis swap, forward rate transaction, commodity swap, commodity

Termination Date (or, if "Automatic Early Termination" applies, immediately
before that Early Termination Date).

"Termination Currency" has the meaning specified in the Schedule.

"Termination Currency Equivalent" means, in respect of any amount denominated in
the Termination Currency, such Termination Currency amount and, in respect of
any amount denominated in a currency other than the Termination Currency (the
"Other Currency"), the amount in the Termination Currency determined by the
party making the relevant determination as being required to purchase such
amount of such Other Currency as at the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if
the relevant Market Quotation or Loss (as the case may be), is determined as of
a later date, that later date, with the Termination Currency at the rate equal
to the spot exchange rate of the foreign exchange agent (selected as provided
below) for the purchase of such Other Currency with the Termination Currency at
or about 11:00 a.m. (in the city in which such foreign exchange agent is
located) on such date as would be customary for the determination of such a rate
for the purchase of such Other Currency for value on the relevant Early
Termination Date or that later date. The foreign exchange agent will, if only
one party is obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e), be selected in
good faith by that party and otherwise will be agreed by the parties.

2(a)(iii)) to such party under Section 2(a)(i) on or prior to such Early
Termination Date and which remain unpaid as at such Early Termination Date and
(b) in respect of each Terminated Transaction, for each obligation under Section
2(a)(i) which was (or would have been but for Section 2(a)(iii)) required to be
settled by delivery to such party on or prior to such Early Termination Date and
which has not been so settled as at such Early Termination Date, an amount equal
to the fair market value of that which was (or would have been) required to be
delivered as of the originally scheduled date for delivery, in each case
together with (to the extent permitted under applicable law) interest, in the
currency of such amounts, from (and including) the date such amounts or
obligations were or would have been required to have been paid or performed to
(but excluding) such Early Termination Date, at the Applicable Rate. Such
amounts of interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the
actual number of days elapsed. The fair market value of any obligation referred
to in clause (b) above shall be reasonably determined by the party obliged to
make the determination under Section 6(e) or, if each party is so obliged, it
shall be the average of the

                                       23

                                    ----------------

(a)  Set-off. Any amount (the "Early Termination Amount") payable to one party
     (the Payee) by the other party (the Payer) under Section 6(e), in
     circumstances where there is a Defaulting Party or one Affected Party in
     the case where a Termination Event under Section 5(b)(iv) or (v) has
     occurred, will, at the option of the party ("X") other than the Defaulting
     Party or the Affected Party (and without prior notice to the Defaulting
     Party or the Affected Party), be reduced by its set-off against any
     amount(s) (the "Other Agreement Amount") payable (whether at such time or
     in the future or upon the occurrence of a contingency) by the Payee to the
     Payer (irrespective of the currency, place of payment or booking office of
     the obligation) under any other agreement(s) between the Payee and the
     Payer or instrument(s) or undertaking(s) issued or executed by one party
     to, or in favor of, the other party (and the Other Agreement Amount will be
     discharged promptly and in all respects to the extent it is so set-off). X
     will give notice to the other party of any set-off effected under this Part
     5(a).

     For this purpose, either the Early Termination Amount or the Other
     Agreement Amount (or the relevant portion of such amounts) may be converted
     by X into the currency in which the other is denominated at the rate of
     exchange at which such party would be able, acting in a reasonable manner
     and in good faith, to purchase the relevant amount of such currency.

     If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that
     obligation and set-off in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant
     party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.

     Nothing in this Part 5(a) shall be effective to create a charge or other
     security interest. This Part 5(a) shall be without prejudice and in
     addition to any right of set-off, combination of accounts, lien or other
     right to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by
     operation of law, contract or otherwise).

(b)  Delivery of Confirmations. For each Transaction entered into hereunder,
     Party A shall promptly send to Party B a Confirmation via facsimile
     transmission. Party B agrees to respond to such Confirmation within five
     (5) Local Business Days, either confirming agreement thereto or requesting
     a correction of any error(s) contained therein. Failure by Party A to send
     a Confirmation or of Party B to respond within such period shall not affect
     the validity or enforceability of such Transaction. Absent manifest error,
     there shall be a presumption that the terms contained in such Confirmation
     are the terms of the Transaction.

(c)  Recording of Conversations. Each party to this Agreement acknowledges and
     agrees to the tape recording of conversations between trading and marketing
     personnel of the parties to this Agreement whether by one or other or both
     of the parties or their agents, and that any such tape recordings may be
     submitted in evidence in any Proceedings relating to the Agreement.

           the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. Section 1a(12)."

(g)  Section 3 is revised so as to add the following Section (g) at the end
     thereof:

     "(g)  Relationship Between Parties. Each party represents to the other
           party and will be deemed to represent to the other party on the date
           on which it enters into a Transaction that (absent a written
           agreement between the parties that expressly imposes affirmative

                 Transaction; it being understood that information and
                 explanations related to the terms and conditions of a
                 Transaction shall not be considered investment advice or a
                 recommendation to enter into that Transaction. Further, such
                 party has not received from the other party any assurance or
                 guarantee as to the expected results of that Transaction.

           (ii)  Evaluation and Understanding. It is capable of evaluating and
                 understanding (on its own behalf or through independent
                 professional advice), and understands and accepts, the terms,

referred to in the ISDA Master Agreement specified in paragraph 1 below (the
"Agreement").

The definitions and provisions contained in the 2000 ISDA Definitions, as
published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., (the

between the parties (notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a
Confirmation), shall supplement, form a part of, and be subject to an agreement
in the form of the ISDA Form as if the parties had executed an agreement in such
form (but without any Schedule) on the Trade Date of the first such Transaction
between the parties. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of
that agreement and this Confirmation, this Confirmation will prevail for the
purpose of this Transaction.

                    FIRST AMENDMENT TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

     This First Amendment to Employment Agreement ("First Amendment") is made as
of this 2nd day of January, 2002 (the "First Amendment Date") by and between
Ventas, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and Brian Wood (the
"Employee"). All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the
respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Original Employment Agreement
(hereinafter defined).

                                    RECITALS

     WHEREAS, the Company and Employee have heretofore entered into that certain

     WHEREAS, the Company and Employee each desire to amend the Original
Employment Agreement as further set forth herein;

     WHEREAS, the Company has determined that it is in the best interests of the
Company to enter into this First Amendment.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the respective
covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound

          ------------  ---------

               ------
     ("Salary"), payable in accordance with the normal payroll procedures of the
     Company and subject to such withholdings and other normal employee
     deductions as may be required by law, at the rate of $200,000 per year.

          "4B. Success Fee Program. In addition to his Salary, Employee shall be
               -------------------
eligible to receive the following success fees, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth below:

          (a)  PETB Success Fee. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
     subsection 4B(a), Employee shall be entitled to one or more success fee(s)
     ("PETB Success Fees") equal to three to five percent (3% to 5%) of all Post
     Emergence Tax Benefits actually received by the Company, whether during or
     after the Term.

               (i)  As used herein, "Post Emergence Tax Benefits" shall mean
          collectively (x) tax escrow funds unconditionally released to the
          Company by the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 3.1(h) of the
                                                         -------------
          Cash Escrow Agreement (the "Cash Escrow Agreement") dated April 21,
          2001 (the "Escrow Fund Benefits"); (y) interest income unconditionally
          distributed to the Company in accordance with the Cash Escrow
          Agreement after (and therefore not including) the 2001 interest income
          distribution to be made in January, 2002 (the "Escrow Interest
          Benefits"); and (z) actual cash taxes saved as a result of Net
          Operating Losses (hereinafter defined) used on the Company's
          consolidated federal income tax returns for the tax years ending
          December 31, 1999, December 31, 2000 and/or December 31, 2001,
          respectively (the "Saved Tax Benefits"). All Post Emergence Tax
          Benefits shall be computed net of any and all out of pocket costs and
          expenses paid or incurred by the Company in connection with the
          receipt of such Post Emergence Tax Benefits (not including any such
          costs or expenses paid out of escrowed funds held under the Cash
          Escrow Agreement). Further, any refund or other tax benefit or
          attribute relating to federal alternative minimum tax received as a
          result of legislation passed after the First Amendment Date shall not
          be deemed a Post Emergence Tax Benefit. As used herein, "Net Operating
          Losses" shall mean the net operating loss carryforwards (within the
          meaning of IRC Section 172) generated and relating to the period
          commencing January 1, 1998 through December 31, 1998 (the "Final
          Pre-Spin Tax Period") that are not utilized through carryback and
          unconditionally survive the final and unappealable conclusion of the
          audit of the Final Pre-Spin Tax Period currently being conducted by
          the Internal Revenue Service.

               (ii) All PETB Success Fees shall be paid to Employee, if relating
          to Escrow Fund Benefits or Escrow Interest Benefits, within forty-five
          (45) days of the date of receipt of such amounts by the Company, as
          applicable, and if relating to Saved Tax Benefits, within ninety (90)
          days after the later of (x) the filing of the Company's consolidated
          federal income tax return claiming the applicable Saved Tax Benefits
          and (y) the final and unconditional conclusion to the audit of the
          Company's consolidated federal income tax return for the year ending
          December 31, 1998 currently being conducted by the Internal Revenue
          Service.

<PAGE>

               (iii) The amount of all PETB Success Fees shall be determined at
          the discretion of the Company within the range of three to five
          percent (3% to 5%) of the applicable Post-Emergence Tax Benefits;
          provided that if either (x) there is a Change of Control of the
          Company (hereinafter defined), or (y) Debra A. Cafaro ceases to be the
          Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the amount of all PETB Success
          Fees payable thereafter shall be equal to five percent (5%) of the
          applicable Post-Emergence Tax Benefits. As used herein, "Change of
          Control" shall mean:

                     (A) An acquisition (other than directly from the Company)
          of any voting securities of the Company (the "Voting Securities") by
          any "Person" (as defined in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Exchange
          Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act)) immediately after which such Person has
          "Beneficial Ownership" (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the
          1934 Act) of 50% or more of the combined voting power of Company's
          then outstanding Voting Securities; provided, however, that in
          determining whether a Change in Control has occurred, Voting
          Securities which are acquired in an acquisition by (I) the Company or
          any of its subsidiaries, (II) an employee benefit plan (or a trust
          forming a part thereof) maintained by the Company or any of its
          subsidiaries or (III) any Person in connection with an acquisition
          referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (I) and (III) shall
          not constitute an acquisition which would cause a Change in Control.

                     (B) The individuals who, as of the date hereof, constituted
          the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Incumbent Board") cease
          for any reason to constitute over 50% of the Board; provided, however,
          that if the election, or nomination for election by the Company's
          stockholders, of any new director was approved by a vote of over 50%
          of the Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of this
          Section, be considered as though such person were a member of the
          Incumbent Board; provided, further, however, that no individual shall
          be considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual
          initially assumed office as a result of either an actual or threatened
          "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11 promulgated under the
          1934 Act) or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or
          consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board of Directors
          of the Company (a "Proxy Contest"), including by reason of any
          agreement intended to avoid or settle any Election Contest or Proxy
          Contest.

                     (C) Consummation of a merger, consolidation or
          reorganization involving the Company, unless each of the following
          events occurs in connection with such merger, consolidation or
          reorganization:

                                       3

<PAGE>


                         (I)   the stockholders of the Company, immediately
          before such merger, consolidation or reorganization, own, directly or
          indirectly immediately following such merger, consolidation or
          reorganization, over 50% of the combined voting power of all voting
          securities of the corporation resulting from such merger or
          consolidation or reorganization (the "Surviving Company") over which
          any Person has Beneficial Ownership in substantially the same
          proportion as their ownership of the Voting Securities immediately
          before such merger, consolidation or reorganization;

                         (II)  the individuals who were members of the Incumbent
          Board immediately prior to the execution of the agreement providing
          for such merger, consolidation or reorganization constitute over 50%
          of the members of the board of directors of the Surviving Company; and

                         (III) no Person (other than the Company, any of its
          subsidiaries, any employee benefit plan (or any trust forming a part
          thereof) maintained by the Company, the Surviving Company or any
          Person who, immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or
          reorganization had Beneficial Ownership of 50% or more of the then
          outstanding Voting Securities) has Beneficial Ownership of 50% or more
          of the combined voting power of the Surviving Company's then
          outstanding voting securities.

                    (D)  Approval by the Company's stockholders of a complete
          liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

                    (E)  Approval by Company's stockholders of an agreement for
          the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
          assets of the Company to any Person (other than a transfer to a
          subsidiary of the Company).

                    (F)  Any other event that the Board shall determine
          constitutes an effective Change in Control of Company.

                    (G)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control
          shall not be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject
          Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the permitted
          amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as a result of the
          acquisition of Voting Securities by the Company which, by reducing the
          number of Voting Securities outstanding, increases the proportional
          number of shares Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person; provided
          that if a Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this
          sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by the
          Company, and after such share acquisition by the Company, the Subject
          Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of any additional Voting
          Securities which increases the percentage of the then outstanding
          Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a
          Change in Control shall occur.

                                       4

          (b) Kindred Stock Success Fees. Employee shall be entitled to receive
     an additional success fee(s) ("Kindred Stock Success Fees") equal to one
     tenth of one percent (1/10/th/ of 1%) of the aggregate capital loss
     carryover from the Company's 1998 consolidated federal income tax return
     (the "1998 Capital Loss Carryover", used on the Company's calendar year
     2001, 2002 and 2003 consolidated federal income tax returns that
     successfully offset the gain on any sale of the Kindred Heathcare, Inc.
     stock owned by the Company. The Company shall be entitled to have any such
     use of the 1998 Capital Loss Carryover reviewed and confirmed by its
     independent tax advisors. All Kindred Stock Success Fees shall be deemed
     owed, and shall be paid to Employee, within ninety (90) days after the
     later of (x) the filing of the applicable tax return on which all or any
     portion of the 1998 Capital Loss Carryover is utilized and (y) the final
     and unconditional conclusion to the audit of the Company's consolidated
     federal income tax return for the tax year ended December 31, 1998,
     currently being conducted by the Internal Revenue Service.

          (c) Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
     this Agreement, the amount of all PETB Success Fees under Section 4B(a) and

disclosure will constitute a breach of trust and cause irreparable injury or
harm to the Company and to its strategic and competitive position. It is
essential to the protection of the Company's business and good will and to the
maintenance of the Company's strategic and competitive position that the
Confidential Information be kept secret and confidential and that Consultant not

Company the opportunity and cooperates with the Company in any efforts by the
Company to limit the scope of such obligation and/or to obtain confidential
treatment of any material disclosed pursuant to such obligation).

                  For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Confidential

proprietary information of the Company in the Consultant's possession.

         (e) ACKNOWLEDGMENT: The Consultant acknowledges and confirms that (i)
the restrictive covenants contained in this Section 9 are reasonably necessary
to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company, and (ii) the
restrictions contained in this Section 9 (including without limitation the
length of the term of the provisions of this Section 9) are not overbroad,
overlong, or unfair and are not the result of overreaching, duress or coercion
of any kind. The Consultant further acknowledges and confirms that its full,
uninhibited and faithful observance of each of the covenants contained in this
Section 9 will not cause it any undue hardship, financial or otherwise, and that
enforcement of each of the covenants contained herein will not impair its
ability to obtain employment commensurate with its abilities and on terms fully
acceptable to it or otherwise to obtain income required for the satisfaction of
the needs of its creditors. The Consultant acknowledges and confirms that its
special knowledge of the business of the Company is such as would cause the
Company serious injury or loss if it were to use such ability and knowledge to
the benefit of a competitor or were to compete with the Company in violation of
the terms of this Section 9. The Consultant further acknowledges that the
restrictions contained in this Section 9 are intended to be, and shall be, for
the benefit of and shall be enforceable by, the Company's successors and
assigns.

                                       6

Section 9 within the jurisdiction of such court, such provision shall be
interpreted and enforced as if it provided for the maximum restriction permitted
under such governing law.

         (g) SURVIVAL: The provisions of this Section 9 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, as applicable.

         (h) INJUNCTION: It is recognized and hereby acknowledged by the parties
hereto that a breach by the Consultant of any of the covenants contained in this
Section 9 will cause irreparable harm and damage to the Company, the monetary
amount of which may be virtually impossible to ascertain. As a result, the
Consultant recognizes and hereby acknowledges that the Company shall be entitled
to an injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining and
restraining any violation of any or all of the covenants contained in this
Section 9 by the Consultant or any of its affiliates, associates, partners or
agents, either directly or indirectly, and that such right to injunction shall
be cumulative and in addition to whatever other remedies the Company may
possess.

1    As a result of the May 1, 1998 spin-off, the Company is deemed to have
     commenced operations on May 1, 1998.

2    The Company considers funds from operations ("FFO") an appropriate measure
     of performance of an equity REIT and the Company uses the National
     Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' ("NAREIT") definition of FFO.
     NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with accounting
     principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), excluding
     gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus depreciation for
     real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships
     and joint ventures. FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to
     FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all
     real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered
     as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an
     indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to
     cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as
     a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO indicative of sufficient
     cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs.

3    Normalized FFO in 2001 excludes the gain on sale of Kindred common stock.

Dividend Policy
Cash dividends of $0.29 per share were paid in the first quarter of 2001 for the
2000 tax year. Aggregate dividends of $0.92 per share were paid for the 2001 tax
year. A cash dividend of $0.22 per share was paid in the second, third and
fourth quarters of 2001 for the 2001 tax year. Dividends of $0.26 per share were
paid in the first quarter of 2002 for the 2001 tax year through a distribution
of approximately $824,000 in cash and 334,886 shares of common stock that the
Company owned in its primary tenant, Kindred Healthcare, Inc. ("Kindred").

As previously announced, we expect to pay total dividends to our stockholders
for 2002 of $0.95 per share, consistent with our intention to distribute 90% or
more of our taxable net income to our stockholders (the "Distribution Policy").
We expect dividends will be paid quarterly, in cash, although we reserve the
right to pay dividends by distributing a combination of cash and other property
or securities, including Kindred common stock. A number of factors are
considered by our Board of Directors when making the final determination
regarding the frequency and amount of our dividends. Therefore, there can be no
assurance that we will maintain this Distribution Policy or that our ability to
pay dividends will not be limited by the terms of our Credit Agreement (as
defined below). See "Note 5 - Borrowing Arrangements" to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Please refer to our Cautionary Statements contained
elsewhere in this Annual Report and the Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, for a description of other factors that may
affect our Distribution Policy.

Beginning with the first quarterly dividend for 2002, Ventas stockholders may
reinvest all or a portion of any cash distribution on their shares of Ventas
Common Stock by participating in the Company's Dividend Reinvestment and Stock
Purchase Plan.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

The following discussion and analysis provides information which management
believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company's
consolidated results of operations and financial condition. This discussion
should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the
notes thereto.

Cautionary Statements

This Annual Report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act"). All statements regarding Ventas and its subsidiaries' expected future
financial position, results of operations, cash flows, funds from operations,
dividends and dividend plans, financing plans, business strategy, budgets,
projected costs, capital expenditures, competitive positions, growth
opportunities, expected lease income, continued qualification as a real estate
investment trust ("REIT"), plans and objectives of management for future
operations and statements that include words such as "anticipate," "if,"
"believe," "plan," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "could," "should,"
"will," and other similar expressions are forward-looking statements. Such
forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and stockholders must
recognize that actual results may differ from the Company's expectations. The
Company does not undertake a duty to update such forward-looking statements.

Actual future results and trends for the Company may differ materially depending
on a variety of factors discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). Factors that may affect the plans or
results of the Company include, without limitation, (a) the ability and
willingness of Kindred and certain of its affiliates to continue to meet and/or
honor its obligations under its contractual arrangements with the Company and
the Company's subsidiaries, including without limitation the lease agreements
and various agreements (the "Spin Agreements") entered into by the Company and
Kindred at the time of the Company's spin-off of Kindred on May 1, 1998 (the
"1998 Spin Off") as such agreements may have been amended and restated in
connection with Kindred's emergence from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001 (the
"Kindred Effective Date"), (b) the ability and willingness of Kindred to
continue to meet and/or honor its obligation to indemnify and defend the Company
for all litigation and other claims relating to the healthcare operations and
other assets and liabilities transferred to Kindred in the 1998 Spin Off, (c)
the ability of Kindred and the Company's other operators to maintain the
financial strength and liquidity necessary to satisfy their respective
obligations and duties under the leases and other agreements with the Company,
and their existing credit agreements, (d) the Company's success in implementing
its business strategy, (e) the nature and extent of future competition, (f) the
extent of future healthcare reform and regulation, including cost containment
measures and changes in reimbursement policies and procedures, (g) increases in
the cost of borrowing for the Company, (h) the ability of the Company's
operators to deliver high quality care and to attract patients, (i) the results
of litigation affecting the Company, (j) changes in general economic conditions
and/or economic conditions in the markets in which the Company may, from time to
time, compete, (k) the ability of the Company to pay down, refinance,
restructure, and/or extend its indebtedness as it becomes due, (l) the movement
of interest rates and the resulting impact on the value of the Company's
interest rate swap agreements and the ability of the Company to satisfy its
obligation under one of these agreements to post cash collateral if required to
do so, (m) the ability and willingness of Atria, Inc. ("Atria") to continue to
meet and honor its contractual arrangements with the Company and Ventas Realty
entered into connection with the Company's spin-off of its assisted living
operations and related assets and liabilities to Atria in August 1996, (n) the
ability and willingness of the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT
due to economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations, including without
limitation, the Company's failure to qualify as a REIT due to its ownership of
Kindred common stock, (o) the outcome of the audit being conducted by the
Internal Revenue Service for the Company's tax years ended December 31, 1997 and
1998, (p) final determination of the Company's taxable net income for the year
ended December 31, 2001, (q) the ability and willingness of the Company's
tenants to renew their leases with the Company upon expiration of the leases and
the Company's ability to relet its properties on the same or better terms in the
event such leases expire and are not renewed by the existing tenants and (r) the
limitations on the ability of the Company to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose
of its common stock in Kindred arising out of the securities laws and the
registration rights agreement the Company entered into with Kindred and certain
of the holders of the Kindred common stock. Many of such factors are beyond the
control of the Company and its management.

Introduction to Our Business

The Company owns a geographically diverse portfolio of healthcare related
facilities, including hospitals, nursing facilities and personal care
facilities, that it leases to third parties. Substantially all of the Company's
revenues are derived from five master leases with Kindred (the "Master Leases").
As a result, the Company's financial condition and results of operations are
dependent on the financial condition and results of operations of Kindred, which
emerged from bankruptcy in April of 2001.

                                                                         Page 19

<PAGE>
Ventas, Inc. Annual Report 2001


The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), beginning with the tax year ended December 31,
1999. As a result, for so long as Ventas continues to satisfy the requirements
for qualification as a REIT, including the distribution of 90% of taxable net
income to its stockholders, it will not be subject to federal income taxation on
the income so distributed.

Portfolio Overview
The following information as of December 31, 2001 provides an overview of the
Company's portfolio of healthcare properties, which primarily includes skilled
nursing facilities and hospitals operated by Kindred. See "Note 4 -
Concentration of Credit Risk" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(a)  Includes (i) revenue of $1.7 million related to the amortization of

     common stock and the amortization of the deferred revenue recorded from the
     receipt of $4.5 million of additional future rents under the leases with
     Kindred, (ii) $0.2 million from subleases under the Master Leases, and
     (iii) four months of Kindred revenue under the Rent Stipulation.

In addition to the diversification of lease rental revenues from the geographic
diversification of the portfolio, the majority of the Company's facilities are
located in states that have certificate of need ("CON") requirements. Certain
states require state approval for development and expansion of healthcare
facilities and services, including findings of need for additional or expanded
healthcare facilities or services. A CON, which is issued by governmental
agencies with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities, is at times required for
expansion of existing facilities, construction of new facilities, addition of
beds, acquisition of major items of equipment or introduction of new services.
The CON rules and regulations may restrict an operator's ability to expand the
Company's properties in certain circumstances.

Results of Operations

The Company elected to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the
year ended December 31, 1999. The Company believes that it has satisfied the
requirements to continue to qualify as a REIT for the years ended December 31,
2000 and 2001. The Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal
income tax purposes for the year ended December 31, 2002 and subsequent years.
It is possible that economic, market, legal tax or other considerations may
cause the Company to fail, or elect not to, continue to qualify as a REIT. The
Company's failure to continue to qualify as a REIT could have a material adverse
effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity
of the Company, on the Company's ability to service its indebtedness and other
obligations and on the Company's ability to make distributions to its
stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT (a "Material Adverse
Effect").

Years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000

Net of total write-offs, rental revenue was essentially unchanged in 2001
compared to 2000, increasing $0.6 million in 2001 from 2000. Rental income for
the year ended December 31, 2001 was $185.2 million, of which $182.9 million
(98.8%) resulted from leases with Kindred. The rental income from Kindred
includes $1.7 million related to the amortization of deferred revenue recorded
as a result of Ventas Realty's receipt of the Kindred common stock and the $4.5
million of additional future rent under the Amended Master Leases. Net rental
income for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $184.5 million, of which $181.7
million (98.5%) resulted from leases with Kindred. In 2000, the outcome of the
Kindred bankruptcy was uncertain, and the difference between the rent provided
for in the five master leases in effect at that time (the "Prior Master Leases")
and rent actually received from Kindred was written off to uncollectible rent
expense. Kindred's plan of reorganization (the "Kindred Reorganization Plan")
terminated the Company's right to the payment of the difference between rent
required to be paid under the terms of the Prior Master Leases and the rent
received by the Company after the date that Kindred filed for protection under
chapter 11 of title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") and prior
to the beginning of the month immediately following the Kindred Effective
Date. As a result, for the period from January 1, 2001 through April 30, 2001,
the Company recorded revenue equal to the amount actually paid by Kindred under
the Rent Stipulation. The Company included in its revenue computation for the
period May 1, 2001 through December 31, 2001 the amount of rent due and payable
under the Master Leases for that period.

Interest and other income totaled approximately $4.0 million and $9.5 million
for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in
interest was primarily the result of lower cash balances during the year as well
as reduced market interest rates.

Expenses totaled $150.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and
included $42.0 million of depreciation expense on real estate assets, $87.0
million of interest on the Credit Agreement and other debt and $4.6 million
interest on the settlement of certain claims with the United States under the
Kindred Reorganization Plan (the "United States Settlement"). For the year ended
December 31, 2000 expenses totaled $304.5 million and included $42.2 million of
depreciation expense on real estate assets and $95.3 million of interest on the
Credit Agreement and other debt. The $154.2 million decrease in expenses in 2001
was due primarily to (a) a charge in 2000 of $96.5 million related to the United
States Settlement, (b) a charge to earnings in 2000 of $48.3 million for unpaid
rent from tenants, which primarily includes the difference between the minimum
monthly base rent that would have been due under the terms of the Prior Master
Leases and the base rent that was paid under the terms of the rent stipulation
entered into in connection with the Kindred bankruptcy, (c) decreased interest
expense and (d) decreased professional fees.

In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a $96.5 million charge
related to the United States Settlement. Under the United States Settlement, the
Company will pay $103.6 million to the federal government, of which $34.0
million was paid on the Kindred Effective Date. The balance of $69.6 million
bears interest at 6% per annum and is payable in equal quarterly installments
over a five-year term commencing on June 30, 2001. The charge for the United
States Settlement was discounted for accounting purposes based on an imputed
borrowing rate of 10.75%.

                                                                         Page 21

Ventas, Inc. Annual Report 2001


Professional fees totaled approximately $4.7 million for the year ended December
31, 2001, as compared to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The
decrease relates primarily to the reduction in professional fees incurred as a
result of Kindred's emergence from bankruptcy. See "Note 4 - Concentration of
Credit Risk" and "Note 9 - Transactions with Kindred" to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Interest expense, excluding the interest on the United States Settlement,
decreased $8.3 million to $87.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001
from $95.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease is
primarily a result of reduced principal, reduced amortization of deferred
financing fees and the favorable impact in the first quarter of 2001 of timing
differences in the rate setting under the Company's interest rate swap agreement
and the Credit Agreement. See "Note 5 - Borrowing Arrangements" to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2001,
interest expense includes a $13.8 million payment on the 1998 Swap Agreement (as
defined below). For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company received
payments of totaling $4.3 million related to the 1998 Swap, which offset
interest expense.

The Internal Revenue Service is currently reviewing the federal income tax
returns of the Company for tax years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998. There can
be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of these matters or whether such
outcome will have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. However, the
resulting tax liabilities, if any, for the tax years ended December 31, 1997 and
1998 will be satisfied first from the use of Net Operating Loss ("NOL")
carryforwards (including the NOL carryforwards that were utilized to offset the
Company's federal income tax liability for 1999 and 2000).

As a result of the uncertainties relating to the Company's ability to retain its
NOL's, the Company recorded a charge for taxes on the 10% of its estimated 2001
taxable income which the Company did not distribute as a dividend. The $2.7
million tax provision reported for the year ended December 31, 2001 included a
$0.7 million provision related to Ventas Realty's receipt of the Kindred common
stock, of which 100% was taxable income to the Company in the second quarter of
2001. See "Note 8 - Income Taxes" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company disposed of 418,186 shares of Kindred common stock in the fourth
quarter of 2001 and recognized a gain of $15.4 million on the dispositions. In
connection with a registered offering of common stock by Kindred, Ventas Realty
exercised its piggyback registration rights, and sold 83,300 shares of Kindred
common stock, recognizing a gain of $2.6 million. The Company applied the net
proceeds of $3.6 million from the sale of the 83,300 shares of Kindred common
stock as a prepayment on the Company's indebtedness under the Credit Agreement.
The Company distributed 334,886 shares of Kindred common stock as part of the
2001 dividend, resulting in a gain of $12.8 million. For every share of common
stock of the Company that a stockholder owned at the close of business on
December 14, 2001, the stockholder received 0.005 of a share of Kindred common
stock and $0.0049 in cash (equating to one share of Kindred common stock and
$0.98 in cash for every two hundred shares of common stock in the Company). For
purposes of the 2001 dividend, the Kindred common stock was valued in accordance
with the Code and applicable rulings and regulations on December 31, 2001 at
$51.02 per share.

In connection with the refinancing of a portion of its indebtedness under the
Credit Agreement, in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company incurred an
extraordinary loss of approximately $1.3 million related to the partial
write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the Credit
Agreement. During the first quarter of 2000, the Company incurred an
extraordinary loss of $4.2 million relating to the write-off of the unamortized
deferred financing costs associated with the Prior Credit Agreement. See "Note 5
- - Borrowing Arrangements" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $50.6 million or $0.73 per
diluted share after an extraordinary loss of $1.3 million (or $0.02 per share).
After an extraordinary loss of $4.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share, as
discussed above, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $65.5
million or $0.96 per diluted share.

Years ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999
Gross rental income for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $232.8 million, of
which $229.6 million (98.6%) was from leases with Kindred, an increase of $4.2
million (1.8%) from rental income for the year ended December 31, 1999 of $228.6
million, of which $225.1 million (98.5%) resulted from leases with Kindred. The
increase in rental income was offset by a $13.9 million increase in charges for
unpaid rents from tenants discussed below. Interest and other income totaled
approximately $9.5 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31,
2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in interest was primarily the result
of earnings from investment of larger cash reserves during the year as well as
higher interest rates and interest received from taxing authorities.

Expenses totaled $304.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and
included $42.2 million of depreciation expense on real estate assets and $95.3
million of interest on the Credit Agreement and other debt. For the year ended
December 31, 1999 expenses totaled $190.7 million and included $42.7 million of
depreciation expense on real estate assets and $88.8 million of interest on the
Prior Credit Agreement and other debt. The $113.8 million increase in expenses
was due primarily to (a) a charge in 2000 of $96.5 million related to the United
States Settlement, (b) an increased charge to earnings in 2000 of $48.3 million
for unpaid rent from tenants (versus $34.4 million in the same

period in the prior year), which primarily includes the difference between the
minimum monthly base rent that would have been due under the terms of the Prior
Master Leases and the base rent that was paid under the terms of the rent
stipulation entered into in connection with Kindred's bankruptcy, (c) increased
interest expense and (d) increased general and administrative expenses.

The loss on uncollectible rent increased for the year ended December 31, 2000 to
$48.3 million from $34.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Under the
Kindred Reorganization Plan, the Company waived its right to the payment of (a)
$18.9 million for the August 1999 monthly base rent under the Prior Master
Leases, and (b) the difference between the rent required to be paid under the
terms of the Prior Master Leases and the rent received by the Company under the
rent stipulation after the date Kindred filed for bankruptcy protection until
the first day of the month immediately following the Kindred Effective Date. As
a result of delays in the extended Kindred bankruptcy proceeding and the
determination that such an amount was uncollectible, the Company wrote off
approximately $48.3 million and $34.4 million of rents receivable from tenants
for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The write-off
consists of the following:

====================================================================================
</TABLE>

For the year ended December 31, 2000, interest expense increased 7.4% to $95.3
million from $88.8 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase
is due primarily to the higher interest rates under the Credit Agreement. The
increase was offset in part by the reduced principal amount ($886.4 million and
$974.2 million as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively) and reduced
amortization of deferred financing fees. For the year ended December 31, 2000,
deferred financing fees were $3.2 million compared to $6.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 1999. Included in the 1999 deferred financing was $1.6
million of amortization for fees incurred in the fourth quarter of 1999 related
to the extension of the maturity of the $275.0 million bridge loan facility from
October 30, 1999 to February 28, 2000.

General and administrative expenses increased 24.4% to $9.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2000 from $7.8 million in the prior year. The increase is
primarily attributed to (a) federal, state and local tax contingencies arising
from and prior to the 1998 Spin Off, (b) compensation expense, (c) insurance and
(d) public company expense. The increase was offset by reductions in federal
excise tax.

Professional fees totaled approximately $10.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000, as compared to $12.5 million for the year ended December 31,
1999. The decrease relates primarily to the reduction in unusual professional
fees ($8.4 million in 2000 and $10.7 million in 1999) incurred as a result of
ongoing reorganization negotiations with Kindred. Fees incurred in the third and
fourth quarter of 1999 were significant in connection with Kindred's bankruptcy
filing and in connection with the Company's business strategy alternatives.

During the first quarter of 2000, the Company incurred an extraordinary loss of
approximately $4.2 million related to the write-off of the unamortized deferred
financing fees associated with the Prior Credit Agreement. See "Note 5 -
Borrowing Arrangements" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company sold a 99-bed nursing facility in
Toledo, Ohio, and a 120-bed facility in Grayling, Michigan, which were leased
and operated by third party tenants. A net gain from the disposition of these
facilities was recorded for $1.0 million. In September of 1999, the Company
realized a gain of approximately $0.3 million on the sale of a tract of land
pursuant to a pre-existing option.

After extraordinary expenses of $4.2 million, or $0.06 per share and the impact
of the United States Settlement, as discussed above, net loss for the year ended
December 31, 2000 was $65.5 million or $0.96 per diluted share. Net income for
the year ended December 31, 1999 was $42.5 million or $0.63 per diluted share.

During the fourth quarter of 1999, a tenant at one of the Company's facilities
ceased paying rent on the facility leased by it and filed for protection under
the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Company deemed the asset to be impaired
and recorded an impairment loss of $1.9 million to write down the asset to its
estimated fair value as of December 31, 1999.

The Company incurred $0.4 million and $1.3 million in non-recurring employee
severance costs in the first quarter of 2000 and 1999.

Ventas, Inc. Annual Report 2001


In connection with the Company's 1998 Spin Off and the consummation of the Prior
Credit Agreement, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with
a highly-rated counterparty (on a notional amount of $850.0 million at December
31, 2000) (the "1998 Swap") to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on
the Company's floating rate debt. On August 4, 1999, the Company entered into an
agreement with the 1998 Swap counterparty to shorten the maturity of the 1998
Swap from December 31, 2007 to June 30, 2003, in exchange for a payment in 1999
from the counterparty to the Company of $21.6 million. So long as the Company
has floating rate debt in excess of $750.0 million, the Company will amortize
the $21.6 million payment for financial accounting purposes in future periods
beginning in July 2003 and ending in December 2007. On January 31, 2000, the
Company further amended the 1998 Swap, pursuant to which the parties agreed, for
purposes of certain calculations set forth in the 1998 Swap, to continue to use
certain defined terms set forth in the Prior Credit Agreement. The Company paid
$6.4 million in 1999 related to the 1998 Swap agreement which is included in
interest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company received
$4.3 million related to the 1998 Swap which is included in interest expense.

Funds from Operations
Funds from operations ("FFO") for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999 totaled $93.5 million, $76.5 million and $85.0 million, respectively. Net
of the gain on the disposition and sale of Kindred common stock, FFO for the
year ended December 31, 2001 was $78.1 million. FFO for the years ended December
31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 is summarized in the following table:

The Company considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity
REIT and the Company uses the NAREIT definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as
net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from
sales of real estate property, plus depreciation for real estate assets, and
after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO
presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real
estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same
definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income
(determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial
performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities
(determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity,
nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the
Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear
understanding of its consolidated historical operating results, FFO should be
examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the Consolidated
Financial Statements and data included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Normalized FFO is FFO excluding the gain on sale of Kindred common stock.

Asset/Liability Management
Asset/liability management is a key element of the Company's overall risk
management program. The objective of asset/liability management is to support
the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk
levels. The asset/liability management process focuses on a variety of risks,
including market risk (primarily interest rate risk) and credit risk. Effective
management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and
variability of FFO and net worth. The following discussion addresses the
Company's integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of
derivative financial instruments. The Company does not use derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes.

Market Risk
The following discussion of the Company's exposure to various market risks
contains "forward-looking statements" that involve risks and uncertainties.
These projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions
considered reasonable in light of information currently available to the
Company. Nevertheless, because of the inherent unpredictability of interest
rates as well as other factors, actual results could differ materially from
those projected in such forward-looking information.

The Company earns revenue by leasing its assets under leases that primarily are
long-term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with
annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. The Company's debt
obligations are floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related
monthly interest

                                                 Ventas, Inc. Annual Report 2001

payments vary with the movement in LIBOR. See "Note 5 -Borrowing Arrangements"
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The general fixed nature of the
Company's assets and the variable nature of the Company's debt obligations
creates interest rate risk. If interest rates were to rise significantly, the
Company's lease revenue might not be sufficient to meet its debt obligations. In
order to mitigate this risk, in connection with the 1998 Spin Off and the
consummation of the Prior Credit Agreement, the Company entered into the 1998
Swap to effectively convert most of its floating rate debt obligations to fixed
rate debt obligations. Interest rate swaps generally involve the exchange of
fixed and floating rate interest payments on an underlying notional amount. As
of December 31, 2001, the Company had an $800.0 million interest rate swap
outstanding with a highly rated counterparty in which the Company pays a fixed
rate of 5.985% and receives LIBOR from the counterparty.

The 1998 Swap originally was in a notional amount of $1.0 billion and would have
expired in varying amounts on December 31 of each year through December 31,
2007. On August 4, 1999, the Company entered into an agreement with the 1998
Swap counterparty to shorten the maturity of the 1998 Swap from December 31,
2007 to June 30, 2003, in exchange for a payment from the counterparty to the
Company of $21.6 million. The notional amount of the 1998 Swap is scheduled to
decline from $800.0 million as of December 31, 2001 as follows:

Notional Amount                                                            Date
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$775,000,000                                                  December 31, 2002
 --                                                               June 30, 2003

The terms of the 1998 Swap require that the Company make a cash deposit or
otherwise post collateral to the counterparty if the fair value loss to the
Company exceeds certain levels (the "threshold levels"). The threshold levels
vary based on the relationship between the Company's debt obligations and the
tangible fair value of its assets as defined in the Prior Credit Agreement. As
of December 31, 2001, the Company believes that the threshold level under the
1998 Swap was a fair value unrealized loss of $35.0 million and the 1998 Swap
was in an unrealized loss position to the Company of $36.4 million. As of
December 31, 2001, the Company was required to have collateral posted under the
1998 Swap of $1.4 million. The $7.7 million letter of credit posted as
collateral under the 1998 Swap on December 31, 2001 was reduced to $1.4 million
on January 2, 2002. Generally, once the fair value loss exceeds the applicable
threshold level, collateral is either posted by the Company or returned to the
Company if the value of the 1998 Swap fluctuates by $2.0 million from the value
on the last date that a counterparty demands collateral be posted or refunded,
as applicable. Under the 1998 Swap, if collateral must be posted, the principal
amount of such collateral must equal the difference between the fair value
unrealized loss of the 1998 Swap at the time of such determination and the
threshold level. If the 1998 Swap continues to decline in value, the Company
will have to post additional collateral in the form of cash, letter of credit or
other permitted credit support. The Company is permitted to issue up to $15.0
million in principal amount of letters of credit under the $25.0 million
revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement. If the Company should be
required to post additional collateral under the 1998 Swap, the Company expects
to post such additional collateral in the form of cash from cash reserves, cash
flows from operations, and/or draws on the Company's revolving credit facility
under the Credit Agreement up to the principal amount of $15.0 million, net of
outstanding letters of credit. However, there can be no assurance that the
Company will have sufficient cash to post such additional collateral, if
required. On January 31, 2000, the Company entered into a letter agreement with
the counterparty to the 1998 Swap for the purpose of amending the 1998 Swap. The
letter agreement provides that, for purposes of certain calculations set forth
in the 1998 Swap, the parties agree to continue to use certain defined terms set
forth in the Prior Credit Agreement. See "Note 5 -Borrowing Arrangements -
Derivatives and Hedging" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

On September 28, 2001, the Company entered into a second interest rate swap
agreement (the "2003-2008 Swap") with a highly rated counterparty to hedge
floating rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008, under
which the Company pays a fixed rate of 5.385% and receives LIBOR from the
counterparty to this agreement. The 2003 - 2008 Swap is treated as a cash flow
hedge for accounting purposes. There are no collateral requirements under the
2003 - 2008 Swap. The notional amount of the 2003 - 2008 Swap is scheduled to
decline from $450 million as of July 1, 2003 as follows:

Notional Amount                                                            Date

In accordance with the terms of the CMBS Loan Agreement (as defined below), on
December 11, 2001, Ventas Finance I, LLC, an indirect wholly owned consolidated
subsidiary of the Company ("Ventas Finance") purchased an interest rate cap from
a highly rated counterparty (the "Buy Cap"). See " - Liquidity and Capital
Resources - Credit Facility" and "Note 5 - Borrowing Arrangements" to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Because the Company already hedged its
consolidated interest rate risk through the 1998 Swap and the 2003 - 2008 Swap,
on December 11, 2001 the Company sold an interest rate cap (the "Sell Cap") for
the same notional value ($225 million) and

                                                                         Page 25

<PAGE>

Ventas, Inc. Annual Report 2001

on the same terms (5 year amortizing 8% LIBOR cap) as the Buy Cap. If LIBOR
should exceed the 8% cap, the Sell Cap would require the Company to pay the
counterparty and the Buy Cap would require the counterparty to pay Ventas
Finance for the interest accruing in excess of the 8% LIBOR cap. The Buy Cap and
the Sell Cap are shown separately as an asset and a liability on the Company's
balance sheet, respectively. The Company believes that the economic substance of
the Buy Cap offsets the net cash flow exposure of the Sell Cap.

When interest rates rise, the interest rate swaps increase in fair value to the
Company and when interest rates fall, the interest rate swaps decline in fair
value to the Company. Similarly, when interest rates increase, the Buy Cap
increases in fair value and the Sell Cap decreases in fair value. As of December
31, 2001, interest rates had fallen and the 1998 Swap was in an unrealized loss
position, and the 2003 - 2008 Swap was in an unrealized gain position, to the
Company. Generally, interest rate swap agreements with longer terms evidence
greater dollar values of variation when interest rates change. To highlight the
sensitivity of the interest rate swaps and caps to changes in interest rates,
the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change
of 100 basis points (BPS) in interest rates as of December 31, 2001:

</TABLE>

Credit Risk
As a result of the 1998 Spin Off, the Company has a significant concentration of
credit risk with Kindred under its Master Leases. For the year ended December
31, 2001 lease rental revenues from Kindred totaled $182.9 million or 98.8% of
the Company's total rental income for the period. For the years ended December
31, 2000 and 1999, lease rental revenues from Kindred comprised $229.6 million
or 98.6% ($181.6 million or 98.4%, net of write-offs) and $225.1 million, or
approximately 98.5%, respectively, of the Company's total lease rental revenues.
Accordingly, Kindred's financial condition and ability to meet its rent
obligations will determine the Company's rental revenues and its ability to make
distributions to its stockholders. In addition, any failure by Kindred to
effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its
business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its
facilities. Kindred, as well as certain other tenants of the Company, have
experienced financial difficulty and/or filed for bankruptcy. Kindred emerged
from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001. Despite Kindred's emergence from bankruptcy,
there can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and
access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Master
Leases. Since the Company derives in excess of 98% of its rental revenues from
Kindred and since the Master Leases are triple net leases under which Kindred is
responsible for all insurance, taxes and maintenance and repair expenses
required in connection with the leased properties, the inability or
unwillingness of Kindred to satisfy its obligations under the Master Leases
would have a material adverse effect on the condition of the leased properties,
as well as a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. See "Note 4 - Concentration
of Credit Risk" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. There can be no
assurance that future healthcare legislation or changes in the administration or
implementation of governmental or other third-party healthcare reimbursement
programs will not have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company's operators and tenants which
could have a material adverse effect on their ability to make rental payments to
the Company which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The Company monitors its credit risk under its lease agreements with its tenants
by, among other things, reviewing and analyzing (a) information regarding the
healthcare industry generally, (b) publicly available information regarding
tenants, (c) information provided by the tenants under the Company's lease
agreements, and (d) discussion with tenants and their representatives.

Liquidity
The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and
available borrowings under a $25.0 million revolving line of credit under the
Credit Agreement.

Cash provided by operations totaled $79.9 million, $85.3 million and $103.6
million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Cash
flows from operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 reflects eight months
of reduced rent under the Master Leases and $4.5 million of interest payments on
the United States Settlement. Net cash provided by investing activities for the
year ended December 31, 2001 of $2.8 million included the proceeds from the
Company's sale of 83,300 shares of Kindred common stock. Net cash provided by
investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000 totaled $5.4 million
and included proceeds from the sale of two nursing facilities. Net cash provided
by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 1999 totaled $0.4
million.

Net cash used in financing activities totaled $151.5 million and included
payments of principal on the Credit Agreement in the aggregate amount of $263.0
million in 2001. $212.8 million of the payments were funded from the CMBS
Transaction which generated gross proceeds of $225 million. The 2001 financing
activities also included $6.9 million in financing costs, $41.7 million payment
on the United States Settlement, and $65.3 million of cash dividend payments.
For the year ended December 31, 2000, net cash used in financing activities was
$142.9 and included dividend payments of $42.4 million, repayments of borrowings
of $87.9 million and deferred financing costs of $12.6 million. Net cash
provided by financing activities totaled $35.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended
December 31, 1999 resulted primarily from borrowings under the Company's
revolving line of credit and from a payment received in connection with the
shortening of the Company's interest rate swap, net of dividends paid.

Capital Resources

Credit Facility
The Company, on January 31, 2000, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit,
Security, Guaranty and Pledge Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit
Agreement is comprised of the following:

 .    a $25.0 million revolving credit line (the "Revolving Credit Line") that
     expires on December 31, 2002, which bears interest at either LIBOR plus
     2.75% or the Base Rate plus 1.75%;

 .    a $200.0 million term loan due December 31, 2002 (the "Tranche A Loan"),
     which bears interest at either LIBOR plus 2.75% or the Base Rate plus
     1.75%, that was repaid in full on December 12, 2001;

 .    a $300.0 million term loan due December 31, 2005 (the "Tranche B Loan"),
     with prior amortization payments of $30.0 million on December 30, 2003 and
     $50.0 million on December 30, 2004, which bears interest at either LIBOR
     plus 3.75% or the Base Rate plus 2.75%; provided, that the principal
     amounts due on December 30, 2003 and 2004 have been prepaid, and provided
     further, the interest rate on the Tranche B Loan was reduced by .50% (50
     basis points) on December 31, 2001. The principal balance of the Tranche B
     Loan on December 31, 2001 was $150.0 million; and

 .    a $473.4 million term loan due December 31, 2007 (the "Tranche C Loan"),
     with no prior amortization required, which bears interest at either LIBOR
     plus 4.25% or the Base Rate plus 3.25%.

The loans under the Credit Agreement are pre-payable without premium or penalty.
The Base Rate is deemed to be the greater of (i) the prime rate and (ii) the
federal funds rate plus 50 basis points.

The Credit Agreement is secured by liens on substantially all of the Company's
real property (other than the 40 skilled nursing facilities securing the CMBS
Loan) and any related leases, rents and personal property. In addition, the
Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including, but not
limited to, the following: (a) the Company can only pay dividends for any year
in amounts not to exceed the greater of (i) 80% of FFO, as defined in the Credit
Agreement, or (ii) the minimum amount necessary to maintain its REIT status; (b)
limitations on additional indebtedness, acquisitions of assets, liens,
guarantees, investments, restricted payments, leases, affiliate transactions and
capital expenditures; and (c) certain financial covenants, including those
requiring the Company to have (i) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) on the last day of each fiscal quarter at least equal to 80% of the
Company's Projected Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) on
the Kindred Effective Date; and (ii) a ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to
Consolidated Interest Expense (as defined in the Credit Agreement) on a trailing
four quarter basis (or such shorter period from May 1, 2001 through the end of
the reported quarter), of at least 1.20 to 1.00. Certain of these covenants may
be waived by holders of 51% or more of the principal indebtedness under the
Credit Agreement.

The Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company's prior credit agreement
(the "Prior Credit Agreement") that it had entered into in connection with the
1998 Spin Off.

On October 29, 1999, in conjunction with the execution of a waiver of the Prior
Credit Agreement, the Company paid a $2.4 million loan waiver fee which was
amortized over the extension period ending January 31, 2000. In connection with
the consummation of the Credit Agreement on January 31, 2000, the Company paid a
$7.3 million loan restructuring fee. The fee is being amortized proportionately
over the terms of the related loans and agreements. The Company also incurred an
extraordinary loss of approximately $4.2 million relating to the write-off of
the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Prior Credit
Agreement.

The Company and substantially all of its lenders entered into an Amendment and

Ventas, Inc. Annual Report 2001

On May 21, 2001, the Company made a one-time mandatory prepayment of $0.4
million on the Tranche B Loan, based on the Company's excess cash as described
in the Credit Agreement.

The Company and substantially all of its lenders under the Credit Agreement
entered into an Amendment and Waiver No. 2 dated as of September 26, 2001
consenting to the terms of the CMBS Transaction (as defined below).

On December 12, 2001, the Company used $212.8 million of the proceeds from the
CMBS Loan (as defined below) to pay down a portion of the outstanding principal
under the Credit Agreement. See "Note 5 - Borrowing Arrangements" to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

CMBS Transaction
On December 12, 2001 the Company raised $225 million in gross
proceeds from the completion of a LIBOR based floating rate commercial mortgage
backed securitization transaction (the "CMBS Transaction"). Under a Loan and
Security Agreement dated as of December 12, 2001, Ventas Finance obtained a loan
in the principal amount of $225 million (the "CMBS Loan") from Merrill Lynch
Mortgage Lending, Inc., as lender (the "CMBS Lender"), and bearing interest at a
nominal weighted average rate of LIBOR plus 1.4589%. The CMBS Loan is comprised
of six components (i) a component in the original principal amount of $125.23
million which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.8665%; (ii) a component in the
original principal amount of $17.97 million which bears interest at LIBOR plus
1.1665%; (iii) a component in the original principal amount of $8.86 million
which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.5165%; (iv) a component in the original
principal amount of $26.83 million which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.9665%;
(v) a component in the original principal amount of $26.83 million which bears
interest at LIBOR plus 2.6665%; and (vi) a component in the original principal
amount of $19.28 million which bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.1665%. Principal
of and interest on the CMBS Loan is payable monthly, commencing January 9, 2002.
Principal payments on the CMBS Loan were calculated based upon a 25-year
amortization schedule and an assumed interest rate of 9.46% per annum. The CMBS
Loan matures on December 9, 2006 at which time a principal balloon payment of
approximately $211.0 million will be due, assuming all scheduled amortization
payments are made and no prepayments are made on the CMBS Loan. The CMBS Loan
may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time and from time to time provided
that any prepayment on or before January 9, 2003 must be accompanied by a
payment of 1% of the amount of the principal amount prepaid.

The CMBS Loan is secured by liens on forty (40) skilled nursing facilities
transferred by Ventas Realty to Ventas Finance (the "CMBS Properties") and
leased to Kindred under a Master Lease (the "CMBS Master Lease") and any related
leases, rents and personal property. Except for certain customary exceptions,
the CMBS Loan is non-recourse to Ventas Finance and the Company.

Ventas Finance is required to maintain or cause to be maintained the following
reserve accounts under the CMBS Loan Agreement: (a) a debt service reserve
account in an amount of $5.0 million to cover shortfalls in cash available for
debt service on the CMBS Loan, (b) an imposition and insurance reserve for the
payment of real property taxes and insurance premiums with respect to the CMBS
Properties, and (c) a replacement reserve account in the amount of $1.6 million
for the payment of the cost of capital improvements expected to be made to the
CMBS Properties. The impositions and insurance reserve and the replacement
reserve under the CMBS Loan Agreement are being funded and/or maintained by
Kindred as required under and in accordance with the terms of the CMBS Master
Lease. If Kindred should be unwilling or unable to fund these reserves under the
CMBS Loan Agreement, Ventas Finance will be required to fund and/or maintain
such reserves. Restricted cash at December 31, 2001 included $5.0 million
related to the debt service reserve account for the CMBS Loan.

Monthly rental amounts under the CMBS Master Lease are deposited directly by
Kindred into a central account for the benefit of the CMBS Lender. Amounts in
the central account are applied to pay the monthly principal and interest
payments on the CMBS Loan and to fund the reserve accounts required under the
CMBS Loan Agreement. Amounts remaining in the central account after the payment
of the current month's principal and interest payment and the funding of the
reserve accounts are distributed to Ventas Finance, provided no event of default
has occurred and is continuing under the CMBS Loan Agreement and provided a Cash
Flow Sweep Event (as defined below) has not occurred. The central account is
swept on a daily basis. During the continuance of an event of default or a Cash
Flow Sweep Event, all amounts in the central account in excess of the current
month's principal and interest payment and the required reserve payments will be
deposited into an account and applied as a prepayment of the CMBS Loan on the
next

monthly payment date. A "Cash Flow Sweep Event" occurs as of any date of
determination if (the "Coverage Test") (a) the ratio of (i) the aggregate net
cash flow from the CMBS Properties for the applicable quarter to (ii) the debt
service on the CMBS Loan for the same quarter, is less than 1.50 to 1, or (b)
the aggregate net cash flow from the CMBS Properties for the applicable quarter
does not equal or exceed the rent payable under the CMBS Master Lease for the
same quarter. No Cash Flow Sweep Event will occur at any time while the Coverage
Test is satisfied. See "Note 5 - Borrowing Arrangements" to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Dividends
In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company must make annual
distributions to its stockholders of at least 90% of its "REIT taxable income"
(excluding net capital gain). The Company paid dividends equal to 90% of its
estimated taxable income for 2001. The Company paid dividends equal to 95% of
its taxable income for 2000 and 1999. The Company intends to pay a dividend for
2002 equal to $0.95 per common share, but not less than 90% of the Company's
taxable income for 2002. The 2002 dividend may be paid by a combination of cash
and other property or securities, including shares of Kindred common stock.

It is expected that the Company's REIT taxable income will be less than its cash
flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non-cash deductions in
computing REIT taxable income. However, for 2001 this was partially offset by
the value of the Kindred common stock received by the Company on the Kindred
Effective Date which is included in taxable income in 2001. The Company
anticipates that it generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to
enable it to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. It is possible, however,
that the Company, from time to time, may not have sufficient cash or other
liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement or to distribute such
greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation.

Capital Expenditures and Property Acquisitions
Capital expenditures to maintain and improve the leased properties generally
will be incurred by the Company's tenants. Accordingly, the Company does not
believe that it will incur any major expenditures in connection with the leased
properties. After the terms of the leases expire, or in the event that the
tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under the leases, the
Company anticipates that any expenditures relating to the maintenance of leased
properties for which it may become responsible will be funded by cash flows from
operations or through additional borrowings. To the extent that unanticipated
expenditures or significant borrowings are required, the Company's liquidity may
be affected adversely. The Company's ability to make expenditures and borrow
funds is restricted by the terms of the Credit Agreement. Any such capital
expenditures or borrowings would likely require the consent of the "Required
Lenders" under the Credit Agreement, and there can be no assurance that such
consent would be obtained.

Other
In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a $96.5 million charge
related to the United States Settlement. Under the United States Settlement, the
Company is required to pay $103.6 million to the federal government, of which
$34.0 million was paid on the Kindred Effective Date. The balance of $69.6
million bears interest at 6% per annum and is payable in equal quarterly
installments over a five-year term commencing on June 30, 2001. The charge in
the fourth quarter of 2000 was discounted for accounting purposes based on an
imputed borrowing rate of 10.75%. The Company will be required to pay $16.2
million in principal and interest in 2002 under the United States Settlement.

The Company has outstanding loans, with interest provisions, of approximately
$3.6 million, net of repayments, to certain current and former executive
officers of the Company to finance the income taxes payable by them as a result
of the vesting of common stock of the Company awarded as compensation to such
officers and the 1998 Spin Off. The loans are payable over periods ranging from
a four to a ten year period beginning in each case on the date such loan was
made. See "Note 14 - Related Party Transactions" to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our

all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Ventas, Inc. at

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1 - Description of Business
Ventas, Inc. ("Ventas" or the "Company") is a Delaware corporation that elected
to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), for the year ended December 31,
1999. The Company believes that it has satisfied the requirements to qualify as
a REIT for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001. The Company intends to
continue to qualify as a REIT for the year ending December 31, 2002 and
subsequent years. It is possible that economic, market, legal, tax or other
considerations may cause the Company to fail, or elect not, to qualify as a
REIT. The Company owns a geographically diverse portfolio of healthcare related
facilities which consisted of 44 hospitals, 216 nursing facilities and eight
personal care facilities in 36 states as of December 31, 2001. The Company and
its subsidiaries lease these facilities to healthcare operating companies under
"triple-net" or "absolute net" leases. Kindred Healthcare, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (collectively, "Kindred") lease 210 of the Company's nursing
facilities and all of the Company's hospitals as of December 31, 2001. The
Company conducts substantially all of its business through a wholly owned
operating partnership, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership ("Ventas Realty") and
an indirect, wholly owned limited liability company, Ventas Finance I, LLC
("Ventas Finance"). The Company operates in one segment which consists of owning
and leasing healthcare facilities and leasing or subleasing such facilities to
third parties.

As a result of the Kindred bankruptcy proceedings, the Company suspended the
implementation of its original business strategy in 1999 and continued such
suspension through 2001. The Company's current business strategy is preserving
and maximizing stockholders' capital by means that include (a) the reduction of
the amount of the Company's indebtedness and a reduction of the average all-in
cost of the Company's indebtedness and (b) the implementation of a measured and
disciplined diversification and growth program to reduce the Company's
dependence on Kindred. The ability of the Company to pursue certain of these
objectives may be restricted by the terms of the Company's Amended and Restated
Credit, Security, Guaranty and Pledge Agreement dated January 31, 2000 (the
"Credit Agreement").

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Change in Accounting Principle
In June of 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( "FASB ") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( "SFAS ") No. 138, "Accounting for
Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities," which amends
SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."
SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires companies to record derivatives on the
balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. As discussed in
"Note 5 - Borrowing Arrangements," the Company uses derivative instruments to
protect against the risk of interest rate movements on future cash flows under
its variable rate debt agreements. On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS
No. 133, and at that time, designated anew the derivative instruments in
accordance with the requirements of the new standard. The adoption of the
standard as of January 1, 2001 resulted in the recognition of a liability of
$4.1 million to reflect the fair value of the Company's interest rate swap
agreement and an identical reduction to other comprehensive income, a component
of stockholders' equity. In addition, the $21.6 million deferred gain recognized
on a terminated derivative position (See "Note 5 - Borrowing Arrangements") was
reclassified to other comprehensive income, resulting in a cumulative adjustment
to other comprehensive income of $17.5 million. The FASB continues to issue
interpretive guidance that could require changes in the Company's application of
the standard. SFAS No. 133 may increase or decrease reported net income and
stockholders' equity prospectively, depending on future levels of interest
rates, the computed "effectiveness" of the derivatives, as that term is defined
by SFAS No. 133, and other variables affecting the fair values of derivative
instruments and hedged items, but will have no effect on cash flows. The Company
reported its derivative instruments at fair value on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivatives deemed to be eligible for hedge
accounting are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Changes in
fair value of derivative instruments that are not hedges are reported in the
Statement of Operations. See "Note 5 - Borrowing Arrangements." The fair value
of the Company's derivative instruments are estimated by a third party
consultant.

Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company,
Ventas Realty, Ventas Finance and all direct and indirect wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.

Real Estate Investments
Investments in real estate properties are recorded at cost. The cost of the
properties acquired is allocated between land and buildings based generally upon
independent appraisals. Depreciation for buildings is recorded on the
straight-line basis, using estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 50 years.

Impairment of Assets
Provisions for impairment losses related to long-lived assets, if any, are
recognized when expected future cash flows are less than the carrying values of
the assets. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates the
carrying value of the related real estate investments in relationship to the
future

                                                                         Page 35

Ventas, Inc. Annual Report 2001


undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. The Company adjusts the
net book value of leased properties and other long-lived assets to fair value,
if the sum of the expected future cash flow or sales proceeds is less than book
value. During the fourth quarter of 1999, a tenant at one of the Company's
facilities ceased paying rent on the facility leased by it and filed for
protection under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the
"Bankruptcy Code"). The Company deemed the asset to be impaired and recorded an
impairment loss of $1.9 million to write down the asset to its estimated fair
value as of December 31, 1999.

Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity date of
three months or less when purchased. These investments are stated at cost which
approximates fair value.

Comprehensive Income
SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," establishes guidelines for the
reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in financial
statements. Comprehensive income includes net income and all other non-owner
changes in stockholders' equity during a period including unrealized gains and
losses on equity securities classified as available-for-sale and unrealized fair
value adjustments on certain derivative instruments.

Marketable Equity Securities
Marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported
on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value.

Deferred Financing Costs
Deferred financing costs are amortized as a component of interest expense over
the terms of the related borrowings using a method that approximates a level
yield, and are net of accumulated amortization of approximately $4.6 million and
$2.2 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Revenue Recognition
Rental revenue is recognized as earned over the terms of the related leases
which are treated as operating leases. Such income includes periodic increases
based on pre-determined formulas as defined in the lease agreements. See "Note 9
- -Transactions with Kindred." Certain leases with tenants other than Kindred
contain provisions relating to increases in rental payments over the terms of
the leases. Rental income under those leases is recognized over the term of each
lease on a straight-line basis.

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company grants stock options to employees and directors with an exercise
price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of the grant. In
accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees," compensation expense is not recognized for these stock
option grants.

In addition, the Company grants shares of restricted stock to certain executive
officers and directors. Shares of restricted stock vest cumulatively in two to
four equal annual installments beginning either on the date of grant or on the
first anniversary of the date of the grant. In accordance with the provisions of
APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, compensation
expense is recognized for these restricted stock grants over the vesting period.

Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of rental revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Segment Reporting
The Company has one primary reportable segment, which consists of investment in
real estate. The Company's primary business is owning and leasing healthcare
facilities and leasing or subleasing such facilities to third parties, primarily
Kindred. See "Note 4 - Concentration of Credit Risk." All of the Company's
leases are triple-net leases, which require the tenants to pay all property
related expenses. The Company does not operate these facilities nor does it
allocate capital to maintain the properties. Substantially all depreciation and
interest expenses, except for interest expense relating to the United States
Settlement, reflected in the consolidated statement of operations relate to the
ownership of the Company's investment in real estate.

Note 3 - Revenues from Leased Properties
Under Kindred's plan of reorganization (the "Kindred Reorganization Plan"),
which became effective on April 20, 2001 (the "Kindred Effective Date"), Kindred
assumed its five pre-existing leases with the Company (the "Prior Master
Leases"). The Prior Master Leases were then amended and restated into four
agreements styled as amended and restated master leases (collectively, the
"Amended Master Leases").

In connection with the consummation on December 12, 2001 of a $225 million
commercial mortgage backed securitization transaction (the "CMBS Transaction"),
Ventas Realty removed forty (40) skilled nursing facilities (the "CMBS
Properties") from Amended Master Lease No. 1 and placed the CMBS Properties in a
new fifth master lease with Kindred dated December 12, 2001 (the "CMBS Master
Lease"). Simultaneously with the closing of the CMBS Transaction, Ventas Realty
transferred the CMBS Properties and the CMBS Master Lease to Ventas Finance, the
borrower under the CMBS Transaction. The Amended Master Leases and the CMBS
Master Lease are collectively referred to as the "Master Leases."

Each Master Lease is a "triple-net lease" or an "absolute-net lease" pursuant to
which Kindred is required to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance
and repairs related to the properties. There are several renewal bundles of
properties under each Master Lease, with each bundle containing a varying number
of properties. All properties within a bundle have primary terms ranging from 10
to 15 years commencing May 1, 1998, plus renewal options totaling fifteen years.

Under each Master Lease, the aggregate annual rent is referred to as Base Rent
(as defined in each Master Lease). Base Rent equals the sum of Current Rent (as
defined in each Master Lease) and Accrued Rent (as defined in each Master
Lease). Kindred is obligated to pay the portion of Base Rent that is Current
Rent, and unpaid Accrued Rents, as set forth below. From May 1, 2001 through
April 30, 2004, Base Rent will equal Current Rent. Under the Master Leases, the
initial annual aggregate Base Rent is $180.7 million from May 1, 2001 to April
30, 2002. For the period from May 1, 2002 through April 30, 2004, annual
aggregate Base Rent, payable all in cash, escalates on May 1 of each year at an
annual rate of 3.5% over the Prior Period Base Rent (as defined in the Master
Leases) if certain Kindred revenue parameters are met. Assuming such Kindred
revenue parameters are met, Annual Base Rent under the Master Leases would be
$187.0 million from May 1, 2002 to April 30, 2003 and $193.6 million from May 1,
2003 to April 30, 2004.

Each Master Lease provides that beginning May 1, 2004, if Kindred refinances its
senior secured indebtedness entered into in connection with the Kindred
Reorganization Plan or takes other similar action (a "Kindred Refinancing"), the
3.5% annual escalator will be paid in cash and the Base Rent shall continue to
equal Current Rent. If a Kindred Refinancing has not occurred, then on May 1,
2004, the annual aggregate Base Rent will be comprised of (a) Current Rent
payable in cash which will escalate annually by an amount equal to 2% of Prior
Period Base Rent, and (b) an additional annual non-cash accrued escalator amount
of 1.5% of the Prior Period Base Rent which will accrete from year to year
including an interest accrual at LIBOR (as defined in the Master Leases) plus
450 basis points (compounded annually) to be added to the annual accreted amount
(but such interest will not be added to the aggregate Base Rent in subsequent
years). The Unpaid Accrued Rent will become payable, and all future Base Rent
escalators will be payable in cash, upon the occurrence of a Kindred
Refinancing. Under certain circumstances, the Company's right to receive payment
of the Unpaid Accrued Rent is subordinate to the receipt of payment by the
lenders of Kindred's senior secured indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of a
Kindred Refinancing, the annual aggregate Base Rent payable in cash will
thereafter escalate at the annual rate of 3.5% and there will be no further
accrual feature for rents arising after the occurrence of such events.

For the period from January 1, 2001 through April 30, 2001, the Company recorded
revenue equal to the amount of rent actually paid by Kindred under a stipulation
entered into in connection with Kindred's bankruptcy proceedings (the "Rent
Stipulation"). The Company included in its revenue computation for the period
from May 1, 2001 through December 31, 2001 the amount due and payable under the
Master Leases for that period.

The future contracted minimum rentals, excluding rent escalations and the
amortization of the value of the Kindred common stock and the $4.5 million in
cash received on the Kindred Effective Date, but with normalized rents where
applicable, for the remainder of the initial terms of the Master Leases and the
Company's leases with tenants other than Kindred are as follows (see "Note 9 -
Transactions with Kindred"):

(1) Excludes tenants that have defaulted under the terms of their
    respective leases or that have filed for protection under the
    Bankruptcy Code.

Note 4 - Concentration of Credit Risk
As of December 31, 2001, 70.4% of the Company's real estate investments related
to skilled nursing facilities. The remaining real estate investments consist of
hospitals and personal care facilities. The Company's facilities are located in
36 states with rental revenues from operations in only one state accounting for
more than ten percent (10%). Approximately 98.0% of the Company's real estate
investments, based on the original cost of such investments, are operated by
Kindred and approximately 98.8% of rental revenue in 2001 was derived from the
Master Leases or the Prior Master Leases.

Because the Company leases substantially all of its properties to Kindred and
Kindred is the primary source of the Company's rental revenues, Kindred's
financial condition and ability and willingness to satisfy its rent obligations
under the Master Leases and certain other agreements will significantly impact
the Company's rental revenues and its ability to service its indebtedness and
its obligations under the United States Settlement (as defined in "Note 9 -
Transactions with Kindred - Settlement of United States Claims") and to make
distributions to its stockholders. On September 13, 1999, Kindred filed for
protection under the Bankruptcy Code with the United States Bankruptcy Court for
the District of Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court"). The Kindred Reorganization
Plan became effective and Kindred emerged from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001.
Despite Kindred's emergence from bankruptcy, there can be no assurance that
Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it
to satisfy its obligations under the Master Leases or that Kindred will perform
its obligations under the Master Leases. The inability or unwillingness of
Kindred to satisfy its obligations under the Master Leases would have a material

                                                                         Page 37

adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operation and
liquidity of the Company, on the Company's ability to service its indebtedness
and its obligations under the United States Settlement and on the Company's
ability to make distributions to its stockholders as required to maintain its
status as a REIT (a "Material Adverse Effect"). The failure of Kindred to make
three consecutive rent payments will trigger an event of default under the
Company's Credit Agreement (as defined below).

The Company generally invests excess cash in short term maturities of time
deposits and other similar cash equivalents as required by the Credit Agreement
(as defined below). See "Note 5 - Borrowing Arrangements."

</TABLE>

The Credit Agreement
On January 31, 2000, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement. The loans
under the Credit Agreement are pre-payable without premium or penalty.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a margin over LIBOR
described above or at a margin (that is 100 basis points less than the LIBOR
margin) over a Base Rate. The Base Rate is deemed to be the greater of (i) the
prime rate and (ii) the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points.

The Credit Agreement is secured by liens on substantially all of the Company's
real property (other than the 40 skilled nursing facilities securing the CMBS
Loan) and any related leases, rents and personal property. In addition, the
Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including, but not
limited to, the following: (a) the Company can only pay dividends for any year
in amounts not to exceed the greater of (i) 80% of FFO, as defined in the Credit
Agreement, or (ii) the minimum amount necessary to maintain its REIT status; (b)
limitations on additional indebtedness, acquisitions of assets, liens,
guarantees, investments, restricted payments, leases, affiliate transactions and
capital expenditures; and (c) certain financial covenants, including those
requiring the Company to have (i) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) on the last day of each fiscal quarter at least equal to 80% of the
Company's Projected Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) on
the Kindred Effective Date; and (ii) a ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to
Consolidated Interest Expense (as defined in the Credit Agreement) on a trailing
four quarter basis (or such shorter period from May 1, 2001 through the end of
the reported quarter), of at least 1.20 to 1.00. Certain of these covenants may
be waived by holders of 51% or more of the principal indebtedness under the
Credit Agreement.

The Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company's prior credit agreement
(the "Prior Credit Agreement") that it had entered into at the time of the
Company's spin-off of Kindred on May 1, 1998 (the "1998 Spin Off").

On October 29, 1999, in conjunction with the execution of a waiver of the Prior
Credit Agreement, the Company paid a $2.4 million loan waiver fee which was
amortized over the extension period ending January 31, 2000. In connection with
the consummation of the Credit Agreement on January 31, 2000, the Company paid a
$7.3 million loan restructuring fee. The fee is being amortized proportionately
over the terms of the related loans and agreements. The Company also incurred an
extraordinary loss of approximately $4.2 million relating to the write-off of
the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Prior Credit
Agreement.

The Company and substantially all of its lenders entered into an Amendment and
Waiver dated as of December 20, 2000 (the "Amendment and Waiver No. 1") to the
Credit Agreement, that extended the deadline for the Kindred Effective Date from
December 31, 2000 to March 31, 2001. In consideration for this extension, the
Company paid a fee of $0.2 million to the lenders executing the Amendment and
Waiver No. 1 and agreed to amend the amortization schedules on certain of the
loans under the Credit Agreement. The Company exercised its extension option
under the Amendment and Waiver No. 1 to extend the Kindred Effective Date
deadline from March 31, 2001 to April 30, 2001 for a fee of approximately $0.1
million.

On May 21, 2001, the Company made a one-time mandatory prepayment of $0.4
million on the Tranche B Loan, based on its excess cash as described in the
Credit Agreement.

The Company and substantially all of its lenders under the Credit Agreement
entered into an Amendment and Waiver No. 2 dated as of September 26, 2001
consenting to the terms of the CMBS Transaction.

On December 12, 2001, the Company used $212.8 million of the proceeds from the
CMBS Loan (as defined below) to pay down a portion of the outstanding principal
under the Credit Agreement. As a result of the prepayment, the Company's
obligation to make monthly mandatory prepayments from excess cash flow and the
restriction limiting dividends to 90% of taxable net income both terminated. The
Company recognized a $1.3 million extraordinary loss in the fourth quarter of
2001 relating to the partial write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs
as a result of such prepayment.

CMBS Transaction
On December 12, 2001 the Company raised $225 million in gross proceeds from the
completion of the CMBS Transaction. Under a Loan and Security Agreement dated as
of December 12, 2001, Ventas Finance I, LLC, an indirect, wholly owned
consolidated subsidiary of the Company ("Ventas Finance") obtained a loan in the
principal amount of $225 million (the "CMBS Loan") from Merrill Lynch Mortgage
Lending, Inc., as lender (the "CMBS Lender"). The CMBS Loan is comprised of six
components (i) a component in the original principal amount of $125.23 million
which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.8665%; (ii) a component in the original
principal amount of $17.97 million which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.1665%;
(iii) a component in the original principal amount of $8.86 million which bears
interest at LIBOR plus 1.5165%; (iv) a component in the original principal
amount of $26.83 million which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.9665%; (v) a
component in the original principal amount of $26.83 million which bears
interest at LIBOR plus 2.6665%; and (vi) a component in the original principal
amount of $19.28 million which bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.1665%. Principal
of and interest on the CMBS Loan is payable monthly, commencing January 9, 2002.
Principal payments on the CMBS Loan were calculated based upon a 25-year
amortization schedule and an assumed interest rate of 9.46% per annum. The CMBS
Loan matures on December 9, 2006 at which time a principal balloon payment of
approximately $211.0 million will be due, assuming all scheduled amortization
payments are made and no prepayments are made on the CMBS Loan. The CMBS Loan
may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time and from time to time provided
that any prepayment on or before January 9, 2003 must be accompanied by a
payment of 1% of the amount of the principal amount prepaid.

The CMBS Loan is secured by liens on the CMBS Properties transferred by Ventas
Realty to Ventas Finance and leased to Kindred under the CMBS Master Lease.
Except for certain customary exceptions, the CMBS Loan is non-recourse to Ventas
Finance and the Company.

Ventas Finance is required to maintain or cause to be maintained the following
reserve accounts under the CMBS Loan Agreement: (a) a debt service reserve
account in an amount of $5.0 million to cover shortfalls in cash available for
debt service on the CMBS Loan, (b) an imposition and insurance reserve for the
payment of real property taxes and insurance premiums with respect to the CMBS
Properties, and (c) a replacement reserve account in the amount of $1.6 million
for the payment of the cost of capital improvements expected to be made to the
CMBS Properties. The impositions and insurance reserve and the replacement
reserve under the CMBS Loan Agreement are being funded and/or maintained by
Kindred as required under and in accordance with the terms of the CMBS Master
Lease. If Kindred should be unwilling or unable to fund these reserves under the
CMBS Loan Agreement, Ventas Finance will be required to fund and/or maintain
such reserves. Restricted cash at December 31, 2001 included $5.0 million
related to the debt service reserve account for the CMBS Loan.

Monthly rental amounts under the CMBS Master Lease are deposited directly by
Kindred into a central account for the benefit of the CMBS Lender. Amounts in
the central account are applied to pay the monthly principal and interest
payments on the CMBS Loan and to fund the reserve accounts required under the
CMBS Loan Agreement. Amounts remaining in the central account after the payment
of the current month's principal and interest payment and the funding of the
reserve accounts are distributed to Ventas Finance, provided no event of default
has occurred and is continuing under the CMBS Loan Agreement and provided a Cash
Flow Sweep Event (as defined below) has not occurred. The central account is
swept on a daily basis.

                                                                         Page 39

<PAGE>
Ventas, Inc. Annual Report 2001


During the continuance of an event of default or a Cash Flow Sweep Event, all
amounts in the central account in excess of the current month's principal and
interest payment and the required reserve payments will be deposited into an
account and applied as a prepayment of the CMBS Loan on the next monthly payment
date. A "Cash Flow Sweep Event" occurs as of any date of determination if (the
"Coverage Test") (a) the ratio of (i) the aggregate net cash flow from the CMBS
Properties for the applicable quarter to (ii) the debt service on the CMBS Loan
for the same quarter, is less than 1.50 to 1, or (b) the aggregate net cash flow
from the CMBS Properties for the applicable quarter does not equal or exceed the
rent payable under the CMBS Master Lease for the same quarter. No Cash Flow
Sweep Event will occur at any time while the Coverage Test is satisfied.

Derivatives and Hedging
In connection with the 1998 Spin Off and the consummation of the Prior Credit
Agreement, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (on a
notional amount of $800.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2001) to reduce
the impact of changes in interest rates on the Company's floating rate debt
obligations (the "1998 Swap"). The original agreement expired in varying amounts
through December 2007; however, as discussed below, the 1998 Swap was amended to
expire in varying amounts through June 2003. The 1998 Swap provides for the
Company to pay a fixed rate of 5.985% and receive LIBOR (floating rate) from the
counterparty.

The terms of the 1998 Swap require that the Company make a cash deposit or
otherwise post collateral to the counterparty if the fair value loss to the
Company exceeds certain levels (the "threshold levels"). The threshold levels
vary based on the relationship between the Company's debt obligations and the
tangible fair value of its assets as defined in the Prior Credit Agreement. As
of December 31, 2001, the Company believes that the threshold level under the
1998 Swap was a fair value unrealized loss of $35.0 million and the 1998 Swap
was in an unrealized loss position to the Company of $36.4 million.

As of December 31, 2001, the Company was required to have collateral posted
under the 1998 Swap of $1.4 million. The $7.7 million letter of credit posted as
collateral under the 1998 Swap on December 31, 2001 was reduced to $1.4 million
on January 2, 2002. Generally, once the fair value loss exceeds the applicable
threshold level, collateral is either posted by the Company or returned to the
Company if the value of the 1998 Swap fluctuates by $2.0 million from the value
on the last date that a counterparty demands collateral be posted or refunded,
as applicable. Under the 1998 Swap, if collateral must be posted, the principal
amount of such collateral must equal the difference between the fair value
unrealized loss of the 1998 Swap at the time of such determination and the
threshold level. If the 1998 Swap continues to decline in value, the Company
will have to post additional collateral in the form of cash, letter of credit or
other permitted credit support. The Company is permitted to issue up to $15.0
million in principal amount of letters of credit under the $25.0 million
revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement. If the Company should be
required to post collateral under the 1998 Swap, the Company expects to post
such additional collateral in the form of cash from cash reserves, cash flows
from operations, and/or draws on the Company's revolving credit facility under
the Credit Agreement up to the principal amount of $15.0 million, net of
outstanding letters of credit. However, there can be no assurance that the
Company will have sufficient cash to post such additional collateral, if
required. On January 31, 2000, the Company entered into a letter agreement with
the counterparty to the 1998 Swap for the purpose of amending the 1998 Swap. The
letter agreement provides that, for purposes of certain calculations set forth
in the 1998 Swap, the parties agree to continue to use certain defined terms set
forth in the Prior Credit Agreement.

On August 4, 1999, the Company entered into an agreement with the 1998 Swap
counterparty to shorten the maturity of the 1998 Swap from December 31, 2007 to
June 30, 2003, in exchange for a payment in 1999 from the counterparty to the
Company of $21.6 million. The Company expects to amortize the $21.6 million
payment for financial accounting purposes in future periods beginning in July
2003 and ending December 2007. See "Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies - Change in Accounting Principles."

On January 31, 2000, the Company entered into a letter agreement with the
counterparty to the 1998 Swap for the purpose of amending the 1998 Swap. The
letter agreement provides that, for purposes of certain calculations set forth
in the 1998 Swap, the parties agree to continue to use certain defined terms set
forth in the Prior Credit Agreement.

The notional amount of the 1998 Swap is scheduled to decline from $800.0 million
as of December 31, 2001 as follows (in thousands):

Notional Amount                                                             Date

$775,000                                                       December 31, 2002
 --                                                                June 30, 2003

The 1998 Swap is treated as a cash flow hedge. Cash flow hedges address the risk
associated with future cash flows of debt transactions. Over time, the
unrealized gains and losses held in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income will
be reclassified into earnings in the same periods in which the hedged interest
payments affect earnings. Assuming no changes in interest rates, the Company
estimates that approximately $24.3 million of the current balance held in
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income will be recorded as interest expense
within the next twelve months consistent with historical reporting. The amount
reclassified into interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was
$13.7 million. See "Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Change
in Accounting Principle."

On September 28, 2001, the Company entered into a second interest rate swap
agreement (the "2003 - 2008 Swap") with a highly rated counterparty to hedge
floating-rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008, under
which the Company pays a fixed rate of 5.385% and receives LIBOR from the
counterparty to this agreement. The 2003 - 2008 Swap is treated as a cash flow
hedge for accounting purposes. There are no collateral requirements under the
2003 - 2008 Swap. The notional amount of the 2003 - 2008 Swap is scheduled to
decline from $450.0 million as of December 31, 2001 as follows (in thousands):

Notional Amount                                                             Date

$300,000                                                           June 30, 2006
 150,000                                                           June 30, 2007
 --                                                                June 30, 2008

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
counterparty to an interest rate swap agreement. However, the Company does not
anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties to the 1998 Swap or the
2003-2008 Swap. The net interest rate difference incurred on these swap
contracts for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $13.8 million
payment, $4.3 million receipt and $6.4 million payment, respectively, included
in interest expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In accordance with the terms of the CMBS Loan Agreement, on December 11, 2001,
Ventas Finance purchased an interest rate cap from a highly rated counterparty
(the "Buy Cap"). Because the Company already hedged its consolidated interest
rate risk through the 1998 Swap and 2003 - 2008 Swap, on December 11, 2001 the
Company sold an interest rate cap (the "Sell Cap") for the same notional value
($225 million) and on the same terms (5 year amortizing 8% LIBOR cap) as the Buy
Cap. If LIBOR should exceed the 8% cap, the Sell Cap would require the Company
to pay the counterparty and the Buy Cap would require the counterparty to pay
Ventas Finance for the interest accruing in excess of the 8% LIBOR cap. The Buy
Cap and the Sell Cap are shown separately as an asset and a liability on the
Company's balance sheet, respectively. The Company believes that the economic
substance of the Buy Cap offsets the net cash flow exposure of the Sell Cap.

At December 31, 2001, the 1998 Swap and 2003 - 2008 Swap were reported at their
fair value of $27.4 million in liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The offsetting adjustment is reported as a deferred loss in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income. The Buy and Sell Caps are reported at their fair value of
approximately $3.1 million in other assets and other liabilities, respectively,
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The offsetting adjustments for each of these
instruments are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and net to
zero for the year.

Note 6 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments
The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its
fair value disclosures for financial instruments.

     .    Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount of cash and cash
          equivalents reported in the balance sheet approximates fair value
          because of the short maturity of these instruments.

     .    Investment in Kindred common stock. The fair value is based on the
          quoted market value on December 31, 2001.

     .    Notes receivable from employees: The fair values of the notes
          receivable from employees are estimated using a discounted cash flow
          analysis, using interest rates being offered for similar loans to
          borrowers with similar credit ratings.

     .    Interest rate swap and cap agreements: The fair values of the
          Company's interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements are
          based on rates being offered for similar arrangements.

     .    Notes payable: The fair values of the Company's borrowings under
          variable rate agreements approximate their carrying value.

     .    United States Settlement: The fair value of the Company's settlement
          with the United States approximates its carrying value.

                                                                         Page 41

Fair value estimates are subjective in nature and are dependent on a number of
important assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows, risks, discount
rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial
instrument. The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies
may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts.
Accordingly, the estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of the
amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange.

Note 7 - Stockholders' Equity and Stock Options
The Company has five plans under which options to purchase Common Stock have
been, or may be, granted to officers, employees and non-employee directors and
one plan under which certain directors may receive Common Stock of the Company
in lieu of directors' fees (the following are collectively referred to as the
"Plans"): (1) The 1987 Incentive Compensation Program (Employee Plan); (2) The
2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan); (3) The 1987 Stock Option Plan
for Non-Employee Directors; (4) The 2000 Stock Option Plan for Directors; (5)
The TheraTx, Incorporated 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan; and (6) The
Common Stock Purchase Plan for Directors (the "Directors Stock Purchase Plan").
On May 23, 2000, the Company's stockholders voted in favor of the amendment and
restatement of the 1997 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors as the 2000
Stock Option Plan for Directors and the amendment and restatement of the 1997
Incentive Compensation Plan as the 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2000
Incentive Plan"). As part of the amendment and restatement of the 2000 Incentive
Plan, the Company's Board of Directors increased the number of shares reserved
for issuance under the 2000 Incentive Plan by 2.22 million shares and increased
the maximum number of shares with respect to which stock options can be granted
during a calendar year to any given individual to 750,000 shares.

Under the Plans (other than the Directors Stock Purchase Plan), options are
exercisable at the market price at the date of grant, expire ten years from the
date of grant, and vest over varying periods ranging from one to four years. The
Company has also granted options and restricted stock to certain officers,
employees and non-employee directors outside of the Plans. The options and
shares of restricted stock that have been granted outside the Plans vest over
varying periods and the options are exercisable at the market price at the date
of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2001,
options for 4,282,858 shares had been granted to eligible participants and
remained outstanding (including options granted prior to the 1998 Spin Off and
held by Kindred employees) under the provisions of the Plans. As of December 31,
2001, options for 551,361 shares had been granted outside of the Plans to
certain employees and non-employee directors and remained outstanding. The
Company granted 308,250, 466,705 and 188,500 shares of restricted stock for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The market value of
the restricted shares on the date of the award has been recorded as unearned
compensation on restricted stock, with the unamortized balance shown as a
separate component of stockholders' equity. Unearned compensation is amortized
to expense over the vesting period, with charges to operations of approximately
$1.7 million in 2001 and $1.3 million for both 2000 and 1999, respectively.

The Company utilizes only the 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan),
the 2000 Stock Option Plan for Directors and the Directors Stock Purchase Plan
for option and stock grants and stock issuances. Under the terms of the Ventas,
Inc. 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee Plan), 5,620,000 shares are
reserved for grants to employees. Under the terms of the Ventas, Inc. 2000 Stock
Option Plan for Directors, 200,000 shares are reserved for grants or issuance to
the chairman of the board and non-employee directors. Under the terms of the
Directors Stock Purchase Plan, 200,000 shares are reserved for

issuance to the chairman of the board and non-employee directors in lieu of the
payment of all or a portion of their retainer and meeting fees, at their option.
As of December 31, 2001, the number of shares available for future grants or
issuance under the Ventas, Inc. 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan (Employee
Plan), the Ventas, Inc. 2000 Stock Option Plan for Directors, and the Directors
Stock Purchase Plan are 2,406,688, 110,250 and 195,168, respectively. No
additional grants are permitted under the 1987 Incentive Compensation Program,
the 1987 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the TheraTx,
Incorporated 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan. As a result the number of
shares reserved under these three Plans equals the number of options outstanding
under such Plans. As of December 31, 2001, the Company has reserved 2,498,386
shares for issuance under these three Plans.

Ventas, Inc. Annual Report 2001

In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"
(Statement 123). This standard prescribes a fair value based method of
accounting for employee stock options or similar equity instruments and requires
certain pro forma disclosures. For purposes of the pro forma disclosures
required under Statement 123, the estimated fair value of the options is
amortized to expense over the option's vesting period. The estimated fair value
of options granted for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was
approximately $633,300, $135,800 and $1,232,000, respectively.

Pro forma information follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

                                           2001           2000           1999

In determining the estimated fair value of the Company's stock options as of the
date of grant, a Black-Scholes option pricing model was used with the following
assumptions:

                                           2001           2000           1999

Weighted average
   expected life of options             9 years        8 years        8 years

The Black-Scholes options valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of
highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.
Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

Note 8 - Income Taxes
The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 as amended (the "Code"), commencing with the year that ended December 31,
1999. The Company intends to continue to operate in such a manner as to enable
it to qualify as a REIT. The Company's actual qualification and taxation as a
REIT depends upon its ability to meet, on a continuing basis, distribution
levels, stock ownership, and the various qualification tests imposed under the
Code.

No net provision for income taxes has been recorded in the Consolidated
Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 due to the
Company's belief that it qualified as a REIT, the distribution of 95% of its
2000 and 1999 taxable income as a dividend and the existence of carryforward
operating losses that offset the remaining 2000 and 1999 liability for federal
corporate income taxes. As a result of the uncertainties relating to the
Company's ability to retain its operating loss carryforwards, the Company has
recorded a provision for taxes on the 10% of its estimated 2001 taxable income
which the Company did not distribute as a dividend. The 5.0% effective tax rate
for 2001 was determined based on the 35% federal statutory rate plus an
incremental state rate less the dividends paid deduction.

The 2001 provision for income taxes consists of the following:

Current tax expense:
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Federal                                                                   $2,310
State                                                                        375
                                                                          ------
                                                                          $2,685
                                                                          ======

Although the Company believes that it satisfied the requirements to qualify as a
REIT for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 and although the
Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT for the year ended December 31,
2002 and subsequent years, it is possible that economic, market, legal, tax or
other considerations may cause the Company to fail, or elect not, to continue to
qualify as a REIT in any such tax year.

The Company believes it has met the annual distribution requirement by payment
of 90% of its estimated 2001 taxable income as a result of its three $0.22 per
share dividends paid on May 14, 2001, July 23, 2001, and October 1, 2001 and its
$0.26 per share dividend paid on January 7, 2002. The Company believes that it
met the annual distribution requirement for 2000 as a result of its $0.29 per
share dividend on January 15, 2001 and the annual distribution requirement for
1999 as a result of its $0.39 per share dividend paid in February 1999 and its
$0.62 per share dividend paid in September 2000. During 1999, the Company was
subject to a federal excise tax under REIT regulations of the Code to the extent
that required distributions to qualify as a REIT for 1999 were not paid by
January 31, 2000

and recorded such expense and liability of $1.5 million in the Consolidated
Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 1999. The Company's
dividends for the tax years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 constitute
ordinary income to the Company's stockholders for tax purposes.

Net taxable income for federal income tax purposes results from net income for
financial reporting purposes adjusted for the differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, including depreciation,
prepaid rent, impairment losses on real estate, the United States Settlement
liability, and the deferred gain on the partial termination of the interest rate
swap agreement. The net difference between tax bases of the Company's asset and
liabilities for federal income tax purposes was $51.4 and $48.3 million more
than the book bases of those assets and liabilities for financial reporting for
the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The Company made no income tax payments for the years ended December 31, 2000
and 1999. The Company utilized net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards of $1.0
million and $3.0 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, to offset taxes due on
the 5% of undistributed net taxable income of the Company for these years.

The Company received refunds for state and local, franchise and other
miscellaneous taxes of $1.9 and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company has recorded a tax contingency
liability of $7.1 million at December 31, 2001 and $3.7 million at December 31,
2000 for contingencies arising from and prior to the Spin Off. Included in
general administrative expenses on the Company's statement of operations is a
tax contingency expense of $1.5 million and $2.6 million for 2001 and 2000,
respectively, for federal, state, local, franchise and other miscellaneous
taxes, net of the Company's receipt of refunds referred to above.

As a former C corporation for federal income tax purposes, the Company
potentially remains subject to corporate level taxes for any asset dispositions
for the period January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2008 ("built-in gains tax").
The amount of income potentially subject to this special corporate level tax is
generally equal to (a) the excess of the fair value of the asset as of December
31, 1998 over its adjusted tax basis as of December 31, 1998, or (b) the actual
amount of gain, whichever of (a) and (b) is lower. Some but not all gains
recognized during this period of time could be offset by available net operating
losses and capital loss carryforwards. The deferred income tax liability of
$30.4 million and $30.5 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively,
reflects a previously established liability to be utilized for any built-in gain
tax incurred on assets that are disposed of prior to January 1, 2009. During
2001, the Company utilized $0.1 million of the deferred income tax liability in
connection with a sales transaction.

On February 3, 2000 the Company received a refund (the "Refund") of
approximately $26.6 million from the Internal Revenue Service representing $25.3
million from the refund of income taxes paid by it from 1996 and 1997 and $1.3
million from accrued interest thereon as a result of carrybacks of losses
reported in the Company's 1998 federal income tax return. The Company, Ventas
Realty and Kindred entered into a stipulation relating to certain of these
federal, state and tax refunds (including the Refund) on or about May 23, 2000
(the "Tax Stipulation"). On the Kindred Effective Date, Kindred and the Company
entered into the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement and First Amendment of the Tax
Allocation Agreement (the "Tax Refund Escrow Agreement") governing their
relative entitlement to certain tax refunds for the tax periods prior to and
including May 1, 1998 (the "Subject Periods") that each received or may receive
in the future. The Tax Refund Escrow Agreement amends and supplements the Tax
Allocation Agreement and supersedes the Tax Stipulation. See "Note 9 -
Transactions with Kindred - The Tax Refund Escrow Agreement and Tax Allocation
Agreement."

On October 18, 2000 the Internal Revenue Service completed its review of the
Company's federal income tax returns for the tax years ending December 31, 1995
and 1996. During 2001, the Company received a $3.2 million refund as a result of
the audit adjustments to the Company's 1995 and 1996 federal income tax returns.
These proceeds were deposited into the tax escrow account.

The Internal Revenue Service is currently reviewing the federal income tax
returns of the Company for tax years ending December 31, 1997 and 1998. There
can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of these matters or whether such
outcome will have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. However, the
resulting tax liabilities, if any, for the tax years ended December 31, 1997 and
1998 will be satisfied first from the use of NOL carryforwards (including the
NOL carryforwards that were utilized to offset the Company's federal income tax
liability for 1999 and 2000), and if the tax liabilities exceed the amount of
NOL carryforwards, then from the escrowed amounts under the Tax Refund Escrow
Agreement. To the extent such NOL carryforwards and escrowed amounts are not
sufficient to satisfy such liabilities, Kindred has indemnified the Company for
certain but not all of these tax liabilities under the Tax Allocation Agreement.
There can be no assurance that the NOL carryforwards and the escrowed amounts
will be sufficient to satisfy these liabilities or that Kindred has any
obligation to indemnify the Company for particular liabilities or that Kindred
will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to
satisfy its indemnity obligations under the Tax Allocation Agreement or that
Kindred will continue to honor such indemnification obligations.

                                                                         Page 45

<PAGE>
Ventas, Inc. Annual Report 2001


The Company's 1998 federal income tax return reflected capital loss
carryforwards of approximately $200.1 million of which $0.6 million was carried
back to 1996 and $52.0 million was provided for tax contingencies, the remaining
$147.5 million can only be utilized against future capital gains, if any. After
fully utilizing NOL carrybacks, the Company also has an NOL carryforward of
$13.0 million at December 31, 2001 assuming no utilization in 2001. These
amounts can be used to offset future taxable income (and/or taxable income for
prior years if audits of any prior year's return determine that amounts are
owed), if any, remaining after the dividends paid deduction. The Company's
ability to utilize tax carryforwards will be subject to a variety of factors,
including the Company's dividend distribution policy and the results of its
audit. In general, the Company will be entitled to utilize NOLs and tax credit
carryforwards only to the extent that REIT taxable income exceeds the Company's
deduction for dividends paid. The NOL carryforwards expire in 2018 and the
capital loss carryforwards expire in 2003.

As a result of the uncertainties relating to the ultimate utilization of
favorable tax attributes described above, no net deferred tax benefit has been
ascribed to capital loss and net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31,
2001 and 2000. The IRS may challenge the Company's entitlement to these tax
attributes during its current review of the Company's tax returns for the 1997
and 1998 tax years. The Company believes it is entitled to these tax attributes,
but there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters.

Note 9 - Transactions with Kindred
On September 13, 1999 (the "Petition Date"), Kindred filed for protection under
the Bankruptcy Code. Kindred emerged from proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code
on the Kindred Effective Date pursuant to the terms of the Kindred
Reorganization Plan.

In order to govern certain of the relationships between the Company and Kindred
after the 1998 Spin Off and to provide mechanisms for an orderly transition, the
Company and Kindred entered into certain agreements at the time of the 1998 Spin
Off (the "Spin Agreements"). Except as noted below, each written agreement by
and among Kindred and the Company and/or Ventas Realty was assumed by Kindred
and certain of these agreements were simultaneously amended in accordance with
the terms of the Kindred Reorganization Plan.

The Company and Kindred also entered into certain agreements and stipulations
and orders both prior to and during the pendency of Kindred's bankruptcy
proceedings governing certain aspects of the business relationships between the
Company and Kindred prior to the Kindred Effective Date. These agreements and
stipulations and orders were terminated on the Kindred Effective Date in
accordance with the terms of the Kindred Reorganization Plan.

Set forth below is a description of the material terms of (a) the Kindred
Reorganization Plan, (b) certain of the Spin Agreements as assumed by Kindred
pursuant to the Kindred Reorganization Plan, including the terms of amendments
or restatements of such Spin Agreements, where applicable, (c) those Spin
Agreements and other agreements terminated under the Kindred Reorganization
Plan, and (d) new agreements entered into between the Company and Kindred in
accordance with the Kindred Reorganization Plan.

Summary of the Kindred Reorganization Plan
Under the terms of the Kindred Reorganization Plan, the Company, among other
things, (a) retained all rent paid by Kindred through the Kindred Effective
Date, (b) amended and restated its leases with Kindred, (c) received 1,498,500
shares of the common stock of Kindred together with certain registration rights,
(d) entered into new agreements relating to the allocation of certain tax
refunds and liabilities, and (e) settled certain claims of the United States
pertaining to the Company's former healthcare operations.

Master Leases
Under the Kindred Reorganization Plan, Kindred assumed the Prior Master Leases.
Those leases were then amended and restated into four agreements styled as
amended and restated master leases. In connection with the CMBS Transaction,
Ventas Realty removed the CMBS Properties from Master Lease No. 1 and entered
into the CMBS Master Lease to cover the CMBS Properties. The CMBS Master Lease
contains the same terms as Master Lease No. 1.

On the Kindred Effective Date, the Company also received a $4.5 million cash
payment as additional future rent under the Master Leases. The value of the
Company's Kindred common stock and the $4.5 million additional future rent will
be amortized as future rent over the weighted average remaining term of the
Master Leases for financial reporting purposes.

Under the Kindred Reorganization Plan, the Company waived the right to the
payment of (a) $18.9 million for the August 1999 unpaid monthly base rent under
the Prior Master Leases and (b) approximately $79.5 million representing the
difference between the rent required to be paid under the terms of the Prior
Master Leases and the rent paid to the Company after the Petition Date and prior
to the first calendar month following the Kindred Effective Date pursuant to the
terms of a rent stipulation.

Each Master Lease includes land, buildings, structures and other improvements on
the land, easements and similar appurtenances to the land and improvements, and
permanently affixed equipment, machinery and other fixtures relating to the
operation of the properties covered by the Master Leases. There are several
renewal bundles of properties under each Master Lease, with each bundle
containing a varying number of properties. All properties within a bundle have
primary terms ranging from 10 to 15 years from May 1, 1998, subject to certain
exceptions, and are subject to three five-year renewal terms.

For a discussion of the rent payable under the Master Leases see "Note 3 -
Revenues from Leased Properties."

Under the terms of the Master Leases, the Company has a one-time right to reset
the rents under the Master Leases (the "Reset Right"), exercisable 5 years after
the Kindred Effective Date on a Master Lease by Master Lease basis, to a then
fair market rental rate, for a total fee of $5.0 million payable on a pro-rata
basis at the time of exercise under the applicable Master Lease. The Reset Right
under the CMBS Master Lease can only be exercised in conjunction with the
exercise of the Reset Right under Master Lease No. 1. The Company cannot
exercise the Reset Right under the CMBS Master Lease without the prior written
consent of the CMBS Lender if, as a result of such reset, the aggregate rent
payable for the CMBS Properties would decrease.

As a result of delays in the extended Kindred bankruptcy proceeding, the
ultimate outcome of the Kindred Reorganization Plan and the determination that
such an amount is uncollectible, the Company wrote off approximately $48.3
million and $34.4 million of rents receivable from tenants for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The write-off consists of the
following (In thousands):

Tax Allocation Agreement, Tax Stipulation and Tax Refund Escrow
Agreement
The Tax Allocation Agreement, entered into at the time of the 1998 Spin Off and
described in more detail below, was assumed by Kindred under the Kindred
Reorganization Plan and then amended and supplemented by the Tax Refund Escrow
Agreement, also described below. The Tax Stipulation, entered into by Kindred
and the Company during the pendency of the Kindred bankruptcy proceedings, was
superseded by the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement.

The Tax Allocation Agreement provides that Kindred will be liable for, and will
hold the Company harmless from and against, (i) any taxes of Kindred and its
then subsidiaries (the "Kindred Group") for periods after the 1998 Spin Off,
(ii) any taxes of the Company and its then subsidiaries (the "Company Group") or
the Kindred Group for periods prior to the 1998 Spin Off (other than taxes
associated with the Spin Off) with respect to the portion of such taxes
attributable to assets owned by the Kindred Group immediately after completion
of the 1998 Spin Off and (iii) any taxes attributable to the 1998 Spin Off to
the extent that Kindred derives certain tax benefits as a result of the payment
of such taxes. Under the Tax Allocation Agreement, Kindred would be entitled to
any refund or credit in respect of taxes owed or paid by Kindred under (i), (ii)
or (iii) above. Kindred's liability for taxes for purposes of the Tax Allocation
Agreement would be measured by the Company's actual liability for taxes after
applying certain tax benefits otherwise available to the Company other than tax
benefits that the Company in good faith determines would actually offset tax
liabilities of the Company in other taxable years or periods. Any right to a
refund for purposes of the Tax Allocation Agreement would be measured by the
actual refund or credit attributable to the adjustment without regard to
offsetting tax attributes of the Company.

Under the Tax Allocation Agreement, the Company would be liable for, and would
hold Kindred harmless against, any taxes imposed on the Company Group or the
Kindred Group other than taxes for which the Kindred Group is liable as
described in the above paragraph. The Company would be entitled to any refund or
credit for taxes owed or paid by the Company as described in this paragraph. The
Company's liability for taxes for purposes of the Tax Allocation Agreement would
be measured by the Kindred Group's actual liability for taxes after applying
certain tax benefits otherwise available to the Kindred Group other than tax
benefits that the Kindred Group in good faith determines would actually offset
tax liabilities of the Kindred Group in other taxable years or periods. Any
right to a refund would be measured by the actual refund or credit attributable
to the adjustment without regard to offsetting tax attributes of the Kindred
Group. See "Note 8 - Income Taxes."

Prior to and during the Kindred bankruptcy, the Company and Kindred were engaged
in disputes regarding the entitlement to federal, state and local tax refunds
for the Subject Periods which had been received or which would be received by
either company. Under the terms of the Tax Stipulation, the companies agreed
that the proceeds of certain federal, state and local tax refunds for the
Subject Periods, received by either company on or after September 13, 1999, with
interest thereon from the date of deposit at the lesser of the actual interest
earned and 3% per annum, were to be held by the recipient of such refunds in
segregated interest bearing accounts.

On the Kindred Effective Date, Kindred and the Company entered into the Tax
Refund Escrow Agreement governing their relative entitlement to certain tax
refunds for the Subject Periods that each received or may receive in the future.
The Tax Refund Escrow Agreement amends and supplements the Tax Allocation
Agreement and supersedes the Tax Stipulation. Under the terms of the Tax Refund
Escrow Agreement, refunds ("Subject Refunds") received on or after September 13,
1999 by either Kindred or the Company with respect to federal, state or local
income, gross receipts, windfall profits, transfer, duty,

                                                                         Page 47

value-added, property, franchise, license, excise, sales and use, capital,
employment, withholding, payroll, occupational or similar business taxes
(including interest, penalties and additions to tax, but excluding certain
refunds), for taxable periods ending on or prior to May 1, 1998, or including
May 1, 1998 and received on or after September 13, 1999 ("Subject Taxes") must
be deposited into an escrow account with a third-party escrow agent on the
Kindred Effective Date.

The Tax Refund Escrow Agreement provides, inter alia, that each party must
notify the other of any asserted Subject Tax liability of which it becomes
aware, that either party may request that asserted liabilities for Subject Taxes
be contested, that neither party may settle such a contest without the consent
of the other, that each party has the right to participate in any such contest,
and that the parties generally must cooperate with regard to Subject Taxes and
Subject Refunds and will mutually and jointly control any audit or review
process related thereto.

The funds in the escrow account (the "Escrow Funds") may be released from the
escrow account to pay Subject Taxes and as otherwise provided therein.

The Tax Refund Escrow Agreement provides generally that Kindred and the Company
waive their rights under the Tax Allocation Agreement to make claims against
each other with respect to Subject Taxes satisfied by the Escrow Funds,
notwithstanding the indemnification provisions of the Tax Allocation Agreement.
To the extent that the Escrow Funds are insufficient to satisfy all liabilities
for Subject Taxes that are finally determined to be due (such excess amount,
"Excess Taxes"), the relative liability of Kindred and the Company to pay such
Excess Taxes shall be determined as provided in the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement.
Disputes under the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement, and the determination of the
relative liability of Kindred and the Company to pay Excess Taxes, if any, are
governed by the arbitration provision of the Tax Allocation Agreement.

Interest earned on the Escrow Funds or included in refund amounts received from
governmental authorities will be distributed equally to each of Kindred and the
Company on an annual basis and are accrued as interest income on the
Consolidated Statement of Operations. Any Escrow Funds remaining in the escrow
account after no further claims may be made by governmental authorities with
respect to Subject Taxes or Subject Refunds (because of the expiration of
statutes of limitation or otherwise) will be distributed equally to Kindred and
the Company. At December 31, 2001, approximately $14.9 million of disputed
Subject Refunds and accrued interest, representing 50% of the Escrow Funds, is
recognized in restricted cash on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Agreement of Indemnity - Third Party Leases
In connection with the 1998 Spin Off, the Company assigned its former third
party lease obligations (i.e., leases under which an unrelated third party is
the landlord) as a tenant or as a guarantor of tenant obligations to Kindred
(the "Third Party Leases"). The lessors of these properties may claim that the
Company remains liable on the Third Party Leases assigned to Kindred. Under the
terms of the Agreement of Indemnity - Third Party Leases, Kindred and its
subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and
against all claims against the Company arising out of the Third Party Leases
assigned by the Company to Kindred. Either prior to or following the 1998 Spin
Off, the tenant's rights under a subset of the Third Party Leases were assigned
or sublet to third parties unrelated to Kindred (the "Subleased Third Party
Leases"). If Kindred or such third party subtenants are unable to or do not
satisfy the obligations under any Third Party Lease assigned by the Company to
Kindred, and if the lessors prevail in a claim against the Company under the
Third Party Leases, then the Company may be liable for the payment and
performance of the obligations under any such Third Party Lease. The Company
believes it may have valid legal defenses to any such claim by certain lessors
under the Third Party Leases. However, there can be no assurance the Company
would prevail in a claim brought by a lessor under a Third Party Lease. In the
event that a lessor should prevail in a claim against the Company, the Company
may be entitled to receive revenues from those properties that would mitigate
the costs incurred in connection with the satisfaction of such obligations. The
Third Party Leases relating to nursing facilities, hospitals, offices and
warehouses have remaining terms (excluding renewal periods) of 1 to 10 years.
The Third Party Leases relating to ground leases have remaining terms from 1 to
80 years. Under the Kindred Reorganization Plan, Kindred assumed and has agreed
to fulfill its obligations under the Agreement of Indemnity - Third Party
Leases. There can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets,
income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the
Agreement of Indemnity - Third Party Leases or that Kindred will continue to
honor its obligations under the Agreement of Indemnity - Third Party Leases. If
Kindred does not satisfy or otherwise honor the obligations under the Agreement
of Indemnity - Third Party Leases, then the Company may be liable for the
payment and performance of such obligations. Under the Kindred Reorganization
Plan, Kindred has agreed not to renew or extend any Third Party Lease unless it
first obtains a release of the Company from liability under such Third Party
Lease.

Agreement of Indemnity - Third Party Contracts
In connection with the 1998 Spin Off, the Company assigned its former third
party guaranty agreements to Kindred (the "Third Party Guarantees"). The Company
may remain liable on the Third Party Guarantees assigned to Kindred. Under the
terms of the Agreement of Indemnity - Third Party Contracts, Kindred and its
subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and
against all claims against the Company arising out of the Third Party Guarantees
assigned by the Company to Kindred. If Kindred is unable to or does not satisfy
the obligations under any Third Party Guarantee assigned by the Company to
Kindred, then the Company may be liable for the payment and performance of the
obligations under any such agreement.

The Third Party Guarantees were entered into in connection with certain
acquisitions and financing transactions. The Company believes that the aggregate
exposure under these guarantees is approximately $38.0 million. Under the
Kindred Reorganization Plan, Kindred assumed and has agreed to fulfill its
obligations under the Agreement of Indemnity - Third Party Contracts. There can
be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to
financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations incurred in connection with
the Agreement of Indemnity - Third Party Contracts or that Kindred will continue
to honor its obligations under the Agreement of Indemnity - Third Party
Contracts. If Kindred does not satisfy or otherwise honor the obligations under
the Agreement of Indemnity - Third Party Contracts, then the Company may be
liable for the payment and performance of such obligations.

Assumption of Certain Operating Liabilities and Litigation
In connection with the 1998 Spin Off, Kindred agreed in various Spin Agreements
to assume and to indemnify the Company for any and all liabilities that may
arise out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations either
before or after the date of the 1998 Spin Off. The indemnification provided by
Kindred also covers losses, including costs and expenses, which may arise from
any future claims asserted against the Company based on these healthcare
operations. In addition, at the time of the 1998 Spin Off, Kindred agreed to
assume the defense, on behalf of the Company, of any claims that were pending at
the time of the 1998 Spin Off, and which arose out of the ownership or operation
of the healthcare operations. Kindred also agreed to defend, on behalf of the
Company, any claims asserted after the 1998 Spin Off which arise out of the
ownership and operation of the healthcare operations. Under the Kindred
Reorganization Plan, Kindred assumed and agreed to perform its obligations under
these indemnifications. There can be no assurance that Kindred will have
sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its
obligations incurred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off or that Kindred will
continue to honor its obligations incurred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off.
If Kindred does not satisfy or otherwise honor the obligations under these
arrangements, then the Company may be liable for the payment and performance of
such obligations and may have to assume the defense of such claims.

Kindred Common Stock and Registration Rights Agreement
On the Kindred Effective Date, Ventas Realty received 1,498,500 shares of the
common stock in Kindred, representing not more than 9.99% of the issued and
outstanding common stock in Kindred as of the Kindred Effective Date. Based on
applicable laws, regulations, advice from experts, an appraisal, the trading
performance of the Kindred common stock at the applicable time and other
appropriate facts and circumstances, including the illiquidity and lack of
registration of the Kindred common stock when received and the Company's lack of
significant influence over Kindred, the Company determined that the value of the
Kindred common stock was $18.2 million on the date received by Ventas Realty.
The Kindred common stock received by Ventas Realty is subject to dilution from
stock issuances occurring after the Kindred Effective Date. The Kindred common
stock was issued to the Company as additional future rent in consideration of
the Company's agreement to charge the base rent as provided in the Master
Leases.

                                                                         Page 49

<PAGE>
Ventas, Inc. Annual Report 2001


On the Kindred Effective Date, Kindred executed and delivered to Ventas Realty
and other signatories, a Registration Rights Agreement, which, among other
things, provides that Kindred must file a shelf registration statement with
respect to the Kindred common stock and keep such registration statement
continuously effective for a period of two years with respect to such securities
(subject to customary exceptions). The shelf registration statement was declared
effective on November 7, 2001.

The Company disposed of 418,186 shares of Kindred common stock in the fourth
quarter of 2001 and recognized a gain of $15.4 million on the dispositions. In
connection with a registered offering of common stock by Kindred, Ventas Realty
exercised its piggyback registration rights, and sold 83,300 shares of Kindred
common stock, recognizing a gain of $2.6 million. The Company applied the net
proceeds of $3.6 million from the sale of the 83,300 shares of Kindred common
stock as a prepayment on the Company's indebtedness under the Credit Agreement.
The Company declared a distribution of 334,886 shares of Kindred common stock as
part of the 2001 dividend, resulting in a gain of $12.8 million. For every share
of Common Stock of the Company that a stockholder owned at the close of business
on December 14, 2001, the stockholder received 0.005 of a share of Kindred
common stock and $0.0049 in cash (equating to one share of Kindred common stock
and $0.98 in cash for every two hundred shares of Common Stock in the Company).
For purposes of the 2001 dividend, the Kindred common stock was valued in
accordance with the Code and applicable rulings and regulations on December 31,
2001 at $51.02 per share. Kindred common stock reserved for this dividend is
segregated on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2001.

Terminated Agreements
The Participation Agreement and the Development Agreement, both executed in
connection with the 1998 Spin Off, were terminated on the Kindred Effective
Date. The Second Standstill Agreement and the Tolling Agreement, both entered
into by the Company and Kindred in April 1999, and the Tax Stipulation and the
Rent Stipulation were all terminated on the Kindred Effective Date and are of no
further force or effect.

Settlement of United States Claims
Kindred and the Company were the subject of investigations by the United States
Department of Justice regarding the Company's prior healthcare operations,
including matters arising from lawsuits filed under the qui tam, or
whistleblower, provision of the Federal Civil False Claims Act, which allows
private citizens to bring a suit in the name of the United States. See "Note 12
- - Litigation." The Kindred Reorganization Plan contains a comprehensive
settlement of all of these claims by the United States (the "United States
Settlement").

Under the United States Settlement, the Company will pay $103.6 million to the
United States, of which $34.0 million was paid on the Kindred Effective Date.
The balance of $69.6 million bears interest at 6% per annum and is payable in
equal quarterly installments over a five-year term commencing on June 30, 2001
and ending in 2006. The Company made the first three quarterly installments
under the United States Settlement through December 31, 2001.

The Company also paid approximately $0.4 million to legal counsel for the
relators in the qui tam actions. In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company
recorded the full amount of the obligation under the United States Settlement
for $96.5 million based on an imputed interest rate of 10.75%.

Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies
The Company has a third party obligation that arises out of certain bonds that
were, and may continue to be, issued by the Company to residents of an assisted
living facility that is owned by the Company, and leased to and operated by
Atria, Inc. ("Atria"). Proceeds from the bonds are paid to and utilized by
Atria. The obligation to repay the bonds is secured by a certain Mortgage and
Trust Indenture (the "Atria Mortgage") that encumbers (among other property) the
assisted living facility. Based solely upon the most current information
obtained by the Company from Atria, the Company believes that the aggregate
principal amount of the indebtedness evidenced by the bonds is currently
approximately $29.4 million. Pursuant to a series of documents and instruments
executed in connection with the Company's spin off of its assisted living
operations and related assets and liabilities to Atria in 1996, including the
lease by and between Atria and the Company (the "Atria Lease"), Atria has
assumed and agreed to repay the indebtedness evidenced by the bonds and has
agreed to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and against all amounts
the Company may be obligated to pay under the Atria Mortgage, including the
obligation to repay the bonds. The Company may remain the primary obligor under
the bonds and the Atria Mortgage. If Atria is unable or unwilling to satisfy
these obligations, the Company may be liable for such obligations. There can be
no assurance that Atria will have sufficient assets, income and access to
financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Atria Mortgage and
the bonds or that Atria will continue to honor its obligations under the Atria
Mortgage and the bonds. The payment or performance of these obligations by the
Company could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company is
currently engaged in efforts to have itself released from liability under the
bonds and the Atria Mortgage. A lawsuit is pending between Atria and the Company
wherein Atria is seeking, among other things, a declaration that Atria's
indemnity obligation in favor of the Company relative to the bonds is void and
unenforceable. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be
successful in its attempts to be released from this liability. See "Note 12 -
Litigation - Other Litigation."

The Company may be subject to certain liabilities assumed by Kindred in
connection with the 1998 Spin Off. See "Note 9 -Transactions with Kindred."

Options to purchase 3.1 million shares of Common Stock ranging from $10.8125 to

Note 12 - Litigation
Legal Proceedings Defended and Indemnified by Kindred Under the Spin
Agreements
The following litigation and other matters arose from the Company's operations
prior to the 1998 Spin Off or relate to assets or liabilities transferred to
Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off. Under the Spin Agreements, Kindred
agreed to assume the defense, on behalf of the Company, of any claims that (a)
were pending at the time of the 1998 Spin Off and which arose out of the
ownership or operation of the healthcare operations or any of the assets or
liabilities transferred to Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off, or (b)
were asserted after the 1998 Spin Off and which arose out of the ownership and
operation of the healthcare operations or any of the assets or liabilities
transferred to Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off, and to indemnify
the Company for any fees, costs, expenses and liabilities arising out of such
operations (the "Indemnification"). Kindred is presently defending the Company
in the matters described below. Under the Kindred Reorganization Plan, Kindred
assumed and agreed to abide by the Indemnification and to defend the Company in
these and other matters as required under the Spin Agreements. See "Note 9 -
Transactions with Kindred - Assumption of Certain Operating Liabilities and
Litigation." However, there

can be no assurance that Kindred will continue to defend the Company in such
matters or that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to
financing to enable it to satisfy such obligations or its obligations incurred
in connection with the 1998 Spin Off. In addition, many of the following
descriptions are based primarily on information included in Kindred's public
filings and information provided to the Company by Kindred. There can be no
assurance that Kindred has provided the Company with complete and accurate
information in all instances.

A class action lawsuit entitled A. Carl Helwig v. Vencor, Inc. et al. was filed
on December 24, 1997 in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Kentucky (Civil Action No. 3-97CV-8354). The putative class action
claims were brought by an alleged stockholder of the Company against the Company
and certain executive officers and directors of the Company. The complaint
alleges that the Company and certain current and former executive officers of
the Company during a specified time frame violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of
the Exchange Act, by, among other things, issuing to the investing public a
series of false and misleading statements concerning the Company's current
operations and the inherent value of the Company's Common Stock. The complaint
further alleges that as a result of these purported false and misleading
statements concerning the Company's revenues and successful acquisitions, the
price of the Company's Common Stock was artificially inflated. The suit seeks
damages in an amount to be proven at trial, pre-judgment and post-judgment
interest, reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees and other costs, and
any extraordinary equitable and/or injunctive relief permitted by law or equity
to assure that the plaintiff has an effective remedy. On December 27, 2001, the
parties filed a motion for the District Court to approve a settlement among the
parties requiring the payment of $3.0 million to the certified class. The
proposed settlement does not require any payments by the Company. A hearing to
consider the settlement has been scheduled for May 13, 2002. There can be no
assurance the settlement will be approved by the District Court. If the
settlement is not approved by the District Court, Kindred, on behalf of the
Company, intends to continue to defend this action vigorously.

A stockholder derivative suit entitled Thomas G. White on behalf of Kindred,
Inc. and Ventas, Inc. v. W. Bruce Lunsford, et al., Case No. 98 C103669 was
filed in June 1998 in the Jefferson County, Kentucky, Circuit Court. The suit
purports to have been brought on behalf of Kindred and the Company against
certain current and former executive officers and directors of Kindred and the
Company. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants damaged
Kindred and the Company by engaging in violations of the securities laws,
including engaging in insider trading, fraud and securities fraud and damaging
the reputation of Kindred and the Company. The plaintiff asserts that such
actions were taken deliberately, in bad faith and constitute breaches of the
defendants' duties of loyalty and due care. The suit seeks unspecified damages,
interest, punitive damages, reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees and
other costs, and any extraordinary equitable and/or injunctive relief permitted
by law or equity to assure that the plaintiff has an effective remedy. The
Company believes that the allegations in the complaint are without merit.
Kindred has informed the Company that it also believes the allegations in the
complaint are without merit, and intends to defend this action vigorously for
and on behalf of the Company.

A class action lawsuit entitled Sally Pratt, et al. v. Ventas, Inc. et al. was
filed on May 25, 2001 in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Kentucky (Civil Action No. 3-01CV-317-H). The putative class action
complaint alleges that the Company and certain current and former officers and
employees of the Company engaged in a fraudulent scheme to conceal the true
nature and substance of the 1998 Spin Off resulting in (a) a violation of the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, (b) bankruptcy fraud, (c)
common law fraud, and (d) a deprivation of plaintiffs' civil rights. The
plaintiffs allege that the defendants failed to act affirmatively to explain and
disclose the fact that the Company was the entity that had been known as Vencor,
Inc. prior to the 1998 Spin Off and that a new separate and distinct legal
entity assumed the name of Vencor, Inc. after the 1998 Spin Off. The plaintiffs
contend that the defendants filed misleading documents in the plaintiffs' state
court lawsuits that were pending at the time of the 1998 Spin Off and that the
defendants deceptively used the bankruptcy proceedings of Vencor, Inc. (now
known as Kindred Healthcare, Inc.) to stay lawsuits against the Company. As a
result of these actions, the plaintiffs maintain that they and similarly
situated individuals suffered and will continue to suffer severe financial harm.
The suit seeks compensatory damages (trebled with interest), actual and punitive
damages, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expenses, declaratory and
injunctive and any and all other relief to which the plaintiffs may be entitled.
This action was dismissed in its entirety on February 4, 2002. The plaintiffs
filed a motion requesting that the dismissal be altered to allow the plaintiffs
to resume this action if they are unable to obtain relief in the Kindred
proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court. The plaintiffs have filed a motion with the
Kindred Bankruptcy Court requesting, among other things, that the Kindred
Bankruptcy Court set aside portions of the releases of the Company contained in
the Kindred Reorganization Plan, as such releases apply to the plaintiffs.
Kindred, on behalf of the Company, is vigorously contesting these motions.

Kindred and the Company were informed by the Department of Justice that they
were the subject of ongoing investigations into various aspects of the Company's
former healthcare operations. In the United States Settlement, documented in the
Kindred Reorganization Plan, the United States, the Company and Kindred resolved
all claims arising out of the investigations by the Department of Justice and
the Office of Inspector General including the pending qui tam, or whistleblower,
actions. Under the United States Settlement, the United States was required to
move to dismiss with prejudice to the United States and the relators (except for
certain claims which will be dismissed without

prejudice to the United States in certain of the cases) the pending qui tam
actions as against the Company, Kindred and any current or former officers,
directors and employees of either entity. All pending qui tam actions against
the Company have been resolved and dismissed by the United States Settlement.

Kindred is a party to certain legal actions and regulatory investigations
arising in the normal course of its business. The Company is a party to certain
legal actions and regulatory investigations that arise from the normal course of
its prior healthcare operations which legal actions and regulatory
investigations are being defended by Kindred under the Indemnification. Neither
the Company nor Kindred is able to predict the ultimate outcome of pending
litigation and regulatory investigations. In addition, there can be no assurance
that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly known as United
States Healthcare Financing Administration) ("CMS") or other regulatory agencies
will not initiate additional investigations related to Kindred's business or the
Company's prior healthcare business in the future, nor can there be any
assurance that the resolution of any litigation or investigations, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on
Kindred's liquidity, financial position or results of operations, which in turn
could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Unasserted Claims - Potential Liabilities Due to Fraudulent Transfer
Considerations, Legal Dividend Requirements and Other Claims

The Company
The 1998 Spin Off, including the simultaneous distribution of the Kindred common
stock to the Ventas stockholders (the "Distribution"), is subject to review
under fraudulent conveyance laws. In addition, the 1998 Spin Off is subject to
review under state corporate distribution and dividend statutes. Under Delaware
law, a corporation may not pay a dividend to its stockholders if (i) the net
assets of the corporation do not exceed its capital, unless the amount proposed
to be paid as a dividend is less than the corporation's net profits for the
current and/or preceding fiscal year in which the dividend is to be paid, or
(ii) the capital of the corporation is less than the aggregate amount allocable
to all classes of its stock. The Company believes that the Distribution was
proper and that the 1998 Spin Off was consummated entirely in compliance with
Delaware law. There is no certainty, however, that a court would reach the same
conclusions in determining whether the Company was insolvent at the time of, or
after giving effect to, the 1998 Spin Off or whether lawful funds were available
for the 1998 Spin Off.

Other Legal Proceedings
The Company and Atria, Inc. ("Atria") have been engaged in ongoing discussions
regarding the parties' respective rights and obligations relative to the
issuance of mortgage resident bonds (the "Bonds") to the new residents of New
Pond Village, a senior housing facility in Walpole, Massachusetts, owned by the
Company and leased to and operated by Atria. See "Note 10 - Commitment and
Contingencies." On August 6, 2001, Atria filed a lawsuit styled Atria, Inc. v.
Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership in the Superior Court Department of the Trial
Court in Norfolk County, Massachusetts (Civil Action Number 01 01233). The
complaint alleges that the Company has a duty to sign and issue Bonds to new
residents of New Pond Village and that, as a result of an alleged failure of the
Company to issue Bonds, the Company has, among other things, breached
contractual obligations under the Bond Indenture. The complaint seeks a
declaration that Atria's indemnity obligation in favor of the Company relating
to the Bonds is void and unenforceable and injunctive and declaratory relief
requiring the Company to sign and issue Bonds to new residents of New Pond
Village. The complaint also seeks damages, interest, attorneys' fees and other
costs. The Company believes that the allegations in the complaint are without
merit. The Company's motion to dismiss was denied by trial court. The trial
court's decision was affirmed by an appellate court on January 24, 2002. The
Company has asserted counterclaims against Atria and the Company intends to
defend this action and pursue its counterclaims vigorously.

The Company is a plaintiff in an action seeking a declaratory judgment and
damages entitled Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership et al. v. Black Diamond CLO
1998-1 Ltd., et al., Case No. 99C107076, filed November 22, 1999 in the Circuit
Court of Jefferson County, Kentucky. Two of the three defendants in that action,
Black Diamond International Funding, Ltd. and BDC Finance, LLC (collectively
"Black Diamond"), have asserted counterclaims against the Company under theories
of breach of contract, tortious interference with contract and abuse of process.
These counterclaims allege, among other things, that the Company wrongfully, and
in violation of the terms of the Prior Credit Agreement, (a) failed to recognize
an assignment to Black Diamond of certain notes issued under the Prior Credit
Agreement, (b) failed to issue to Black Diamond new notes under the Prior Credit
Agreement, and (c) executed the Waiver and Extension Agreement between the
Company and its lenders in October 1999. The counterclaims further claim that
the Company acted tortiously in commencing the action against the defendants.
The counterclaims seek damages of $11,796,875 (the principal amount of the
Company's Bridge Loan under the Prior Credit Agreement claimed to have been held
by Black Diamond), plus interest, costs and fees, and additional unspecified
amounts to be proven at trial; in addition Black Diamond is seeking a
declaration that the 1999 Waiver and Extension Agreement is void and
unenforceable.

The Company disputes the material allegations contained in Black Diamond's
counterclaims and the Company intends to pursue its claims and defend the
counterclaims vigorously.

The Company is party to various lawsuits arising in the normal course of the
Company's business. It is the opinion of management that, except as set forth in
this Note 12, the disposition of these lawsuits will not, individually or in the
aggregate, have

                                                                         Page 53

Ventas, Inc. Annual Report 2001

a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. If management's assessment of the
Company's liability with respect to these actions is incorrect such lawsuits
could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Except for the United States Settlement, no provision for liability, if any,
resulting from the aforementioned litigation has been made in the consolidated
financial statements as of December 31, 2001.

Note 13 - Capital Stock
The authorized capital stock of the Company at December 31, 2001 and 2000
consisted of 180,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value of $0.25 per share,
and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock of which 300,000 shares have been
designated Series A Participating Preferred Stock.

In order to preserve the Company's ability to maintain REIT status, the
Company's certificate of incorporation provides that if a person acquires
beneficial ownership of greater than 9% of the outstanding stock of the Company,
the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of such 9% limit are deemed to
be "Excess Shares." Excess Shares are automatically deemed transferred to a
trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying
organization selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. The trust is
entitled to all dividends with respect to the Excess Shares and the trustee may
exercise all voting power over the Excess Shares.

The Company has the right to buy the Excess Shares for a purchase price equal to
the lesser of (1) the price per share in the transaction that created the Excess
Shares, or (2) the market price on the date the Company buys the shares. The
Company has the right to defer payment of the purchase price for the Excess
Shares for up to five years. If the Company does not purchase the Excess Shares,
the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the Excess Shares at the
direction of the Board of Directors. The owner of the Excess Shares is entitled
to receive the lesser of the proceeds from the sale of the Excess Shares or the
original purchase price for such Excess Shares; any additional amounts are
payable to the beneficiary of the trust.

Under the Company's certificate of incorporation, certain holders ("Existing
Holders") who owned the Company's Common Stock in excess of the foregoing limits
on the date of the 1998 Spin Off, are not subject to the general ownership
limits applicable to other stockholders. Existing Holders are generally
permitted to own up to the same percentage of the Company's Common Stock that
was owned on the date of the 1998 Spin Off, provided such ownership does not
jeopardize the Company's status as a REIT. The only Existing Holder is Tenet
Healthcare Corporation ("Tenet"). Since the date of the 1998 Spin Off, Tenet has
owned approximately 12% of the Company's Common Stock. There are certain
provisions under the Code that provide that any ownership interest that Tenet
may purchase in Kindred may be attributed to the Company. If as a result of any
such attribution, the Company is deemed to own 10% or more of the issued and
outstanding Kindred common stock, the Company may lose its REIT status. Under
the Company's certificate of incorporation, under a formal interpretation by the
Board of Directors, if Tenet purchases any Kindred common stock while Tenet owns
10% or more of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Stock, then all of
Tenet's holdings of the Company's Common Stock in excess of 9.99% will
automatically become "Excess Shares" in the Company and will be deemed to be
owned by a trust for the benefit of a third party and Tenet will have no legal
title to such "Excess Shares" in the Company. Tenet would have the limited right
to receive certain distributions on and a certain portion of the proceeds of a
sale of such "Excess Shares" in the Company. The Company believes that, based
upon applicable tax authorities and decisions and advice from the Internal
Revenue Service, all common stock underlying warrants and options issued by
Kindred and performance shares issued by Kindred will be deemed outstanding for
purposes of calculating the Company's ownership percentage under the 10%
securities test. In addition, since the Kindred Effective Date, Kindred issued
additional shares of Kindred common stock and the Company disposed of 418,186
shares of Kindred common stock, so that as of January 27, 2002 Ventas Realty
owned not more than 6.2% of the issued and outstanding stock of Kindred.
Accordingly, the Company believes that for purposes of the 10% securities test,
its ownership percentage in Kindred has been and will continue to be materially
less than 9.99%.

The Company's Board of Directors is empowered to grant waivers from the "Excess
Share" provisions of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation. One such waiver
is currently in effect permitting a stockholder to own over 9% of the Common
Stock but in no event more than 9.9% of the Common Stock as measured by the
Code. The Company believes that no stockholder, other than Tenet, currently owns
10% or more of the Common Stock as measured by the Code.

The Company has issued Preferred Stock Purchase Rights (the "Rights") pursuant
to the terms of the Rights Agreement, dated July 20, 1993, as amended, with
National City Bank as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement"). Under the terms of
the Rights Agreement, the Company declared a dividend of one Right for each
outstanding share of Common Stock of the Company to common stockholders of
record on August 1, 1993. Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from the
Company one-hundredth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock at a purchase price
of $110. A total of 300,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock are subject to
the Rights.

The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects and are intended to cause
substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company
without conditioning the offer on the Rights being redeemed or a substantial
number of the Rights being acquired.

Under the terms of the Rights Agreement, if at such time as any person becomes
the beneficial owner of 9.9% or more of the Common Stock (an "Acquiring
Person"), (i) the Company is involved in a merger or other business combination
in which the Common Stock is exchanged or changed (other than a merger with a
person or group which both (a) acquired Common Stock pursuant to a Permitted
Offer (as defined below) and (b) is offering not less than the price paid
pursuant to the Permitted Offer and the same form of consideration paid in the
Permitted Offer) or (ii) 50% or more of the Company's assets or earning power
are sold, the Rights become exercisable for that number of shares of common
stock of the acquiring company which at the time of such transaction would have
a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right (such right being
called the "Flip-over"). A "Permitted Offer" is a tender or exchange offer which
is for all outstanding shares of Common Stock at a price and on terms
determined, prior to the purchase of shares under such tender or exchange offer,
by at least a majority of the members of the Board of Directors who are not
officers of the Company and who are not Acquiring Persons or affiliates,
associates, nominees or representatives of an Acquiring Person, to be adequate
and otherwise in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders (other
than the person or any affiliate or associate thereof on whose behalf the offer
is being made) taking into account all factors that such directors deem
relevant.

In the event any person becomes an Acquiring Person, for a 60 day period after
such event, if the Flip-over right is not also triggered, the Rights become
exercisable for that number of shares of Common Stock having a market value of
two times the exercise price of the Right, to the extent available, and then
(after all authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock have been issued), a
common stock equivalent having a market value of two times the exercise price of
the Right.

Upon any person becoming an Acquiring Person (other than pursuant to a Permitted
Offer), any rights issued to or beneficially owned by such Acquiring Person
become null and void and thereafter may not be transferred to any other person.

Certain persons and transactions are exempted from the operation of the Rights.
Prior to a person becoming an Acquiring Person, the Board has the power to amend
the Rights Agreement or cause the redemption of the Rights, at a purchase price
of $0.01 in cash per Right. After the time a person becomes an Acquiring Person,
the Board can only amend the Rights Agreement to make changes that do not
adversely affect the interests of the holders of Rights. For purposes of the
Rights Agreement a person is not deemed to be the beneficial owner of securities
designated as Excess Shares under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation.

The Company's Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the "Plan" or
"DRIP") was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on
December 31, 2001. Under the Plan's terms, existing stockholders may purchase
shares of Common Stock in the Company by reinvesting all or a portion of the
cash distribution on their shares of the Company's Common Stock. In addition,
existing stockholders of the Company, as well as new investors may purchase
shares of Common Stock in the Company by making optional cash payments.

Note 14 - Related Party Transactions
At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had receivables of approximately $3.6
million and $3.4 million, respectively, due from certain current and former
executive officers of the Company. The loans include interest provisions (with a
5.7% average rate) and were to finance the income taxes payable by the executive
officers resulting from: (i) the 1998 Spin Off and (ii) vesting of Restricted
Shares. The loans are payable over periods ranging from four years to ten years
with the majority of the obligations amortizing quarterly. Interest expense on
the 1998 Spin Off note in the principal amount of $2.6 million at December 31,
2001, is forgiven on a periodic basis, provided that the officer remains an
employee of the Company (the "1998 Spin Off Note"). Interest expense on the note
relating to taxes paid for the vested portion of Restricted Shares (the
"Restricted Share Note") is payable annually out of and only to the extent of
dividends from the vested restricted shares. In the event of a change in control
of the Company (as defined in the relevant employment agreement) or upon
termination of the officer without cause (as defined in the relevant employment
agreement), the principal balance of the Restricted Share Note is forgiven. The
Restricted Share Note is secured by a pledge of all of the restricted shares to
which the Restricted Share Note relates and the Restricted Share Note is
otherwise non-recourse. The 1998 Spin Off Note is not secured.

On October 15, 1998, the Company acquired eight personal care facilities and
related facilities for approximately $7.1 million from Tangram Rehabilitation
Network, Inc. ("Tangram"). Tangram is a wholly owned subsidiary of Res-Care,
Inc. ("Res-Care") of which a director of the Company is the Chairman, President
and Chief Executive Officer and another director of the Company is a member of
its board of directors. The Company leases the Tangram facilities to Tangram
pursuant to a master lease agreement which is guaranteed by Res-Care. For the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, Tangram has paid the Company
approximately $779,000, $754,000 and $733,800, respectively, in rent payments.

                                                                         Page 55

Ventas, Inc. Annual Report 2001


On February 29, 2000, the Company entered into a Separation and Release
Agreement (the "Separation Agreement") with the former Executive Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") of the Company. The Separation Agreement was
entered into in connection with his resignation as Executive Vice President and
CFO of the Company, effective February 9, 2000 (the "Termination Date"). The
Separation Agreement provided for a lump sum severance payment of approximately
$510,000 and certain other consideration from the Company, and an extension of
certain employee benefits for a one-year period following the Termination Date.

The Company entered into a Separation Agreement and Release of Claims (the "Ladt
Separation Agreement ") with Thomas T. Ladt pursuant to which Mr. Ladt resigned
as President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of the Company
and from the Board of Directors of the Company as of March 5, 1999. The Ladt
Separation Agreement provides for a lump sum payment of approximately $1.3
million and certain other consideration from the Company, and an extension of
certain employee benefits for a two-year period following the date of his
resignation. The Company further agreed to amend a tax loan that the Company had
made to Mr. Ladt to provide that no principal or interest payments would be due
under such tax loan prior to March 5, 2004.

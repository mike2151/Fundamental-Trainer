<li><h5>Third party sites and advertisers</h5>
<p>Investment Trainer may include links to third party websites. Some of these sites may contain materials that are objectionable, unlawful, or inaccurate. You agree that Investment Trainer shall not be held liable for any trading activities or other activities that occur on any website you access through links on Investment Trainer. We provide these links as a convenience, and do not endorse the content or services offered by these other sites. Any dealings that you have with advertisers found on Investment Trainer are between you and the advertiser and you acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss or claim you may have against an advertiser.

<li><h5>Disclaimer regarding content</h5>
<p>Investment Trainer cannot and does not represent or guarantee that any of the information available through our services or on Investment Trainer is accurate, reliable, current, complete or appropriate for your needs. Various information available through our services or on Investment Trainer may be specially obtained by Investment Trainer from professional businesses or organizations, such as exchanges, news providers, market data providers and other content providers (e.g. Cboe BZX and possibly other established financial exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, New York Mercantile Exchange and Dow Jones), who are believed to be sources of reliable information (collectively, the "Data Providers"). Nevertheless, due to various factors — including the inherent possibility of human and mechanical error — the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, results obtained from use, and correct sequencing of information available through our services and website are not and cannot be guaranteed by Investment Trainer. We make no warranty and assume no obligation or liability for scripts, indicators, ideas and other content of third parties. Your use of any third-party scripts, indicators, ideas and other content is at your sole risk.</p></li>
<li><h5>Disclaimer regarding investment decisions and trading</h5>
<p>Decisions to buy, sell, hold or trade in securities, commodities and other investments involve risk and are best made based on the advice of qualified financial professionals. Any trading in securities or other investments involves a risk of substantial losses. The practice of "Day Trading" involves particularly high risks and can cause you to lose substantial sums of money. Before undertaking any trading program, you should consult a qualified financial professional. Please consider carefully whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition and ability to bear financial risks. Under no circumstances shall we be liable for any loss or damage you or anyone else incurs as a result of any trading or investment activity that you or anyone else engages in based on any information or material you receive through Investment Trainer or our services.</p></li>
<li><h5>Disclaimer regarding hypothetical performance results</h5>
<p>Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are mentioned below. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program.
One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of the trading losses are material points, which can also adversely affect trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the market in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.</p></li>


<li><h5>Access and security</h5>
<p>You accept responsibility for the confidentiality and use of any username, and email address that you may register for your access to and use of our services. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify  Investment Trainer of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session.

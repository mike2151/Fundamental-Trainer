Item 6 Ownership of More than Five Percent on Behalf of Another
       Person

       (1) Price Associates does not serve as custodian of the
           assets of any of its clients; accordingly, in each
           instance only the client or the client's custodian or
           trustee bank has the right to receive dividends paid
           with respect to, and proceeds from the sale of, such
           securities.

           The ultimate power to direct the receipt of dividends
           paid with respect to, and the proceeds from the sale
           of, such securities, is vested in the individual and
           institutional clients which Price Associates serves as
           investment adviser.  Any and all discretionary
           authority which has been delegated to Price Associates
           may be revoked in whole or in part at any time.

           Except as may be indicated if this is a joint filing
           with one of the registered investment companies
           sponsored by Price Associates which it also serves as
           investment adviser ("T. Rowe Price Funds"), not more
           than 5% of the class of such securities is owned by
           any one client subject to the investment advice of
           Price Associates.

       (2) With respect to securities owned by any one of the T.
           Rowe Price Funds, only State Street Bank and Trust
           Company, as custodian for each of such Funds, has the
           right to receive dividends paid with respect to, and
           proceeds from the sale of, such securities.  No other
           person is known to have such right, except that the
           shareholders of each such Fund participate
           proportionately in any dividends and distributions so
           paid.

         By signing below I (we) certify that, to the best of my
         (our) knowledge and belief, the securities referred to
         above were acquired in the ordinary course of business
         and were not acquired for the purpose of and do not have
         the effect of changing or influencing the control of the

         filing of this Schedule 13G shall not be construed as an
         admission that Price Associates is the beneficial owner

         ownership is expressly denied.

                            Signature.

         After reasonable inquiry and to the best of my (our)
         knowledge and belief, I (we) certify that the
         information set forth in this statement is true,
         complete and correct.

Competition

achieved a unique or leadership position in their market.
However, the Company encounters competition in varying degrees in
all product groups and for each product line.  Competitors include
domestic and foreign producers of the same and similar products.
The principal methods of competition are price, delivery schedule,
quality of services, product performance and other terms and
conditions of sale.  During fiscal 1999, the Company invested
$16,824,000 in new plant and equipment in order to upgrade
facilities to become more competitive in all segments.

International Operations

     Substantially all international operations of the Company are
related to domestic operations and are included in the Food
Service and Industrial business segments.  International
operations are conducted at 34 plants, principally in Western
Europe.  The industry segment information regarding non-U.S.
operations on page 27 of the 1999 Annual Report is incorporated
herein by reference.

Research and Development

     Due to the nature of the manufacturing operations of Standex
and the types of products manufactured, expenditures for research
and development are not material to any segment.

Environmental and Other Matters

     To the best of its knowledge, the Company believes that it is
presently in substantial compliance with all existing applicable
environmental laws and does not anticipate that such compliance
will have a material effect on its future capital expenditures,
earnings or competitive position.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

1999 HIGHLIGHTS
Standex is a global, multi-industry company that manufactures and markets
products through 16 business units and 92 facilities in 14 countries. Our
strategy is to make synergistic acquisitions and invest in businesses that
generate solid revenues and earnings streams, and then to reinvest for long-
term growth - while providing attractive current returns to our
shareholders.

We operate in three broad business segments. Our Food Service and Consumer
businesses are well positioned to capitalize on trends that reflect new
ways of living, working, and shopping. Our Industrial businesses typically
serve niche OEM markets, so many of our products and services are invisible
to consumers and end-users. Yet we typically add functionality, competitive
advantage and market appeal that are critical to the quality and value of
the finished product.

Standex International. We make essential products that add value to your

To Our Shareholders,

HIGHLIGHTS

Record sales ($641.4 million) and the second highest historical earnings
($31.4 million) highlighted Fiscal 1999. Last year we indicated that 1998
was a transition year and the refocusing should begin to manifest itself in
Fiscal 1999. It did. We have assimilated the acquisitions of ACME
Manufacturing and ATR Coil Company, divested three business units and
closed one manufacturing plant. Management realignment has been
accomplished and a new performance driven management planning and
compensation program has been implemented.

The Stock Market made a major adjustment to small capitalization stocks
like Standex, which dropped small cap values as much as 50% in just a few
weeks. While our stock has recovered some of its lost value, we have not
returned to our year ago levels in spite of improved performance. We
believe that over time the market cycle will improve and our stock should
rebound accordingly. In the meantime, we must concentrate on continuous
productivity improvements, increasing sales and earnings from existing
operations, and finding synergistic strategic acquisitions to fuel our
growth in the years ahead.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Book Value Per Share reached a new record at $12.59 and the debt-to-capital
ratio was reduced from 53.2% to 48.4%. Return on Sales was 4.9% and Return
on Equity was 19.3%. Cash Flow as measured by EBITDA, improved $18.7
million and the current ratio stands at 2.8 to 1.

Capital Expenditures needed to provide growth and support our existing
business units remained relatively high at $16.8 million, and we
repurchased 314,000 shares of Standex Common Stock. While considerable time
was allocated to the reorganization and refocusing discussed above; we did
make two small acquisitions that should improve the technological base of
our operating businesses in the near future. We have delivered nine
consecutive quarters of increased year over year earnings comparisons and
have paid continuous quarterly dividends for 35 years. The financial
strength of the Company is very solid going into the new century.

OUTLOOK

The business climate at the present time is a two-edged sword. The economy
is strong, creating demand; inflation is low which keeps raw materials
prices down but makes price increases difficult for us to obtain. In fact,
major consolidations and the lower cost of imports due to Asian
overcapacity has many US manufacturers in a deflationary cycle.
Unemployment is low making it difficult to find qualified labor and
pressure on higher wages is building. Nevertheless, we have shown that by
prudent investments and a disciplined acquisition policy we can maintain or
improve our Gross Profit Margins which this year overall remained stable at
33% of sales in spite of an earnings problem at one of our larger
divisions. The focus for FY 2000 will be on solidifying the changes already
implemented, and providing strategic direction that will emphasize growth
in the years ahead.

We would be remiss if we did not recognize the contributions of our
employees and the guidance of our directors in making 1999 a successful
year.

ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS FOR THE WORLD OF FOOD SERVICE

[Photo:  Chef Harry Green in the kitchen of St. Francis Hospital]

Imagine how food freshness, flavor, texture and appeal are enhanced by
Standex...
 ...adding to your enjoyment of a soft drink, delight in a pastry or
satisfaction and convenience when you purchase a prepared meal at your
supermarket. You may not even realize how often you're being served with
the help of a Standex product: that your pastry was displayed in a case
made by a Standex company, that your espresso was brewed with the help of
one of our pumps or that the ready-to-eat dinner you brought home last
night was prepared using Standex food preparation equipment.

Chances are good that Standex companies help you savor life a bit more
every day.

You'll find the products of the Standex Food Service Group in supermarkets,
gourmet shops, convenience stores, bakeries, and even institutional
kitchens, satisfying the changing tastes and more sophisticated palettes of
today's time-pressed, convenience-oriented consumers.

For example, today's dual-earner families typically enjoy higher incomes,
but they also have less and less time for shopping, cooking and traditional
family meals. The result: a growing trend in the US and Europe called home
meal replacement (HMR). If you've ever stopped at a market or restaurant
after work to "pick up supper" and brought home a complete meal to go,
you're part of the HMR trend. And your meal may have been prepared with the
help of commercial food preparation equipment made by our BKI unit -
including ovens/rotisseries, pressure fryers, and low-temperature cook-and-
hold ovens and heated display cases. Today, these systems are installed in
thousands of supermarkets, restaurants, institutional food kitchens,
delicatessens and convenience stores. Managed as a single global business,
BKI Worldwide has manufacturing locations in the US and England, as well as
distribution networks in dynamic Far Eastern and South American markets.

You may also have benefited from Standex food preparation technology at
breakfast or lunch. Did you have an espresso or soft drink? The dispensing
machines may have used a pump from our Procon Products unit. This global
company, with operations in Europe and the US, uses state-of-the-art
manufacturing techniques, including robotic systems and direct numerical
control computer technologies, to maximize efficiency and quality and
provide additional capacity to meet rising demand.

If you selected a food item from a refrigerated or heated display case,
Standex's Master-Bilt or Federal Industries units may well have built that
system. Master-Bilt's refrigerated cabinets, cases, display units and
modular walk-in refrigerators/freezers can be found in restaurants,
supermarkets, pharmacies and convenience stores across the country. One of
the first companies to provide precise temperature control for truly
healthful refrigeration, Master-Bilt is a leader in designing equipment
that maximizes food safety by minimizing temperature fluctuations in all
types of merchandising and storage environments.

Federal Industries is an established leader in merchandising and display
cases for restaurants, supermarkets, convenience stores, bakeries, delis
and confectionery shops. For over 60 years, the company has built a strong
market position by custom designing and manufacturing modular merchandising
and presentation centers that match the retailer's concept. The result: our
customers increase sales because their products are presented distinctively
and attractively.

We're even helping to increase the appeal of the food served by hospitals,
schools and colleges, correctional facilities and other institutions where
food may be prepared at one location and served at another. Our Unitron V
Feeding System manufactured by our USECO division was the first US system
to introduce convection reheating technology, which uses circulating air to
reheat chilled foods, combined with standard conduction techniques, which
heat the serving plate. Not only are more of the food's texture and flavor
preserved, but both hot and cold food temperatures can be maintained on the
same tray.

ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS FOR THE WORLD OF INDUSTRY
[Photo:  A man using a cell phone with a car next to him and a factory
         and street behind him.]

Imagine the many ways that Standex makes your industrial products more
useful and competitive...with textures that make your products more
appealing and distinctive, electronic devices that make the OEM components
you manufacture more functional and easier to assemble, including exotic
metals and precisely machined fuel tank domes for satellite launch
vehicles. The things we make and do - and the quality and innovation that
distinguish us - add value and functionality to industrial products in a
host of settings, from the construction and automotive industries, to
aerospace, telecommunications, packaging and consumer goods.

The Standex name may be invisible to the end-user, but the functionality
and value we add give products a distinctive edge.

Regardless of the industry, companies are faced with a daily challenge: how
to compete effectively in an environment that is increasingly
sophisticated, constantly accelerating and always cost-conscious. The
companies of the Standex Industrial Group understand the challenge - and
deliver customer solutions everyday that can enhance the appeal of our
customers' products, enhance the speed and efficiency of the manufacturing
process and help add value to our customers' products in the marketplace.

Consider one of the most basic - but subtle - of all product
characteristics: texture. Standex is the world leader in texturizing:
creating the three-dimensional surfaces that make products more appealing,
easier to grasp and use - and sell. We not only understand current end-user
needs and expectations, but also the competitive environment in which our
customers operate. To help our customers compete, we've shortened the time
it takes for us to apply a texture to their product, or to deliver a
complete, new texturizing system for use in the customer's own plant.

For example, our Roehlen Embossing unit creates and delivers texturizing
systems that produce textured designs: rolls, plates and machines apply
textures and patterns to products like vinyl siding, wall coverings, fine
writing papers, even the leather basketballs and footballs that are used by
professionals and neighborhood kids alike. Similarly, our Mold-Tech unit -
with 18 facilities and 3 licensees in 15 countries, the only truly global
texturizing resource - has installed the industry's most advanced optical
imaging systems, allowing OEMs and marketers to incorporate new patterns
and textures into their designs in a matter of days.

Another Standex unit, James Burn, is a leader in the related graphic arts
area. The Unit's premier brand Wire-O(R) double-loop wire binding system is
specified by designers worldwide, who use it to add a creative edge as well
as flexibility to manuals, calendars, diaries, brochures and other printed
materials. Chances are, there is a Wire-O(R) bound publication in your office
right now.

Automated assembly has become an important strategy in many of the OEM
markets we serve, as companies strive to increase productivity and
reliability. Designing and manufacturing electronic products that meet the
demands of automated assembly are core competencies of Standex Electronics,
which makes reed switches, sensors, miniature coils, magnetic components
and connectors that are found in a wide range of applications. The last
time your windshield washer low fluid light flashed, or the streetlight
outside your house switched on, it was probably triggered by a Standex
sensor or ignitor.

Contrast the tiny components of Standex Electronics with the products of
Standex's Spincraft unit. Home of the world's largest aluminum quenching
furnace and the world's most powerful spin lathes, Spincraft transforms
multi-ton sheets of metal into fuel tank domes for the rockets that carry
communications satellites aloft, a capability that makes Spincraft a major
supplier of high-tech components to the global aerospace industry.

Standex is well positioned to capitalize on the boom in infrastructure
construction now underway in both developed and emerging economies. Our
Custom Hoists unit makes hydraulic telescopic cylinders for dump trucks and
trailers. And think for a moment about the last time a luggage cart brought
your bags up to your hotel room. Chances are it rolled on wheels made by
the Jarvis Caster Group, another Standex unit. With more than 6,000 items
in its product catalogs, Jarvis casters provide mobility to almost anything
that rolls.

Imagine the many ways that Standex touches your home and family life...by
helping you explore, live and pass on your religious values to your
children, shop for the finest specialty food products without leaving your
home, even live more comfortably with quality heating and air conditioning
products. The things we do are an ideal fit with the lifestyle and
aspirations of today's families. Although you'll never see our name on a
religious book, gourmet food or air distribution product, we're there -
adding convenience, saving you time and enhancing the quality of your life.

Our understanding of our market trends makes us a leader in a range of
attractive consumer businesses.

Amidst our society's affluence, many would ask only for more time to spend
at home with family. We are increasingly concerned with how well we invest
our time and energies - how we live our lives and fulfill our most
important values. Virtually all of the companies in the Standex Consumer
Group offer exceptional benefits and advantages to families and individuals
facing these challenges.

For example, your family may welcome the offerings of catalogue companies
as a way to discover new products or purchase favorite products with new
convenience. Through the six catalogue units of Standex Direct, we offer
consumers the ability to place an order for Texas Ruby Red Grapefruit,
Vidalia(R)* onions from Georgia, and some of the Southwest's most appetizing
salsas, in minutes without leaving home. You can shop by phone or by
Internet, whenever you want, 24 hours a day.

Each product individually enjoys a unique and attractive niche in its
marketplace. We aggressively manage the individual mailing lists for the
six product lines to exploit cross-selling opportunities through our direct
mail and telemarketing activities. Furthermore, our integrated fulfillment
and logistics capabilities help us lower our costs and ensure that
perishable items are delivered to you fresh from the farm.

Ownership of the dream home has become a reality for an ever-widening
segment of our society. We also see a growing number of homeowners invest
in their current properties to transform them into ones that offer many
modern day comforts and amenities. If you've recently built or remodeled,
there's an excellent chance that a Standex company manufactured the
products for improving the air quality in your home. Our Standex Air
Distribution unit designs and manufactures products that help keep you warm
in the winter, cool in the summer and breathing fresh air by exchanging the
stale air that accumulates in today's better insulated residences.
Delivering fresh air while conserving energy helps mitigate the risks of
radon and other forms of air pollution in an effective and economical
manner. We operate nine manufacturing facilities across the US to ensure
superior service to national and regional HVAC distributors.

Among the oldest of all our businesses are our Standard Publishing and
Berean(R) Christian Stores units. Propelled by the reemergence of religion in
the US, both units are premier franchises in their respective markets, and
both are a steady and increasing source of cash flow and earnings.

Long the leading publisher of non-denominational religious materials,
Vacation Bible School programs and children's books, Standard Publishing
also publishes magazines with a weekly circulation exceeding 170,000.
Building on strength in traditional media, the unit has become a leader in
new products and packaging designed to appeal to an increasingly youthful,
computer-oriented religious audience. By combining the traditional with the
power of new media, we have developed a range of CD-ROM/book combinations
that are changing the landscape of religious publishing. Standard's
children's bible storybooks consistently appear on the industry's
bestseller list.

Enter a Berean(R) store and you might think you'd walked into one of the
superstores of another major national bookseller. Large and modern, the
stores average over 15,000 square feet - typically much larger than our
competitors and offering a much wider selection. Berean(R) stores also
reflect the latest trends in book and retail merchandising. For example, as
parents' concerns about recent events in public schools drive a greater
interest in home schooling, our stores are either adding or expanding a
home schooling section. Here, the concerned parent can find books,
educational aids and other supporting material for teaching children in the
home. This material focuses both on the ABCs and the Christian values that
our customers have embraced.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Statements contained in the following "Management's Discussion and
Analysis" that are not based on historical facts are "forward-looking
statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of
forward-looking terminology such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe,"
"estimate," "anticipate," "continue," or similar terms or variations of
those terms or the negative of those terms. There are many factors that
affect the Company's business and the results of its operations and may
cause the actual results of operations in future periods to differ
materially from those currently expected or desired. These factors include
uncertainties in competitive pricing pressures, general domestic and
international business and economic conditions and market demand.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, the Company invested $16.8
million in plant and equipment, purchased $7.5 million of the Company's
Common Stock, paid out $9.9 million in cash dividends to the Company's
shareholders and paid down debt by a net amount of $14.9 million. The
Company primarily funded these expenditures with its net operating cash
flows which aggregated $37.1 million.

In June of fiscal year 1998, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of
$12.8 million before taxes. This action was intended to close, dispose of,
or liquidate certain small underperforming and unprofitable operating
plants, product lines and businesses. The charge was recorded in the line
item "Restructuring (credit) charge" on the Statements of Consolidated
Income. This charge and the related reserve activity are discussed in the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 1999, as part
of this restructuring, the Company sold its Christmas Tree Stand product
line in the second quarter, its SXI Technologies division in January 1999
and its Williams Healthcare division in April 1999.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $37.1 million in 1999, an
increase of $4.9 million as compared to $32.2 million in 1998. This
increase was primarily due to $2.5 million expended relative to
restructuring activities in 1999 and other changes in working capital
accounts.

In October, the Company negotiated unsecured loan agreements with two
institutional lenders in the amount of $25 million. The loans have a fixed
interest rate of 6.8% and are repayable in lump-sum payments in October
2008. These unsecured notes are more fully described in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of June 30, 1999, the Company had the ability to borrow an additional
$103.2 million under existing bank credit agreements. The Company believes
that this resource, along with the Company's internally generated funds,
will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash funding needs for the
foreseeable future. The Company's existing bank credit agreements are
described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company's policy of using its funds to make acquisitions when
conditions are favorable, invest in property, plant and equipment, pay
dividends and purchase its Common Stock is expected to continue.

FISCAL 1999 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 1998

Net Sales for the year ended June 30, 1999 increased $25.2 million as
compared to the same period in the prior year. The majority of this
increase came from the added sales of ACME Manufacturing Company (ACME)
which was acquired in October 1997. These added sales were partially offset
by the absence of sales from the Doubleday Bros. product lines that were
disposed of in the prior year. Excluding the acquisition and dispositions,
management believes the majority of fluctuations in Net Sales reported by
each segment are a result of changes in unit volumes and consumer demand.
In addition, although changes in the average foreign exchange rates from
1998 to 1999 had a negative effect on Net Sales in 1999, the total effect
of such changes was not significant.

For the year ended June 30, 1999, the Food Service Segment reported a
slight decrease in Net Sales as compared to the prior year. This decline
was mainly due to the closure of a Nevada operation and sluggish demand in
the beverage dispensing industry. Net Sales in the Industrial Segment were
flat as compared to the same period in the prior year. While most divisions
in the Industrial Segment posted solid increases over last year, the poor
performance of our binding division and the absence of sales from the
disposition of Doubleday Bros. in the second half of fiscal 1998 offset
these gains. The Consumer Segment's Net Sales increased by $26.0 million
when compared to fiscal 1998 due to the acquisition of ACME, as noted
above, and improved demand. Except for a small decline in one unit, all
Consumer divisions experienced improved customer demand.

The Gross Profit Margin Percentage ("GPMP") remained essentially the same
(32.8% vs. 32.5%) for both the current and prior year. The Food Service
Segment reported a GPMP of 31.3%, as compared to the prior year percentage
of 29.7%; this was the result of the disposition of a Nevada operation and
reduced costs at several companies. The GPMP reported in the Industrial
Segment was 31.1%, a small decline from the previous year's percentage of
31.9%. Continued poor performance from the Company's binding division
offset solid positive performances at most of the other Industrial
divisions. The Consumer Segment's GPMP remained relatively unchanged at
35.4% in fiscal 1999 versus 35.6% last year.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SG&A") increased by $3.6
million when compared to the same period in the prior year. The majority of
this increase ($2.9 million) was from the additional SG&A expenses of ACME
and the remainder due primarily to the addition of two Berean Bookstores
during fiscal 1998. None of the remaining fluctuations in SG&A reported by
the Company's three segments were individually significant and corresponded
with the changes in Net Sales discussed above.

A restructuring credit of $1,016,000 was recorded in the second half of
fiscal 1999 and relates to a $12.8 million restructuring charge recorded in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998. This credit is more fully described in
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest Expense increased by 3.5%, or $376,000, when compared to fiscal
1998 as the Company incurred a full year of interest charges on the
increased borrowings related to the ACME acquisition as compared to nine
months in the prior year and moderately higher interest rates.

The above factors resulted in an $18.4 million increase in Income Before
Income Taxes for the year ended June 30, 1999. The effective tax rate in
fiscal 1999 did not vary from what was reported in fiscal 1998 (39.1%); as
a result, Net Income rose $11.2 million or 55.6% when compared to the same
period in the prior year.

FISCAL 1998 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 1997

Net Sales increased by $51.6 million, or 9.1%, for the year ended June 30,
1998 as compared to the fiscal 1997. Substantially all of this increase
came from acquisitions, primarily ACME, and was partially offset by the
absence of sales from businesses disposed of in the prior year. Excluding
these acquisitions, management believes that the majority of fluctuations
in Net Sales reported by each segment are primarily due to changes in unit
volumes and market demand. In addition, although changes in the average
foreign exchange rates from June 30, 1997 to June 30, 1998 also had a
negative impact on Net Sales, the total effect was not significant.

The Consumer Segment reported the largest segment increase in Net Sales of
$46.9 million for the year ended June 30, 1998. Standex Air Distribution
Products Divisions accounted for the majority of this sales growth, as a
result of the ACME acquisition. Also, Berean Christian Stores' Net Sales
increased 10% due to new stores and improved consumer demand.

The Food Service Segment registered a $6.3 million, or 4.2%, rise in Net
Sales for the year ended June 30, 1998 as compared to the prior fiscal
year. Several divisions reported significant gains in Net Sales due to
increased customer demand and the market's acceptance of new products.
However, the full impact of the growth in Net Sales was reduced slightly
due to the absence of sales from the disposition of the Toastswell Company
made in the second half of fiscal 1997.

In the Industrial Segment Net Sales declined by $1.7 million as compared to
the prior year. While increased demand resulted in higher sales at several
divisions, these increases were offset by the absence of sales from the
disposition of Doubleday product lines made in 1997 and continued
sluggishness in some of our European companies.

The GPMP registered a slight decrease in 1998 to 32.5% from 33% in 1997.
The GPMP reported in the Consumer Segment fell to 35.6%, a decline from the
prior year's percentage of 39.0% primarily due to lower initial margins at
ACME. The GPMP reported in the Industrial Segment remained relatively
constant at 31.9% versus 32.1% in 1997. The Food Service Segment reported
an increase in GPMP from 27.9% in 1997 to 29.7% in 1998 as a result of
reduced costs at several divisions.

The SG&A increased by $9.5 million in fiscal 1998 when compared to the
prior year primarily due to the additional SG&A expenses from acquisitions.
Excluding acquisitions, the fluctuations reported in both the Consumer and
Food Service Segments were in direct proportion to their growth in Net
Sales. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in SG&A
reported in the Industrial Segment where dispositions in the second halves
of both fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1997 accounted for most of the decline in
these expenses in this Segment. None of the remaining fluctuations reported
by the Company's three segments were individually significant.

Interest Expense rose by $2.3 million due to increased borrowings to
finance acquisitions and due to higher interest rates.

A restructuring charge of $12.8 million was recorded in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 1998 in connection with the implementation of a restructuring
plan. This plan involves the closing, disposal and liquidation of certain
relatively small under-performing and unprofitable operating plants,
product lines and businesses. This charge is more fully described in the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The above factors resulted in a decline in Income Before Income Taxes of
$10.5 million, or 24.0%. The effective tax rate increased in 1998 to 39.1%
versus 38.1% in 1997 due to several factors, the most significant being the
absence in the fiscal 1998 of certain foreign tax credits. None of the
remaining factors were individually significant.

Due to the above factors, Net Income declined $6.8 million, or 25.1%.

OTHER MATTERS

Inflation - Inflation has not been a significant factor in fiscal 1999,
1998 and 1997 mainly due to fairly stable labor and material costs.

Environmental Matters - The Company is party to various claims and legal
proceedings, generally incidental to its business and has recorded an
appropriate provision for the resolution of such matters. As explained more
fully in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company
does not expect the ultimate disposition of these matters to have a
material adverse effect on its financial statements.

Year 2000 Computer Issues - Under a program started in November 1997, the
Company conducted a review of its computer systems and identified the
programs and applications that were affected by the widely discussed
software problems associated with the Year 2000. As of June 30,1999, the
Company's critical systems have either been appropriately modified and
tested or have been replaced with software that is Year 2000 compliant. The
total cost of modifying all programs, which has been charged to expense
(primarily in fiscal year 1998), was approximately $600,000.

The Company has also communicated with key suppliers, financial
institutions and others with which it and its various operating units do
business, to assure that such third parties are also timely addressing and
rectifying their "Year 2000" issues. However, the Company believes it has
alternate vendors who could provide for the Company's needs if current
vendors are negatively impacted.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

As discussed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
fiscal 1999, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") Nos. 130, 131 and 132, as well as Statement
of Position No. 98-1.

In June 1998, Financial Accounting Standards Board released SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". SFAS No.
133 establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities and will be effective for the Company in
fiscal 2001. Management is currently evaluating the effect of adopting SFAS
No. 133 on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company mitigates certain
of its foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into forward foreign
currency contracts. These contracts are primarily used as a hedge against
anticipated foreign cash flows, such as dividend and loan payments, and are
not used for trading or speculative purposes. The fair value of the forward
foreign currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates, as an adverse change in foreign currency exchange
rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts.
However, any such losses or gains would generally be offset by
corresponding gains and losses respectively, on the related hedged asset or
liability. Due to the absence of forward foreign currency contracts at June
30, 1999, the Company did not have any fair value exposure.

The Company's interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate
changes on its variable rate revolving credit agreement (the "Credit
Agreement"). As of June 30, 1999, a hypothetical 10% immediate increase in
interest rates would increase the Company's annual interest expense by
$387,000. In June 1999, the Company entered into interest rate swap
agreements to fix the interest rate on its short-term borrowings. At June
30, 1999, the fair value of the Company's interest rate swap agreements
would not be materially affected by a 10% adverse change in interest rates.

Approximately $75.0 million of the Company's long-term debt at June 30,
1999 is at fixed interest rates. Accordingly, there would be no immediate
impact on the Company's interest expense associated with its long-term debt
due to fluctuations in market interest rates. However, based on a
hypothetical 10% immediate decrease in market interest rates, the fair
value of the Company's long-term debt, would be increased by approximately
$3.9 million as of June 30, 1999. Such fair value changes may affect the
Company's determination as to whether to retain, replace or retire its long-
term debt.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Summary of Accounting Policies

Basis of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Standex International Corporation and its subsidiaries.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments purchased with
a remaining maturity of three months or less. Such investments are carried
at cost, which approximates fair value, due to the short period of time
until maturity.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market.

Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful
lives using primarily the straight-line method.

Income Taxes
Deferred assets and liabilities are recorded for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements
or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
the differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of
assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates.

Goodwill
The excess of purchase price of acquired companies over the fair value of
net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition has been recorded as
goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a forty-year
period. Accumulated amortization aggregated $10,016,000 and $9,428,000 at
June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The Company annually evaluates the
net balance of goodwill based on the projected operating income of the
respective businesses on an undiscounted cash flow basis.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S.
dollars at year-end exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated
using average exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustment is
reported as a component of comprehensive income in the Statements of
Consolidated Stockholders' Equity. Gains and losses from currency
transactions are included in results of operations.

Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts
Forward foreign currency contracts are used by the Company to protect
certain anticipated foreign cash flows, such as dividends and loan payments
from subsidiaries, against movements in the related exchange rates. The
Company sells the related foreign currency at a fixed price for settlement
on or before the date of the related receipt, and thus protects the dollar
value of the receipt. The Company enters into such contracts for hedging
purposes only. Accordingly, for financial statement purposes, gains or
losses of forward contracts entered into to hedge commitments are deferred
until the position is closed out. At June 30, 1999, the Company had no
significant forward foreign currency contracts.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements
The net differential to be paid or received under the Company's interest
rate swap agreements is accrued as interest rates change and is recognized
over the life of the agreements.

Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company is subject to credit risk through trade receivables and short-
term cash investments. Credit risk with respect to trade receivables is
minimized because of the diversification of the Company's operations, as
well as its large customer base and its geographical dispersion. Short-term
cash investments are placed with high credit-quality financial institutions
or in short-duration, high quality debt securities. The Company limits the
amount of credit exposure in any one institution or type of investment
instrument. The Company is also subject to credit risk exposure relating to
its interest rate swap agreements as described in the debt footnote below.

Accounting Estimates
The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles necessarily
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of
their short-term nature. The carrying amount of the Company's debt
instruments approximates fair value.

Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 1999
financial statement presentation.

New Accounting Pronouncements
In Fiscal 1999, the Company adopted the provisions of Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") Nos. 130, 131, 132 and Statement of
Position ("SOP") No. 98-1 relating to comprehensive income, segment
reporting, pension disclosures and accounting for internal use software
costs, respectively. The effect of adopting SFAS No. 130 resulted in the
reporting of total comprehensive income and its components (net income and
foreign currency translation adjustments) within the Statements of
Consolidated Stockholders' Equity for all periods presented. The adoption
of SFAS Nos. 131 and 132 resulted in modified and/or additional disclosures
in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The
adoption of SOP No. 98-1 had no effect upon adoption.

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board released SFAS No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". SFAS
No.133, as amended, establishes new standards of accounting and reporting
for derivative instruments and hedging activities and will be effective for
the Company in fiscal 2001. Management is currently evaluating the effect
of adopting SFAS No. 133 on the consolidated financial statements.

Bank Credit Agreements
The Company has a revolving credit agreement with eight banks. The
agreement provides for a maximum credit line of $175,000,000 until May
2003, at which time outstanding loans will be due and payable. As of June
30, 1999, the effective rate of interest under the agreement was 6.0%. The
Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.2% on the average daily
unused amount. As of June 30, 1999 and 1998, the Company had no outstanding
borrowings under the agreement.

In addition, the Company has the option to borrow up to $175,000,000 on an
unsecured short-term basis at rates, which are based on LIBOR, varied from
5.25% to 5.83% during 1999. Available borrowings under the revolving credit
agreement described above are reduced by unsecured short-term borrowings.
At June 30, 1999, the Company had the ability to borrow an additional
$103,153,000 under the aforementioned bank credit agreements.

Institutional Investor Agreements
In October 1998, the Company entered into a $25,000,000 note purchase
agreement with two institutional investors. The notes bear interest at 6.8%
annually and are due and payable in October 2008. Additionally, the Company
has a $50,000,000 note purchase agreement which bears interest at 7.13%
annually and is payable in annual installments of $7,143,000 beginning in
September 1999.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements
During 1999, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix
interest rates on a portion of its variable rate debt and to reduce certain
exposures to interest rate fluctuations. At June 30, 1999, the Company had
interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $25.0 million.
Under these agreements, the Company has fixed the effective interest rate
on $25,000,000 at 6.8% for a three-year period. The amounts exchanged are
based on the notional amounts and other terms of the swaps.

Neither the Company nor the counterparties to the agreement, which are
prominent financial institutions, are required to collateralize their
respective obligations under these swaps. The Company is exposed to loss if
one or more of the counterparties defaults. At June 30, 1999, Standex had
no exposure to credit loss on interest rate swaps. The Company does not
believe that any likely change in interest rates would have a material
adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or
cashflows.

Open interest rate contracts are reviewed regularly by the Company to
ensure that they remain effective as hedges of interest rate exposure.
Management believes that the fair value of the rate swap agreements
approximate the recorded amounts.

Loan Covenants and Repayment Schedule
The Company's loan agreements contain limited provisions relating to the
maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on additional
borrowings and investments.

The principal payments due under the institutional investor agreement are
expected to be funded through additional unsecured short-term borrowings.
Such borrowings, and the unsecured short-term borrowings outstanding at
June 30, 1999, may be refinanced by the Company on a long-term basis under
the revolving credit agreement. As such, the short-term outstanding
borrowings, which are not expected to be paid within a year, including
those expected to fund the institutional investor principal payments, are
classified as long-term debt, and the debt repayment schedule as presented
below, is based on the terms of the revolving credit agreement.

Debt is due as follows: 2000, $3,963,000; 2001, $324,000; 2002, $336,000;
2003, $97,163,000; 2004, $7,503,000; and thereafter, $42,785,000.

Commitments
The Company leases certain property and equipment under agreements with
initial terms ranging from one to twenty years. Rental expense for the
years ended June 30, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was approximately $7,900,000;
$7,500,000; and $6,800,000, respectively. At June 30, 1999, the minimum
annual rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases, principally
real estate, were approximately: 2000, $4,600,000; 2001, $3,300,000; 2002,
$2,400,000; 2003, $2,000,000; 2004, $1,700,000; and thereafter, $5,800,000.

Contingencies
The Company is a party to various claims and legal proceedings related to
environmental and other matters generally incidental to its business.
Management has evaluated each matter based, in part, upon the advice of its
independent environmental consultants and in-house counsel and has recorded
an appropriate provision for the resolution of such matters in accordance
with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." Management believes that
such provision is sufficient to cover any future payments, including legal
costs, under such proceedings.

At June 30, 1999, accumulated retained earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries
totaled $26,898,000. No provision for U.S. income and foreign withholding
taxes has been made because it is expected that such earnings will be
reinvested indefinitely or the distribution of any remaining amount would
be principally offset by foreign tax credits. The determination of the
withholding taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these earnings
and the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these
unremitted earnings is not practicable.

Industry Segment Information
The Company is composed of three product groups. These groups are described
on pages 4-15.

Effective July 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information". SFAS No. 131
requires disclosure of segmented information about the Company's operations
based upon how management oversees and evaluates the results of such
operations. Accordingly, the Company has determined that it has three
distinct reportable segments: Food Service, Industrial and Consumer. The
Company considers these three segments reportable as they are managed
separately and the operating results of each segment are regularly reviewed
and evaluated separately by the Company's senior management.

Net sales include only transactions with unaffiliated customers and include
no significant intersegment or export sales. Operating income by segment
and geographic area excludes general corporate and interest expenses.
Assets of the Corporate segment consist primarily of cash, administrative
buildings, equipment, prepaid pension cost, goodwill and other non-current
assets.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair
value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations
in excess of plan assets were $13,555,000, $12,412,000 and $5,802,000,
respectively, as of June 30, 1999 and $9,753,000, $8,521,000 and
$2,330,000, respectively, as of June 30, 1998.

Certain U.S. employees are covered by union-sponsored, collectively
bargained, multi-employer pension plans. Contributions and costs are
determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts
or terms of the plans. Pension expense for these plans was $1,986,000;
$1,726,000 and $1,305,000 in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

Employees' Stock Ownership Plan
The Company has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan covering certain salaried
employees. Amounts provided for this plan are approved by the Board of
Directors and aggregated $1,500,000, $1,200,000 and $1,000,000 for the
years ended June 30, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.

Employee Savings Plan
Effective July 1, 1997, the Company established a 401(k) savings plan
covering substantially all of the Company's full-time domestic employees.
Under the provisions of the plan, employees may contribute a portion of
their compensation within certain limitations. The Company, at the
discretion of the Board of Directors, may make contributions on behalf of
its employees under this plan. Such contributions, if any, become fully
vested immediately. The Company contributions were approximately $871,000
and $466,000, in 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Profit Improvement Participation Share Plan
The Company has maintained a profit improvement incentive plan in which
certain officers and employees participate. The plan is being phased-out
and, consequently, no new units have been awarded since 1995. Units under
this plan were issued at the discretion of the Salary and Employee Benefits
Committee of the Board of Directors and were assigned a value equal to a
multiple of earnings per share payable in five years based upon the net
increase in earnings per share over the five-year period. Each fiscal year,
amounts are charged or credited to operations to reflect this liability.
Amounts charged (credited) to operations for the years ended June 30, 1999,
1998 and 1997 were $286,000, $780,000, and $(259,000) respectively.

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
The Company sponsors unfunded postretirement medical and life plans
covering certain full time employees who retire and have attained the
requisite age and years of service. Retired employees are required to
contribute toward the cost of coverage according to various rules
established by the Company.

The Company records postretirement benefits (such as healthcare and life
insurance benefits) during the years an employee provides services.

The following table sets forth the funded status of the Company's
postretirement benefit plans and accrued postretirement benefit cost

</TABLE>
The assumed weighted average discount rate as of June 30, 1999 and 1998 was
7.25%. The annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of
covered health care benefits is 4.0% for retirees under age 65 in both 1999
and 1998 and is assumed to remain at that level thereafter. A 1% increase
in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have increased the
accumulated benefit obligation by $789,000 and the net postretirement cost
by $56,000 in 1999.

The Company uses the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense
associated with grants of stock options to employees. Had the Company used
the fair value method to measure compensation for grants, net income and
earnings per share would have been as follows:

</TABLE>
<TABLE>
Options granted during 1999, 1998 and 1997 had a weighted average grant
date fair value of $8.87, $8.42 and $7.44, respectively. The fair value of
options on the grant date, including the valuation of the option feature
implicit in the Company's stock purchase plan, was measured using the
Binomial option pricing model. Key assumptions used to apply this pricing
model are as follows:

Year Ended June 30                       1999         1998        1997
<S>                                     <C>          <C>         <C>
Range of risk-free                      4.84%        5.74%       6.49%
  interest rates                        to 5.53%     to 6.4%
Range of expected life of
  option grants (in years)              2 to 7       9           8
Expected volatility of                  29.0%        17.1%       18.5%
  underlying stock                      to 32.2.%    to 23.0%
Range of expected quarterly             $0.19        $0.19       $0.18
  dividends per share                                            to $0.19
</TABLE>
It should be noted that the option pricing model used was designed to value
readily tradable stock options with relatively short lives. The options
granted to employees are not tradable and have contractual lives of up to
ten years. However, management believes that the assumptions used and the
model to value the awards yields a reasonable estimate of the fair value of
the grants made under the circumstances.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows employees to
purchase shares of common stock of the Company at a 15% discount from
market value. Shares of stock reserved for the plan were 266,462 at June
30, 1999. Shares purchased under this plan aggregated 106,506; 71,261; and
85,222; in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

Rights Agreement
The Company has a stock Rights Agreement for which purchase rights have
been distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of
common stock held. The rights may be exercised only if an entity has
acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company's common stock,
or announces an offer to acquire 15% or more of the Company.

Acquisitions And Dispositions
During fiscal 1998, the Company purchased two companies and a product line
for $52,800,000 for cash, stock and a note. In October 1997, the
acquisition of the net assets of ACME Manufacturing Company for cash and a
note was completed. ACME is a manufacturer of heating, ventilation and air
conditioning pipe, duct and fittings for the home building industry. During
the second quarter, the Company purchased a hardware product line, which
included inventory and machinery, of an unrelated company. In March, the
Company acquired ATR Coil Company, Inc. for cash and shares of the
Company's common stock. ATR Coil is a manufacturer of electronic coils and
windings for the industrial, automotive and consumer markets.

During fiscal year 1997, the Company purchased five companies for
$4,800,000 in cash and stock. Acquired were three mail order companies, a
Christian bookstore company, and a publishing company.
<TABLE>
These transactions were accounted for as purchases and, accordingly, the
consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the
acquired businesses from their respective acquisition dates. The purchase
price of the acquisitions was allocated to the assets acquired based on
their respective fair market values and resulted in the recognition of
goodwill of approximately $18,500,00 and $1,500,000 in fiscal year 1998 and
1997, respectively. If the above acquisitions had occurred as of July 1,
1996, the unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations would have
been as follows:

</TABLE>
As part of its restructuring, the Company sold three divisions in fiscal
1999. These transactions are more fully described in the Restructuring
footnote. In February 1998, the Company sold a division for net proceeds of
approximately $2,600,000 and a net loss of $350,000. During fiscal year
1997, the Company sold a division and two product lines for net proceeds of
approximately $5,200,000 and a net gain of approximately $1,035,000.

Restructuring
In June 1998, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $12,758,000
before taxes. This action was intended to close, dispose of, or liquidate
certain small underperforming and unprofitable plants, product lines and
businesses. As part of this restructuring, the Company sold for
approximately $5,100,000 in cash and notes its Christmas Tree Stand product
line in December 1998, its SXI Technologies division in January 1999 and
its Williams Healthcare division in April 1999.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Standex International
Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Standex
International Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1999 and 1998,
and the related statements of consolidated income, stockholders' equity,
and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended June
30, 1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Standex International
Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1999 and 1998, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three
year period ended June 30, 1999 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

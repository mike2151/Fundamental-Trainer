     Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
                     December 31, 2000


Note 1 - Basis of Presentation

   The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to
Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include
all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States for complete financial statements.  In the opinion
of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals and
adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim
financial information have been included.  Operating results for the three and
six months ended December 31, 2000 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2001.  For further
information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes included in the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC).


Note 2 - Business Combinations

   On August 28, 2000, the Company acquired the stock of two companies,
Checkpoint Holdings, Ltd. (Checkpoint) and Flashpoint, Inc. (Flashpoint).
Accordingly, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements include the results of operations and the estimated fair values of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the respective date of
acquisition.

   Checkpoint designates the local currency as their functional currency and
related cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income.  Financial statements of the foreign
subsidiary are remeasured to U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes using
current rates of exchange for monetary assets and liabilities and historical
rates of exchange for nonmonetary assets and related elements of expense.
Revenue and other expense elements are remeasured at rates that approximate the
rates in effect on the transaction dates. Remeasurement gains and losses are
included in the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

   Checkpoint, a private company incorporated in England and Wales, is a
provider of electronic commerce and electronic payment software for the United
Kingdom. The acquisition was completed pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement
dated August 28, 2000 between the Company and Checkpoint stockholders. The
consideration for the acquisition was approximately $60.1 million, consisting of
$4.7 million in cash, $19.8 million in loan notes, 1,013,333 shares of the
Company's common stock, warrants to purchase a total of 100,000 shares of common
stock at an exercise price of $50.00 per share and payment of transaction costs.
In connection with the acquisition, 336,667 shares of the Company's common stock
were issued to satisfy pre-existing loan note obligations of Checkpoint in the
amount of $10.5 million. As a result of the acquisition and the preliminary
allocation of the purchase price, intangible assets of approximately $79.8
million were recorded as identified in the table below.

     Flashpoint, a Massachusetts corporation, is a developer of Web-based
software.  The acquisition was completed pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement
dated August 28, 2000 by and among the Company, Flashpoint, and the sole
stockholder of Flashpoint.  The consideration for the acquisition was
approximately $16.8 million, consisting of $4.5 million in cash, 242,199 shares
of common stock, the assumption of all outstanding stock options of Flashpoint
and payment of transaction costs.  As a result of the acquisition and the
preliminary allocation of the purchase price, intangible assets of approximately
$16.9 million were recorded as identified in the table below.

The intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives, as
follows: customer list, assembled workforce, developed software, trade name and
goodwill - three years; contract backlog - ten months.

     The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting
in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Business
Combinations" ("APB 16"). Under APB 16, purchase price allocations are made to
the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair
values. The value of the Company's common stock was recorded at the average of
the last reported sales price on The Nasdaq National Market during the last
three consecutive trading days ending on and including August 28, 2000. The
value of the warrants and stock options were recorded at their fair values based
on the Black-Scholes valuation method.

     The purchase price allocations are based on preliminary assessments.
Adjustments will be made to the purchase price allocations if changes to the
preliminary assessments occur prior to June 30, 2001. During the quarter ended
December 31, 2000, the Company recorded adjustments to the purchase price in the
amount of approximately $300,000. The effect of the adjustments was to decrease
goodwill from approximately $69.1 million to approximately $68.8 million.

     During fiscal 2000, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets
and assumed certain liabilities of Integrated Cash Management Services, Inc.
(ICM) for an aggregate purchase price of $9.3 million in cash and payment of
transaction costs. Also during fiscal 2000, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding stock of OLC Software, Inc. (OLC) for an aggregate purchase price of
$1.5 million in cash and transaction costs.

     The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the
combined results of operations of the Company, ICM, Checkpoint and Flashpoint as
if the acquisitions had occurred as of the beginning of the six months ended

Note 3 - Short Term Debt

     In connection with the acquisition of Checkpoint, the Company issued
promissory notes with an aggregate value of $20.4 million. The promissory notes,
including accrued interest thereon, mature on August 28, 2001. Prior to the
maturity date, the Company may repay the promissory notes, including accrued
interest, in cash. On the maturity date, at the Company's sole discretion, the
promissory notes, including accrued interest, may be repaid either in cash, the
Company's common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. If all, or a
portion thereof, of the promissory notes are paid in the Company's common stock,
the number of shares to be issued shall be calculated as the amount of
promissory notes to be repaid divided by a fixed stock price of $30.77. The
promissory notes accrue interest at a rate of 10% for the period beginning on
August 28, 2000 and ending on February 28, 2001 and 14% for the period beginning
on February 28, 2001 and ending on August 28, 2001. Since the Company has not
yet determined if the promissory notes will be retired through the payment of
cash, the issuance of common stock, or a combination of cash and common stock,
the promissory notes have been included in current liabilities as the maturity
date is within one year.

     The effect of outstanding stock options and warrants are excluded from the

     The Company is a global designer and developer of financial software
solutions that are sold to businesses and financial institutions. As permitted
by the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131,
"Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information", the
Company has one reportable segment for financial statement purposes.

     At December 31, 2000, long-lived assets of $30.2 million and $74.2 million
were located in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively. At June 30,
2000, all long-lived assets were located in the United States.

Note 7 - Income Taxes

     In the three months ended December 31, 2000, the Company incurred a
substantial operating loss due in large part to the amortization of recently
acquired intangible assets. Since amortization expense will continue to be
incurred over the next three years and the Company has utilized a significant
portion of the income tax loss carryback benefit, the Company determined that a
significant portion of the existing deferred tax assets are less likely, rather
than more likely, to be realized. Accordingly, the Company's deferred tax asset
at December 31, 2000 was $880,000, net of a reserve balance of $12.4 million.

Note 8 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     In December 1999, the SEC published Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB
101"), "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" which provides guidance on
the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial
statements. Effective July 1, 2000, the Company adopted SAB 101. The adoption of
SAB 101 did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial
position for the six months ended December 31, 2000.

     On July 1, 2000, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS Nos.
137 and 138, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities",
which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet
at their fair value. SFAS 133, as amended, did not have a material impact on our
results of operations or financial position.

Results of Operations

Three Months Ended December 31, 2000 Compared To Three Months Ended December
31, 1999

     On August 28, 2000, we acquired the stock of two companies, Checkpoint
Holdings, Ltd. (Checkpoint) and Flashpoint, Inc. (Flashpoint). Both transactions
have been accounted for as purchases. Accordingly, our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements include the results of operations and the
estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the
respective date of acquisition.

     Checkpoint designates the local currency as their functional currency and
related cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. Financial statements of the foreign
subsidiary are remeasured to U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes using
current rates of exchange for monetary assets and liabilities and historical
rates of exchange for nonmonetary assets and related elements of expense.
Revenue and other expense elements are remeasured at rates that approximate the
rates in effect on the transaction dates. Remeasurement gains and losses are
included in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

     Checkpoint, a private company incorporated in England and Wales, is a
provider of electronic commerce and electronic payment software for the United
Kingdom. The acquisition was completed pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement
dated August 28, 2000 between the Company and Checkpoint stockholders. The
consideration for the acquisition was approximately $60.1 million, consisting of
$4.7 million in cash, $19.8 million in loan notes, 1,013,333 shares of the
Company's common stock, warrants to purchase a total of 100,000 shares of common
stock at an exercise price of $50.00 per share and payment of transaction costs.
In connection with the acquisition, 336,667 shares of our common stock were
issued to satisfy pre-existing loan note obligations of Checkpoint in the amount
of $10.5 million. As a result of the acquisition, intangible assets of
approximately $79.8 million, consisting of developed software, trade name,
customer list, assembled workforce, and goodwill were recorded and will be
amortized over a period of three years.

     Flashpoint, a Massachusetts corporation, is a developer of Web-based
software. The acquisition was completed pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement
dated August 28, 2000 by and among the Company, Flashpoint, and the sole
stockholder of Flashpoint. The consideration for the acquisition was
approximately $16.8 million, consisting of $4.5 million in cash, 242,199 shares
of the Company's common stock, the assumption of all outstanding stock options
of Flashpoint and payment of transaction costs. As a result of the acquisition,
intangible assets of approximately $16.9 million, consisting of contract
backlog, assembled workforce, and goodwill were recorded and will be amortized
over a period ranging from ten months to three years.

Revenues

     Total revenues increased by $11.2 million to $22.3 million in the three
months ended December 31, 2000 from $11.1 million in the three months ended
December 31, 1999, an increase of 102%. The increase was primarily attributable
to the iPoint revenue contribution from Checkpoint, in addition to continued
demand for our PayBase, NetTransact and BankQuest products. Revenues, based on
the point of sales, not on the location of the customer, were $14.5 million and
$7.8 million in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively, for the
three months ended December 31, 2000. All revenues for the three months ended
December 31, 1999 were attributable to the United States.

     Software Licenses. Software license fees increased by $4.1 million to $7.6
million in the three months ended December 31, 2000 from $3.5 million in the
three months ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 116%. Software license fees
represented 34% of total revenues in the three months ended December 31, 2000
compared to 32% of total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 1999.
The increase in software license fees was due to the revenue contribution from
Checkpoint, along with continued demand for our PayBase, NetTransact and
BankQuest product offerings. Based on current product plans, we anticipate
software license fees to continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues
during the remainder of the fiscal year.

     Service and Maintenance. Service and maintenance fees increased by $3.9
million to $9.1 million in the three months ended December 31, 2000 from $5.2
million in the three months ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 75%. Service
and maintenance fees represented 41% of total revenues in the three months ended
December 31, 2000 compared to 47% of total revenues in the three months ended
December 31, 1999. The increase in service and maintenance fees was due to the
revenue contribution of Checkpoint, along with several large BankQuest service
contracts. Based on current product plans, we anticipate that service and
maintenance fees will continue to decrease as a percentage of total revenues
during the remainder of the fiscal year.

     Equipment and Supplies. Equipment and supplies sales increased by $3.3
million to $5.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2000 from $2.3
million in the three months ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 139%.
Equipment and supplies sales represented 25% of total revenues in the three
months ended December 31, 2000 compared to 21% of total revenues in the three
months ended December 31, 1999. The increase in equipment and supplies sales is
the result of revenue contribution from Checkpoint. Based on current product
plans, we anticipate that equipment and supplies sales will decrease slightly as
a percentage of total revenues during the remainder of the fiscal year.

Cost of Revenues

     Software Licenses. Software license costs increased by $322,000 to $366,000
in the three months ended December 31, 2000 from $44,000 in the three months
ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 732%. Software license costs were 5% of
software license fees in the three months ended December 31, 2000 compared to 1%
of software license fees in the three months ended December 31, 1999. The
increase in software license costs is attributable to the higher software costs
associated with iPoint product revenue contribution by Checkpoint along with the
10% royalty payable to The Northern Trust Company on NetTransact revenues. We
anticipate software license costs will continue to increase in future quarters
as corresponding iPoint and NetTransact revenues increase.

     Service and Maintenance. Service and maintenance costs increased by $2.4
million to $4.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2000 from $2.3
million in the three months ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 100%.
Service and maintenance costs were 52% of service and maintenance fees in the
three months ended December 31, 2000 compared to 45% of service and maintenance
fees in the three months ended December 31, 1999. Service and maintenance costs
increased due principally to lower historical service and maintenance margins
experienced by Checkpoint. We anticipate that service and maintenance costs will
continue to increase as a percentage of revenues over the remainder of the
fiscal year.

     Equipment and Supplies. Equipment and supplies costs increased by $2.0
million to $3.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2000 from $1.7
million in the three months ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 111%.
Equipment and supplies costs were 66% of equipment and supplies sales in the
three months ended December

                                      10
<PAGE>

31, 2000 compared to 74% of equipment and supplies sales in the three months
ended December 31, 1999. Equipment and supplies costs increased in absolute
dollars primarily due to the corresponding increase in equipment and supplies
sales. Equipment and supplies costs decreased as a percentage of revenue
principally due to higher equipment and supplies margins experienced by
Checkpoint. We anticipate that equipment and supplies costs as a percentage of
revenues will increase slightly during the remainder of the fiscal year.

Operating Expenses

Sales and Marketing:

     Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales
commissions, travel, public relations and marketing materials and trade shows.
Sales and marketing expenses increased by $3.0 million to $6.2 million in the
three months ended December 31, 2000 from $3.2 million in the three months ended
December 31, 1999, an increase of 91%. Sales and marketing expenses were 28% of
total revenues in the three months ended December 31, 2000 compared to 29% of
total revenues in the three months ended December 31, 1999. The dollar increase
was due primarily to additional sales and marketing expenses associated with our
ICM, Checkpoint and Flashpoint acquisitions, the NetTransact product and
increases in staffing and personnel related costs. We anticipate that sales and
marketing expense will not change significantly as a percentage of revenues
during the remainder of the fiscal year.

Product Development and Engineering:

     Product Development and Engineering. Product development and engineering
expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development.
Product development and engineering expenses increased by $1.7 million to $3.6
million in the three months ended December 31, 2000 from $1.9 million in the
three months ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 92%. Product development
and engineering expenses were 16% of total revenues in the three months ended
December 31, 2000, compared to 17% of total revenues in the three months ended
December 31, 1999. The dollar increase was due primarily to additional product
development and engineering expenses associated with our investment in the
NetTransact product and our acquisitions of ICM, Checkpoint and Flashpoint. For
the near future, we believe that product development and engineering costs, as a
percentage of revenues, will increase slightly over the percentage experienced
in the second quarter.

     Acquired in-process research and development. In-process research and
development of $2.6 million represents a non-cash charge related to the ICM
acquisition for in-process research and development during the three months
ended December 31, 1999. The in-process research and development project was
valued using an Income Approach, which included the application of a discounted
future earnings methodology. Using this methodology, the value of the in-process
technology is comprised of the total present value of the future earnings stream
attributable to the technology throughout its anticipated life. No alternative
future uses were identified prior to reaching technological feasibility. There
was no comparable amount for the three months ended December 31, 2000.

     Stock compensation expense. In connection with our acquisition of
Flashpoint, we assumed all of the outstanding common stock options of
Flashpoint, which were exchanged for our common stock options, and recorded
deferred compensation of $1.3 million at the date of acquisition relating to the
intrinsic value of the unvested options. The deferred compensation is being
amortized to expense over the remaining vesting period of the options resulting
in $109,000 of stock compensation expense during the three months ended December
31, 2000. There was no comparable amount for the three months ended December 31,
1999.

General and Administrative:

     General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance
employees and legal and accounting services. General and administrative expenses
increased by approximately $1.6 million to $3.8 million in the three months
ended December 31, 2000 from $2.2 million in the three months ended December 31,
1999, an increase of 77%. General and administrative expenses were 17% of total
revenues in

                                      11
<PAGE>

the three months ended December 31, 2000 compared to 20% of total revenues in
the three months ended December 31, 1999. The dollar increase was due primarily
to additional general and administrative expenses as a result of our
acquisitions of ICM, Checkpoint and Flashpoint. We anticipate that general and
administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenues during the
remainder of the fiscal year.

     Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets
related to our acquisitions increased by $8.2 million to $8.7 million in the
three months ended December 31, 2000 from $482,000 in the three months ended
December 31, 1999. We expect to incur a consistent amount of such amortization
expense during each of the remaining quarters of the fiscal year.

Interest Expense, Net:

     Interest expense, net consists of interest income less interest expense.
Interest expense, net increased by $794,000 to $318,000 in the three months
ended December 31, 2000 from interest income, net of $476,000 in the three
months ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 167%. The increase was due to
interest expense on promissory notes issued in connection with our acquisition
of Checkpoint and due to a reduced cash balance in the current period as a
result of cash used in our acquisitions. We expect interest expense to exceed
interest income during each of the remaining quarters of the fiscal year as a
result of the promissory notes issued in connection with our acquisition of
Checkpoint.

Benefit for Income Taxes:

     The benefit for income taxes was $49,000 in the three months ended December
31, 2000 compared with $1.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 1999.
The benefit as a percentage of the pre-tax loss decreased in the three months
ended December 31, 2000 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 1999
due to the limited amount of loss carryback opportunity available.

     Six Months Ended December 31, 2000 Compared To Six Months Ended December
31, 1999

Revenues

     Total revenues increased by $18.6 million to $38.2 million in the six
months ended December 31, 2000 from $19.6 million in the six months ended
December 31, 1999, an increase of 95%. The increase was primarily attributable
to the iPoint revenue contribution from Checkpoint, in addition to continued
demand for our PayBase, BankQuest, and NetTransact products. Revenues, based on
the point of sales, not on the location of the customer, were $27.2 million and
$11.0 million in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively, for the six
months ended December 31, 2000. All revenues for the six months ended December
31, 1999 were attributable to the United States.

     Software Licenses. Software license fees increased by $8.0 million to $13.3
million in the six months ended December 31, 2000 from $5.3 million in the six
months ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 150%. Software license fees
represented 35% of total revenues in the six months ended December 31, 2000
compared to 27% of total revenues for the six months ended December 31, 1999.
The increase in software license fees was primarily attributable to the revenue
contribution from Checkpoint, along with continued demand for our PayBase,
BankQuest and NetTransact products.

     Service and Maintenance. Service and maintenance fees increased by $6.4
million to $15.9 million in the six months ended December 31, 2000 from $9.5
million in the six months ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 69%. Service
and maintenance fees represented 42% of total revenues in the six months ended
December 31, 2000 compared to 48% of total revenues in the six months ended
December 31, 1999. The dollar increase in service and maintenance fees was due
primarily to the revenue contribution of Checkpoint and several large BankQuest
service contracts.

     Equipment and Supplies. Equipment and supplies sales increased by $4.2
million to $9.0 million in the six months ended December 31, 2000 from $4.8
million in the six months ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 87%. Equipment
and supplies sales represented 23% of total revenues in the six months ended
December 31, 2000 compared to 25% of total revenues in the six months ended
December 31, 1999. The dollar

                                      12
<PAGE>

increase in equipment and supplies sales is the result of revenue contribution
from Checkpoint.

Cost of Revenues

     Software Licenses. Software license costs increased by $497,000 to $587,000
in the six months ended December 31, 2000 from $90,000 in the six months ended
December 31, 1999, an increase of 552%. Software license costs were 4% of
software license fees in the six months ended December 31, 2000 compared to 2%
of software license fees in the six months ended December 31, 1999. The increase
in software license costs is attributable to the higher software costs
associated with iPoint revenue contribution by Checkpoint along with the 10%
royalty payable to The Northern Trust Company on NetTransact revenues.

     Service and Maintenance. Service and maintenance costs increased by $3.7
million to $8.2 million in the six months ended December 31, 2000 from $4.5
million in the six months ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 82%. Service
and maintenance costs were 51% of service and maintenance fees in the six months
ended December 31, 2000 compared to 47% of service and maintenance fees in the
six months ended December 31, 1999. Service and maintenance costs increased
primarily due to the acquisition of Checkpoint.

     Equipment and Supplies. Equipment and supplies costs increased by $2.7
million to $6.3 million in the six months ended December 31, 2000 from $3.6
million in the six months ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 74%. Equipment
and supplies costs were 70% of equipment and supplies sales in the six months
ended December 31, 2000 compared to 75% of equipment and supplies sales in the
six months ended December 31, 1999. Equipment and supplies costs increased in
dollars primarily due to the corresponding increase in equipment and supplies
sales and decreased as a percentage of revenue due to higher equipment and
supplies margins experienced by Checkpoint.

Operating Expenses

Sales and Marketing:

     Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales
commissions, travel, public relations and marketing materials and trade shows.
Sales and marketing expenses increased by $6.2 million to $12.3 million in the
six months ended December 31, 2000 from $6.1 million in the six months ended
December 31, 1999, an increase of 103%. Sales and marketing expenses were 32% of
total revenues in the six months ended December 31, 2000 compared to 31% of
total revenues in the six months ended December 31, 1999. The increase was due
primarily to additional sales and marketing expenses associated with our ICM,
Checkpoint and Flashpoint acquisitions, the NetTransact product and increases in
staffing and personnel related costs.

Product Development and Engineering:

     Product Development and Engineering. Product development and engineering
expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development.
Product development and engineering expenses increased by $3.4 million to $6.5
million in the six months ended December 31, 2000 from $3.1 million in the six
months ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 111%. Product development and
engineering expenses were 17% of total revenues in the six months ended December
31, 2000 compared to 16% of total revenues in the six months ended December 31,
1999. The increase was due primarily to additional product development and
engineering expenses associated with our investment in the NetTransact product
and our acquisitions of ICM, Checkpoint and Flashpoint.

     Acquired in-process research and development. In-process research and
development of $3.9 million represents non-cash charges, related to the
NetTransact and ICM acquisitions for in-process research and development during
the six months ended December 31, 1999. The in-process research and development
projects were valued using an Income Approach, which included the application of
a discounted future earnings methodology. Using this methodology, the value of
the in-process technology is comprised of the total present value of the future
earnings stream attributable to the technology throughout its anticipated life.
No alternative

                                      13
<PAGE>

future uses were identified prior to reaching technological feasibility. There
was no comparable amount for the six months ended December 31, 2000.

     Stock compensation expense. In connection with our acquisition of
Flashpoint, we assumed all of the outstanding common stock options of
Flashpoint, which were exchanged for our common stock options, and recorded
deferred compensation of $1.3 million at the date of acquisition relating to the
intrinsic value of the unvested options. The deferred compensation is being
amortized to expense over the remaining vesting period of the options resulting
in $146,000 of stock compensation expense during the six months ended December
31, 2000. There was no comparable amount for the six months ended December 31,
1999.

General and Administrative:

     General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance
employees and legal and accounting services. General and administrative expenses
increased by approximately $2.1 million to $6.4 million in the six months ended
December 31, 2000 from $4.3 million in the six months ended December 31, 1999,
an increase of 50%. General and administrative expenses were 17% of total
revenues in the six months ended December 31, 2000 compared to 22% of total
revenues in the six months ended December 31, 1999. The dollar increase was due
primarily to additional general and administrative expenses as a result of our
acquisitions of ICM, Checkpoint and Flashpoint and the percentage decrease is
the result of revenues growing faster than general and administrative costs
during the six months ended December 31, 2000.

     Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets
related to our acquisitions increased by $11.4 million to $12.0 million in the
six months ended December 31, 2000 from $607,000 in the six months ended
December 31, 1999.

Interest Expense, Net:

     Interest expense, net consists of interest income less interest expense.
Interest expense, net increased by $1.0 million to interest expense, net of
$54,000 in the six months ended December 31, 2000 from interest income, net of
$957,000 in the six months ended December 31, 1999, an increase of 106%. The
increase was due to interest expense on promissory notes issued in connection
with our acquisition of Checkpoint and due to a reduced cash balance in the
current period as a result of cash used in our acquisitions.

Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes:

     The provision for income taxes was $1.9 million in the six months ended
December 31, 2000 compared with a benefit of $2.2 million in the six months
ended December 31, 1999. In the six months ended December 31, 2000 we incurred a
substantial operating loss due primarily to the amortization of recently
acquired intangible assets. Since amortization expense will continue to be
incurred over the next three years and we have utilized a significant portion of
our income tax loss carryback benefit, we determined that a portion of the
existing deferred tax assets are less likely, rather than more likely, to be
realized. Accordingly, in the current year, we provided a valuation reserve
against such assets that resulted in an income tax provision of $1.9 million. In
the six months ended December 31, 1999, we had sufficient income tax loss
carryback available to benefit a portion of the operating loss.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     We have financed our operations primarily from cash provided by the sale of
our common stock and operating activities. We had negative working capital of
$4.6 million at December 31, 2000, which included cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments totaling $10.3 million.

     The negative working capital position at December 31, 2000 is the result of
$20.4 million of promissory notes issued in connection with the acquisition of
Checkpoint. The promissory notes, including accrued interest, mature on August
28, 2001. Prior to the maturity date, the Company may repay the promissory
notes, including accrued interest, in cash. On the maturity date, at the
Company's sole

                                      14
<PAGE>

discretion, the promissory notes, including accrued interest, may be repaid in
either cash, common stock of the Company or a combination of cash and common
stock. If all, or a portion thereof, of the promissory notes are paid in the
Company's common stock, the number of shares to be issued shall be calculated as
the amount of promissory notes to be repaid divided by a fixed stock price of
$30.77.

     In August 2000, we entered into a ten-year lease for approximately 83,000
square feet of space for a new headquarters facility in Portsmouth, New
Hampshire. Total lease payments for this new facility will be approximately $15
million, which we anticipate will commence in October 2001.

     Cash used in operating activities was $5.2 million in the six months ended
December 31, 2000 and cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 million in
the six months ended December 31, 1999. Net cash used in operating activities,
for the six months ended December 31, 2000, was primarily the result of the net
loss and an increase in accounts receivable, inventory, and prepaid expenses,
along with decreases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred
revenues.

     Net cash used in investing activities was $6.9 million in the six months
ended December 31, 2000 and $13.9 million in the six months ended December 31,
1999. Cash was used in the six months ended December 31, 2000 for the
acquisition of businesses and to acquire property and equipment and equity
investments, offset by proceeds from the sale of short-term investments.

     Net cash used in financing activities was $8.9 million in the six months
ended December 31, 2000 and net cash provided by financing activities was $1.6
million in the six months ended December 31, 1999. Net cash used in financing
activities was the result of the payment of certain liabilities assumed in the
acquisition of Checkpoint, offset by the net proceeds from the exercise of
options pursuant to our stock incentive plans and employee stock purchase plan.

     While we have used approximately $5.2 million in operations during the six
months ended December 31, 2000, we anticipate generating positive cash flow from
operations during the second half of the fiscal year.  Therefore, we believe
that the cash generated from operations, our cash, cash equivalents and short-
term investments on hand and our ability to repay the promissory notes with
common stock will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at
least the next twelve months. We also may receive additional investments from,
and make investments in, customers or other companies.


                 CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

     Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should
carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before purchasing
our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only
ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our
business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business,
financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that case,
the trading price of our common stock could fall, and you may lose all or part
of the money you paid to buy our common stock.

A significant percentage of our revenues to date has come from our payment
management offerings and our performance will depend on continued market
acceptance of these offerings

     A significant percentage of our revenues to date has come from the license
and maintenance of our payment management offerings and sales of related
products and services. Any reduction in demand for our payment management
offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition. Our future performance will depend to a large
degree upon the market acceptance of our payment management offerings as a
payment management solution. Our prospects will also depend upon enterprises
seeking to enhance their payment functions to integrate electronic payment
capabilities. In addition, our future results will depend on the continued
market acceptance of desktop software for use in a departmental setting,
including our laser check printing solutions, as well as our ability to
introduce enhancements to meet the market's evolving needs for secure, payment
management solutions.

                                      15
<PAGE>

Our future financial results will depend upon continued market acceptance of our
NetTransact, BankQuest and iPoint product offerings

     If the NetTransact, BankQuest and iPoint products that we offer as the
result of our acquisitions, do not continue to achieve market acceptance, our
future financial results will be adversely affected. We acquired the NetTransact
bill presentment software from The Northern Trust Company, a financial
institution, in July 1999. General availability of the NetTransact product was
announced in February 2000. We acquired the web-based BankQuest cash management
software in our acquisition of Integrated Cash Management Services, Inc. in
October 1999. BankQuest was commercially introduced in April 2000 and is now
generally available. Checkpoint, which was acquired in August 2000, offers the
iPoint solution, which was introduced to the market in April 2000. If any of
these products has any unanticipated performance problems or bugs, or does not
enjoy wide commercial success, our long-term business strategy would be
adversely affected.

Integration of acquisitions or strategic investments could disrupt our business
and our financial condition could be harmed

     We have made acquisitions of companies, including our recent acquisitions
of Checkpoint and Flashpoint, and we may acquire or make investments in other
businesses, products or technologies in the future. Our acquisitions of
Checkpoint and Flashpoint, as well as any other acquisitions or strategic
investments, if any, may entail numerous risks that include the following:

     .   difficulties in assimilating acquired operations, technologies or
         products;

     .   diversion of management's attention from our core business concerns;

     .   risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior
         experience;

     .   substantial dilution of our current stockholders' ownership;

     .   incurrence of substantial debt;

     .   incurrence of significant amortization expenses related to goodwill and
         other intangible assets; and

     .   incurrence of significant immediate write-offs.

     Any such difficulties encountered as a result of any mergers or acquisition
could materially affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

We face risks associated with our international operations that could harm our
financial condition and results of operations

Our future growth rates and success are in part dependent on continued growth
and success in international markets.  As is the case with most international
operations, the success and profitability of our international operations are
subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that include the following:


     .   difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;

     .   certification requirements and differing regulatory and industry
         standards;

     .   reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;

     .   fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and

     .   import or export licensing requirements.

Our success depends on the wide-spread adoption of the Internet and growth of
electronic business

     Our future success will in large part depend upon the willingness of
businesses and financial institutions to adopt the Internet as a medium of e-
business. These

                                      16
<PAGE>

      entities will probably accept this new medium only if the Internet
provides substantially greater efficiency and enhances their competitiveness.
There are critical issues involved in the commercial use of the Internet that
are not yet fully resolved, including concerns regarding the Internet's:

     .   security;

     .   reliability;

     .   ease of access; and

     .   quality of services.

     To the extent that any of these issues inhibit or limit the adoption of the
Internet as a medium of e-commerce, our business prospects could be adversely
affected. If electronic business does not continue to grow or grows more slowly
than expected, demand for our products and services may be reduced.

Our fixed costs may lead to fluctuations in operating results if our revenues
are below expectations, and if our operating results are below external
expectations, the market price of our common stock may fall

     A significant percentage of our expenses, particularly personnel costs and
rent, are relatively fixed, and based in part on expectations of future
revenues. We may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate
for any significant fluctuations in revenues. Accordingly, shortfalls in
revenues may cause significant fluctuations in operating results in any quarter.
Quarterly operating results that are below the expectations of public market
analysts could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. Factors
that could cause these fluctuations include the following:

     .   the timing of orders and longer sales cycles, particularly due to any
         increase in average selling prices of our software solutions;

     .   the timing and market acceptance of new products or product
         enhancements by either us or our competitors;

     .   the timing of product implementations, which are highly dependent on
         customers' resources and discretion;

     .   the incurrence of costs relating to the integration of software
         products and operations in connection with acquisitions of technologies
         or businesses;

     .   delivery interruptions relating to equipment and supplies purchased
         from third-party vendors, which could delay system sales; and

     .   economic conditions which may affect our customers' and potential
         customers' budgets for technological expenditures.

     Because of these factors, we believe that period to period comparisons of
our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful.

The market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to be
subject to, extreme price and volume fluctuations

     Stock markets, in general, and The Nasdaq Stock Market in particular, have
experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Broad market fluctuations of
this type may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

     The market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to
be subject to extreme fluctuations due to a variety of factors, including:

     .   public announcements concerning us, our competitors or our industry;

     .   fluctuations in operating results;

     .   introductions of new products or services by us or our competitors;

                                       17
<PAGE>

     .   adverse developments in patent or other proprietary rights;

     .   changes in analysts' earnings estimates;

     .   announcements of technological innovations by our competitors; and

     .   general and industry-specific business, economic and market conditions

Our success depends on our ability to develop new and enhanced software,
services and related products

     The bill presentment, payment and cash management software markets in which
we compete are subject to rapid technological change and our success is
dependent on our ability to develop new and enhanced software, services and
related products that meet our evolving market needs. Trends that could have a
critical impact on us include:

     .   rapidly changing technology that could require us to make our products
         compatible with new database or network systems;

     .   evolving industry standards and mandates, such as those mandated by the
         National Automated Clearing House Association, the Association for
         Payment Clearing Services and the Debt Collection Improvement Act of
         1996; and

     .   developments and changes relating to the Internet that we must address
         as we introduce new products.

     If we are unable to develop and introduce new products, or enhancements to
existing products, in a timely and successful manner, our business, operating
results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

We must attract and retain highly skilled personnel with knowledge of electronic
payment and bill presentment technology and the banking industry

     We are dependent upon the ability to attract, hire, train and retain highly
skilled technical, sales and marketing, and support personnel, particularly with
expertise in electronic payment and bill presentment technology and knowledge of
the banking industry. Competition for qualified personnel is intense. In
addition, our corporate headquarters location in Portsmouth, New Hampshire may
limit our access to skilled personnel. Any failure to attract, hire or retain
qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operating results and financial condition. Based on our experience, it takes an
average of nine months for a salesperson to become fully productive. We cannot
assure you that we will be successful in increasing the productivity of our
sales personnel, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect
on our business, operating results and financial condition.

If the Internet infrastructure is not adequately maintained, the demand for our
products and services may decrease

     Our future success will depend, in part, on the maintenance of the Internet
infrastructure. To the extent that the Internet continues to experience
increased numbers of users, frequency of use or increased bandwidth requirements
of users, the Internet infrastructure may not continue to support the demands
placed on it and, as a result, the performance or reliability of the Internet
may be adversely affected. In addition, the Internet could lose its viability as
a form of media due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards
and protocols that can handle increased levels of activity. The infrastructure
and complementary products and services necessary to maintain the Internet as a
viable communications and commercial medium may not be developed or maintained.
Any failure in performance or reliability of the Internet could adversely affect
the demand for our products and services and, consequently, adversely affect our
operating results.

Increased government regulation and legal uncertainties may impair the growth of
the Internet and decrease demand for our products and services

                                       18
<PAGE>

     The laws governing the Internet remain largely unsettled, even in areas
where there has been some legislative action. It may take years to determine
whether and how existing laws, including those governing intellectual property,
privacy, libel and taxation, apply to the Internet generally and to e-commerce
in particular. Legislation could limit the growth in the use of the Internet
generally and decrease the acceptance of the Internet as a communications and
commercial medium, which may decrease demand for our products and services and
thus have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and
financial condition.

Rapid growth could strain our personnel, systems and controls

     In the past, rapid growth has strained our managerial and other resources.
Our ability to manage any future growth will depend in part on our ability to
continue to enhance our operating, financial and management information systems.
We cannot assure you that our personnel, systems and controls will be adequate
to support any future growth. If we are not able to manage growth effectively,
should it occur, the quality of our services, our ability to retain key
personnel and our business, operating results and financial condition could be
materially adversely affected.

Increased competition may result in price reductions and decreased demand for
our products and services

     The market for bill presentment, payment and cash management software is
intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. Growing
competition may result in price reductions of our products and services, reduced
revenues and gross margins and loss of market share, any one of which could have
a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition. Some competitors in our market have longer operating histories,
significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources,
greater brand recognition and a larger installed customer base than we do. In
addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or
establish cooperative relationships to expand their product offerings and to
offer more comprehensive solutions. We also expect to face additional
competition as other established and emerging companies enter the market for
payment management solutions.

Our business can be adversely affected by problems with third-party hardware
that we resell

     Any problems with third-party hardware that we resell could harm our
customer relationships, industry credibility and financial condition. In a prior
fiscal year, we experienced a significant problem with a third-party printer
that we were then reselling which had a material adverse effect on our operating
results. Any repetition of these or similar problems with third party hardware
could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and
financial condition.

We depend on a few key employees who are skilled in e-commerce, payment and bill
presentment methodology and Internet and other technologies

     Our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our executive
officers and key technical employees who are skilled in e-commerce, payment
methodology and regulation, and Internet, database and network technologies. We
currently do not maintain "key man" life insurance policies on any of our
employees. While some of our executive officers have employment agreements with
us, the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key
employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition.

Undetected bugs in our software could adversely affect the performance of our
software and demand for our products

     Our software products could contain errors or "bugs" that we have not been
able to detect which could adversely affect their performance and reduce demand
for our products. Any defects or errors in new products, such as NetTransact,
BankQuest or iPoint, or enhancements could harm our customer relationships and
result in negative publicity regarding us and our products, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition.

Our business could be subject to product liability claims

                                       19
<PAGE>

     Because our software and hardware products are designed to provide critical
payment management, invoicing and cash management functions, we may be subject
to significant product liability claims. Our insurance may not be sufficient to
cover us against these claims or may not be available at all. A product
liability claim brought against us, even if not successful, could require us to
spend significant time and money in litigation. As a result, any such claim,
whether successful or not, could seriously damage our reputation and harm our
business, operating results and financial condition.

Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our
proprietary technology

     We rely upon a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws and non-
disclosure and other intellectual property contractual arrangements to protect
our proprietary rights. However, we cannot assure you that our patents, pending
applications that may be issued in the future, or other intellectual property
will be of sufficient scope and strength to provide meaningful protection of our
technology or any commercial advantage to us, or that the patents will not be
challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We enter into agreements with our
employees and clients that seek to limit and protect the distribution of
proprietary information. We cannot assure you that the steps we have taken to
protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter
misappropriation of proprietary information, and we may not be able to detect
unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property
rights.

We could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights,
which could seriously harm our business

     In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States
involving patents and other intellectual property rights. We may be a party to
litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or as a result of
an alleged infringement of the intellectual property of others. These claims
could require us to spend significant sums in litigation, pay damages, delay
product installments, develop non-infringing intellectual property or acquire
licenses to intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claim.
These claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition.

We may incur significant costs from class action litigation due to the expected
volatility of our common stock

     In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price
of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation. If we
were the object of securities class action litigation, we could incur
substantial costs and experience a diversion of our management's attention and
resources and such securities class action litigation could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

On August 28, 2000, we acquired the stock of Checkpoint, a private company
incorporated in England and Wales and a provider of electronic commerce and
electronic payments software for the United Kingdom.  Checkpoint's functional
currency is the British pound.  As a result, we are exposed to changes in
foreign exchange rates.  When the U.S. dollar strengthens against the British
pound, the value of nonfunctional currency sales decreases.  This exposure may
change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial
results. We currently do not enter into foreign currency hedge transactions.

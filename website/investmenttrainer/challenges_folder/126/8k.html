Item 5. Other Events.

     On October 29, 1999, Ventas, Inc. ("Ventas" or the "Company") entered into
a Waiver and Extension Agreement (the "Waiver Agreement") with over 95 percent
of the lenders under its Credit Agreement (the "Consenting Lenders"). Pursuant
to the Waiver Agreement, Ventas has received a four-month extension of the $275
million bridge loan that was due on October 30, 1999, and a waiver of certain
covenants and events of default under its existing Credit Agreement. However,
two holders of the bridge loan who have not consented to the Waiver Agreement
(representing approximately $20 million, or 7 percent, of the bridge loan
principal) may assert a right to seek repayment of their portion of the bridge
loan currently.

     The waiver period will expire on February 28, 2000, and will terminate
before such date if (i) an event of default under the existing credit facility
that is not expressly waived occurs, is continuing, and is not waived, (ii) the
Chapter 11 case of Vencor, Inc. ("Vencor"), Ventas's primary tenant, becomes a
liquidating Chapter 11 or is converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Code, or
(iii) Ventas fails to comply with any of the covenants contained in the Waiver
Agreement.

     Ventas and the Consenting Lenders have also agreed as soon as practicable,
but in any event by January 31, 2000, to enter into a new agreement relating to
Ventas's indebtedness on the terms and conditions set forth in the term sheet
included as an exhibit to the Waiver Agreement. The term sheet is included as an
exhibit to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. Ventas has
also agreed during the Waiver Period not to pay any dividends or make any
distributions with respect to its equity, not to amend the Rent Stipulation
entered into with Vencor, not to make principal payments to the bridge lenders
who are not Consenting Lenders except to the extent principal payments are made
to the bridge lenders who are Consenting Lenders, and to provide notice of
certain events.

     This Form 8-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"). All statements regarding Ventas's expected future financial
position, results of operations, cash flows, financing plans, business strategy,
expected lease income, plans and objectives of management for future operations
and statements that include words such as "anticipate," "believe," "plan,"
"should," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," and other similar expressions
are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements


                                      -2-

<PAGE>


are inherently uncertain, and stockholders must recognize that actual results
may differ from Ventas's expectations. Ventas does not undertake any duty to
update such forward-looking statements.

     Factors that may affect the plans or results of the Company include,
without limitation, (i) the Company's success in implementing its business
strategy, (ii) the outcome of Vencor's case under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code, (iii) the nature and extent of future competition, (iv) the extent of
future healthcare reform and regulation, including cost containment measures and
changes in reimbursement policies and procedures, (v) increases in cost of
borrowing for the Company, (vi) the ability of the Company's operators to
deliver high-quality care and to attract patients, (vii) the results of the
ongoing investigation of the Company by the U.S. Department of Justice and other
litigation affecting the Company, (viii) the Company's ability to acquire
additional properties, (ix) changes in general economic conditions and/or in the
markets in which the Company may, from time to time, compete, (x) the ability of
the Company to implement the restructuring of its indebtedness in the manner set
forth in the Waiver Agreement, and (xi) the ability of the Company and Vencor
and other third parties to replace, modify or upgrade computer systems in ways
that adequately address the year 2000 issue. Many of such factors are beyond the
control of the Company and its management.

     A copy of the Waiver Agreement and the press release issued by the Company
on November 1, 1999 are included as exhibits to this filing and are incorporated
herein by reference.

                  Section 6.1(e) of the Credit Agreement solely as it relates to
                  the Borrower's failure to pay when due the principal of the
                  Tranche A Loans.

         From and after the Waiver Termination Date, such Events of Defaults, if
any, shall be considered and treated as an Event of Default under the Credit
Agreement, and all rights, privileges and remedies of the Agents and the Lenders
relating thereto under the Credit Agreement and the Loan Documents shall be
fully effective and enforceable as if this Waiver had never been granted.

         The Waivers set forth in this Section 2.2 shall not be binding with
respect to those Tranche A Loans held by Non-Consenting Tranche A Lenders (as
defined herein), if any.

         Section 2.3 Waiver of Certain Defaults under the Pledge Agreement. The
Documentation Agent (on its own behalf and on behalf of the Lenders) hereby
waives, for the Waiver Period only, any "Event of Default" that has occurred and
is continuing under the Pledge Agreement solely as such defined term relates to
a default or Event of Default under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan
Document (as such term is defined in the Pledge Agreement) that is specifically
being waived by this Waiver. Except as set forth below, from and after the
Waiver Termination Date, such Event of Default, if any and if continuing, shall
be considered and treated as an Event of Default under the Pledge Agreement, and
all rights, privileges and remedies of the Documentation Agent relating thereto
under the Pledge Agreement shall be fully effective and enforceable as if this
Waiver had never been granted. Upon the occurrence of a Waiver Termination Date,
the Documentation Agent will not exercise its rights and remedies and no rights
will transfer under the Pledge Agreement for two (2) Business Days.

         Section 3. Borrowings and Payment of Interest. (a) The Borrower hereby
agrees that (i) pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.11(e) of the Credit
Agreement, it is hereby permanently canceling and terminating, as of the
Effective Date, that portion of the remaining Tranche B Commitment under the
Credit Agreement which is in excess of the outstanding principal amount of
Tranche B Loans currently outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and that this
Waiver shall constitute the notice to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and
the Swing Lender which is required under Sections 2.11(e) of the Credit
Agreement and (ii) during the Waiver Period, it will not give any Notice of
Borrowing for Tranche B Loans or Swing Loans, it will not request the issuance
of a Letter of Credit, and the Lenders shall have no obligation to fund any such
Borrowing or to issue any such Letter of Credit.

         (b) During the Waiver Period and at any time thereafter when any
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and notwithstanding
anything in the Credit Agreement to the contrary, the Borrower may not elect any
Interest Period for a Euro-Dollar Loan other than one or three months, and
interest payable pursuant to Section 2.7(c) of the Credit Agreement shall be
payable on the last Business Day of each month, beginning on the Effective Date.

during the Waiver Period:

<PAGE>


                  (i) it will not further amend or modify, in a manner adverse
                  to the Lenders, the Rent Stipulation in any material way
                  except with the prior written consent of the Agents and the
                  Super-Majority Banks;

                  (ii) it will deliver to the Administrative Agent, notice by
                  facsimile, promptly, and in any event within 10 days, if the
                  Rent Stipulation is terminated or if Vencor fails to pay rent
                  to Ventas or the Borrower in accordance with the Rent
                  Stipulation;

                  (iii) it (or Ventas) shall not declare or pay any dividend or
                  make any other distribution of any kind to any holder of
                  Ventas equity; and

                  (iv) it shall not make any payment of principal (or amounts,
                  if any, required pursuant to Section 2.7(e) of the Credit
                  Agreement) to any Tranche A Lender, if any, that is not a
                  party to this Waiver (each a "Non-Consenting Lender");
                  provided, however, that if the Borrower makes any payment of
                  principal (or amounts, if any, required pursuant to Section
                  2.7(e) of the Credit Agreement) to Tranche A Lenders that are
                  parties to this Waiver, then the Borrower shall also be
                  permitted to make such payments to those Tranche A Lenders, if
                  any, that are not parties to this Waiver.

         Section 5. Restructuring Fee. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for the
benefit of each of the Consenting Lenders which have executed and delivered
counterparts of this Waiver by 5:00 p.m. (eastern time) on the Effective Date,
and in consideration of the covenants set forth in Section 15 hereof, an
irrevocable and non-refundable restructuring fee in an aggregate amount equal to
one quarter of one percent (1/4 of 1%) of the sum of the principal aggregate
amount of all Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement; provided, however,
that if all of the Tranche A Lenders shall have executed and delivered
counterparts of this Waiver by 5:00 p.m. (eastern time) on the Effective Date,
then, in lieu of the foregoing, an irrevocable and non-refundable restructuring
fee in an aggregate amount equal to two-fifths of one percent (2/5 of 1%) of the
sum of the principal aggregate amount of all Loans outstanding under the Credit
Agreement shall be payable to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the
Consenting Lenders (the "Restructuring Fee").

         Section 6. Representations and Warranties. The Borrower represents and
warrants to the Agents and the Lenders that:

         (a) the execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of this
Waiver and the performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement as modified
by this Waiver (i) have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action
on the part of the Borrower; and (ii) will not (x) violate (A) any provision of
any statute, rule or regulation or the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws
(or similar governing documents) of the Borrower, (B) any applicable order of
any court or any rule, regulation or order of any other agency of government or
(C) any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which the Borrower is a
party or by which it or any of its property is bound, (y) be in conflict with,
result in a breach of or constitute (with notice or lapse of time or both) a

any of the other Loan Documents executed in connection with the Credit Agreement
in favor of the Agents or the Lenders;

         (b) upon the occurrence of the Effective Date (as hereinafter defined),
this Waiver will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Borrower, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability
thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
equitable principles (regardless of whether the issue of enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);

         (c) after giving effect to this Waiver, no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing (except for the nonpayment to the Tranche A Lenders
not party to this Waiver).

         Section 7. Effective Date. This Waiver shall not become effective until
the date (the "Effective Date") on which this Waiver shall have been executed by
the Borrower, the Agents, Tranche A Lenders holding at least 51% of the
outstanding Tranche A Loans and Lenders representing the Required Banks (as
defined in the Credit Agreement), and the following conditions precedent shall
have been satisfied:

              (i) Receipt by the Agents of fully executed original counterparts
              of this Waiver executed by the Borrower, the Agents, Tranche A
              Lenders representing at least 51% of the outstanding Tranche A
              Loans and Lenders representing the Required Banks, and such Waiver
              shall be accepted and agreed to by Ventas, Inc.

              (ii) The Borrowers shall have paid the Restructuring Fee to the
              Administrative Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available
              funds, for distribution pro rata, based upon the aggregate
              principal amount of all outstanding Loans under the Credit
              Agreement of each such Consenting Lender, to the Consenting
              Lenders which shall have executed and delivered counterparts in
              accordance with Section 5 of this Waiver.

         Section 8. Legal Details. The Agents and their counsel shall have
received all the information, and such counterpart originals or such certified
or other copies of such materials, as the Agents or their counsel may reasonably
request, and all legal matters incident to the effectiveness of this Waiver
shall be satisfactory to the Agents and their counsel. All documents executed or
submitted pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall be satisfactory in
form and substance to the Agents and their counsel.

         Section 9. Miscellaneous Other Provisions. Without limiting the
generality of Section 9.3(a) of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower hereby agrees
that it will pay on presentation (i) all statements for fees and expenses of any
financial, accounting or valuation advisors or special counsel retained by the
Agents (including, but not limited to, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP and Conway,
Del Genio, Gries & Co., LLP), as well as all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the Agents in connection with their duty as Agents and (ii) all reasonable
out-of pocket expenses of members of the steering committee for the Lenders
(other than the Agents), including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
retained by individual members of the steering committee; provided, however,
that the aggregate amount of such out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the
individual steering committee members shall not exceed $150,000. The Borrower
also agrees that its obligations set forth in Section 9.3 of the






                                       5
<PAGE>


Credit Agreement shall extend to the preparation, execution and delivery of this
Waiver, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the
Agents.

         (b) The right of the Borrower pursuant to Section 9.6(c) of
the Credit Agreement to consent to any Assignee and the related assignment shall
be determined without giving effect to this Waiver, and any Assignee and the
related assignment shall always (including any time after expiration of the
Waiver Period) be subject to the consent of the Agents regardless of whether any
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; provided, however, that the
Administrative Agent shall provide written notice to the Borrower of the
identity of any such Assignee which is a new Lender, and the amount of Loans
held by such Assignee, within a reasonable time within which such Assignee
becomes a new Lender.

         Section 10. Lapse of Waiver. The Borrower agrees that its
failure to comply with any provision of this Waiver shall cause the waivers
granted hereby to cease to be in effect immediately and without the requirement
of any prior notice from or further action on the part of any Lender or the
Agents.

         Section 11. Limited Waiver; Ratification of Credit Agreement. (i)
Except to the extent hereby waived or modified, the Credit Agreement and each of
the Loan Documents remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and
affirmed.

         (ii) This Waiver shall be limited precisely as written and shall not be
deemed (a) to be a consent granted pursuant to, or a waiver or modification of,
any other term or condition of the Credit Agreement or any of the instruments or
agreements referred to therein or (b) to prejudice any other right or rights
which the Agents or the Lenders may now have or have in the future under or in
connection with the Credit Agreement or any of the instruments or agreements
referred to therein. Whenever the Credit Agreement is referred to in the Credit
Agreement or any of the instruments, agreements or other documents or papers
executed or delivered in connection therewith, such reference shall be deemed to
mean the Credit Agreement as modified by this Waiver.

         Section 12. Counterparts. This Waiver may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each
of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and
all of which taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Waiver by
facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Waiver.

         Section 13. Loan Document. This Waiver is a Loan Document pursuant to
the Credit Agreement and shall (unless expressly indicated therein) be
construed, administered, and applied in accordance with all of the terms and
provisions of the Credit Agreement.

         Section 14. GOVERNING LAW. THIS WAIVER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD
TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES.

         Section 15. Restructuring. The parties hereby agree that, as soon as
practicable, but by no later than January 31, 2000, the parties shall close a
restructured Credit Agreement (and related





                                       6

documents), to be reasonably agreed upon among the Borrower, the Agents and the
Lenders, which will contain the terms on Exhibit A hereto and which Exhibit A is
made a part hereof (the "Restructuring Proposal"). The parties further agree
that any payments made under Section 5 hereof shall be credited against such
payments due with respect to the "Restructuring Fee" required under the
Restructuring Proposal.

         Section 16. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Waiver shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns.

                    VENTAS REACHES AGREEMENT WITH ITS LENDERS
                         ON LONG-TERM DEBT RESTRUCTURING

LOUISVILLE, KY. (November 1, 1999) - Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) ("Ventas"), the
Louisville-based real estate company, announced today that it has reached an
agreement with over 95 percent of its lenders on terms to restructure all of
Ventas' debt on a long-term basis, including the $275 million bridge loan which
had been due on October 30, 1999.

     "This long-term debt restructuring plan, along with the planned
reorganization of Vencor and our ongoing negotiations with the federal
government, are critical elements in our plan to move Ventas forward," Ventas
CEO Debra A. Cafaro said. "The consummation of the long-term debt restructuring
will permit the Company to pay dividends to our shareholders, and will give the
Company time and flexibility to further improve its capital structure. The plan
is very attractive because of its long-term nature and also because it does not
require us to sell assets, refinance or raise equity in the near term."

     The structure of the new Ventas credit facility, which will replace the
approximately $974 million outstanding under the current credit facility, will
include:

     o   A new $25 million revolving line of credit.

     o   $200 million of Tranche A indebtedness that will be priced at Libor
         plus 275 basis points with a maturity date of December 31, 2002.
         Tranche A will receive approximately $50 million of principal when the
         long-term debt restructuring closes, $50 million within thirty days
         after Vencor's plan of reorganization becomes effective and thereafter
         all excess cash flow from Ventas until $200 million in total has been
         paid down on the debt.

     o   Tranche B consists of $300 million of debt bearing interest at Libor
         plus 375 basis points, maturing on December 31, 2005. It will receive a
         one-time paydown of excess cash held by Ventas within 30 days after the
         Vencor bankruptcy plan becomes effective. Tranche B will also receive
         scheduled paydowns of $50 million in 2003 and $50 million in 2004 with
         the balance due in 2005.

     o   Tranche C consists of approximately $474 million of indebtedness priced
         at Libor plus 425 basis points, with a maturity of December 31, 2007.
         There are no scheduled paydowns.

     o   The entire credit facility is pre-payable without penalty or premium.

Ventas Reaches Agreement With Its Lenders on Long-Term Debt Restructuring

     This new facility will be secured with liens on Ventas' real property
assets. Also, Ventas will pay a one percent restructuring fee of approximately
$10 million, a portion of which (approximately $2.5 million) was paid on October
29 in connection with the extension of the bridge loan. The remainder of the fee
is payable upon closing of the new credit facility. The deal is subject to
customary terms and conditions, including completing documentation of the
transaction by January 31, 2000. While there are no assurances the restructuring
will be completed, management is committed to the successful implementation of
this transaction.

     The agreement provides that Ventas can pay only minimum Real Estate
Investment Trust ("REIT") dividends (equal to 95 percent of its taxable income)
until $200 million of the outstanding debt is paid down. Following that date,
Ventas will have the flexibility to pay dividends at a more normalized level.
Ventas expects to make the required dividend payments for 1999 in 2000, some
time after the long-term restructuring closes. The 1999 dividend may be
satisfied by a combination of cash and a distribution of Vencor equity, which
Ventas expects to receive as part of the Vencor reorganization.

     Under the terms of the waiver and extension agreement, Ventas has received
a four-month extension of the $275 million bridge loan, during which period the
replacement credit facility will be documented, and a waiver of certain
covenants under its existing Credit Agreement. However, two holders of the
bridge loan who have not consented to the waiver and extension (representing
approximately $20 million or 7 percent of the bridge loan principal amount) may
assert a right to seek repayment of their portion of the bridge loan currently.
The waiver and extension will expire on February 28, 2000, and will terminate
before such date if (i) an event of default under the credit facility occurs and
is continuing, and is not waived, (ii) Vencor, Inc.'s case under Chapter 11 of
the United States Bankruptcy Code becomes a liquidating Chapter 11 or is
converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Code, or (iii) Ventas fails to comply
with any covenants in the agreement.

     Ventas' long-term debt restructuring plan follows the mid-September Chapter
11 bankruptcy filing by Vencor, Inc. (OTC: VCRI), Ventas' principal tenant. It
is expected that Vencor will file its reorganization plan and disclosure
statement later this year and Vencor has stated that it expects its
reorganization plan to become effective in the first quarter of 2000. Ventas'
debt restructuring agreement provides that Vencor must emerge from bankruptcy by
December 31, 2000.

     "It is important for Vencor to return to financial well-being so that
Ventas is assured of a dependable revenue stream from its principal tenant,"
Cafaro said. "We believe Vencor's problems have largely been caused by changes
in the government's Medicare payments." Congress currently is considering
possible improvements to the Medicare reimbursement system.

     Ventas, Inc. is a real estate company whose properties include 45
hospitals, 219 nursing centers and eight personal care facilities operating in
36 states. Ventas intends to qualify as a REIT for the year ending December 31,
1999.

     This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"). All statements regarding Ventas' expected future financial
position, results of operations, cash flows, financing plans, business strategy,
expected lease income, plans and objectives of management for future operations
and statements that include words such as "anticipate" "believe," "plan,"
"should," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," and other similar expressions
are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are inherently
uncertain, and stockholders must recognize that actual results may differ from
Ventas' expectations. Ventas does not undertake any duty to update such
forward-looking statements.

     Factors that may affect the plans or results of Ventas include, without
limitation, (1) the treatment of Ventas' claims in Vencor's Chapter 11
proceedings and the ability of Vencor to successfully reorganize under its
Chapter 11 proceedings, (2) the ability of Vencor and Ventas' other operators to
maintain the financial strength and liquidity necessary to satisfy their
obligations and duties under leases and other agreements with Ventas and their
existing credit agreements, (3) the extent of future healthcare reform and
regulation, including cost containment measures and changes in reimbursement
policies and procedures, (4) increases in the cost of borrowing for Ventas, (5)
the ability of Ventas to pay, refinance, restructure and/or extend its
indebtedness as it becomes due, (6) the results of the ongoing settlement
discussions pertaining to the billing disputes and other civil claims against
Ventas and Vencor by the U.S. Department of Justice and other litigation
affecting Ventas, and (7) the success of Ventas in implementing its business
strategy and the nature and extent of future competition. Many of such factors
are beyond the control of Ventas and its management.

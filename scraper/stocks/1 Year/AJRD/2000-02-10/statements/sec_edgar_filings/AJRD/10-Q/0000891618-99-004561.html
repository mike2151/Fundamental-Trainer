                  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
                   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AUGUST 31, 1999

Note A - Basis of Presentation

   The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and therefore do
not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted
accounting principles for complete financial statements. These interim
statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes
thereto included or incorporated by reference in the GenCorp Inc. (Company)
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 1998.

   All normal recurring accruals and adjustments considered necessary for a fair
presentation of the unaudited results for the three and nine month periods ended
August 31, 1999 and 1998, have been reflected. The results of operations for the
nine months ended August 31, 1999, are not necessarily indicative, if
annualized, of those to be expected for the full fiscal year.

   The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   Certain reclassifications have been made to conform prior periods' data to
the current presentation.

Note B - Discontinued Operations

   On December 17, 1998, the Company announced a plan to spin off its
Performance Chemicals and Decorative & Building Products businesses (OMNOVA
Solutions Inc.) to GenCorp shareholders as a separate, publicly traded company.
During the third fiscal quarter of 1999, the Internal Revenue Service issued a
favorable ruling that GenCorp's planned Spin-off would be a tax-free
transaction. Shareholders voted to approve the transaction at a Special
Shareholders' Meeting on September 8, 1999. GenCorp's Board of Directors gave
final approval of the plan on September 17, 1999 and declared a dividend of one
share of OMNOVA Solutions Inc. common stock for each share of GenCorp common
stock held on the September 27, 1999 record date for the dividend. The dividend
distribution was made on October 1, 1999. GenCorp continues to operate Aerojet,
its existing aerospace, defense and fine chemicals segment, and its Vehicle
Sealing segment.

   In conjunction with the Spin-off, the Company adopted a Voluntary Enhanced
Retirement Program (VERP) and Enhanced Involuntary Separation Pay Plan (EISP).
The VERP offers enhanced retirement benefits to eligible salaried employees
within a number of corporate facilities and divisional headquarters. The
majority of the related benefits will be paid from the Company's defined benefit
pension and retiree health care plans. The maximum estimated cost of the VERP
and EISP could range up to $9 million.

   On April 30, 1999, the Company sold its Penn Racquet Sports division (Penn)
to HTM Sports-und Freizeitgerate AG, an Austrian company and HTM USA Holdings
Inc., for aggregate consideration of approximately $42 million. The Company
recognized a pre-tax gain of $16 million on this transaction.

   GenCorp has effectively disposed of its Polymer Products segment, and as a
result of the Spin-off and sale of Penn, GenCorp's financial statements have
been restated to present the results of operations, cash flows and financial
position of the OMNOVA Solutions Inc. business and Penn as discontinued
operations. Discontinued operations also include certain other operations of the
Company's polymer products business which were previously sold and the expenses
related to the Spin-off. Operating results for these discontinued operations
were:

Note D - Comprehensive Income

   On December 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income" (SFAS 130), which
established standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its
components in the financial statements. The adoption of SFAS 130 had no impact
on the Company's net income or shareholders' equity. SFAS 130 requires that
cumulative translation adjustments and minimum pension liability adjustments and
changes thereto be included in other comprehensive income. Reclassifications
have been made in prior period financial statements to conform to the
requirements of SFAS 130.

   The components of total comprehensive income were as follows:

Note E - Other Divestitures

   On June 30, 1998, the Company sold its plastic extrusions appliance gasket
business to ILPEA, Inc. for an aggregate consideration of approximately $3
million.

Note F - Unusual Items

   During the first nine months of fiscal 1998, the Company incurred unusual
items which included charges of $4 million primarily related to exiting the
plastic extrusions appliance gasket business offset by a gain of $13 million
from the sale of surplus land in Nevada by Aerojet.

Note G - Inventories

   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. A portion of the
inventories is priced by use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method using
various dollar value pools. Interim LIFO determinations involve management's
estimates of expected year-end inventory levels. Components of inventory are as

Note I - Long-term Debt and Credit Lines

   On May 10, 1999, the Company paid down and cancelled the $75 million
revolving credit facility used for the purchase of certain assets of Sequa
Chemicals, the specialty chemicals unit of Sequa Corporation.

   The Company had a five-year unsecured $400 million revolving credit facility
(Facility) which was paid off in connection with the Spin-off. As of August 31,
1999, unused and available revolving lines of credit totaled $60 million. The
Company paid a variable commitment fee and interest rates were variable,
primarily based on LIBOR. The Facility contained various debt covenants. As of
August 31, 1999, the Company was required to maintain consolidated net worth of
at least $192 million.

   As of August 31, 1999, the Company had unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit
with several banks for short-term borrowings aggregating $101 million, of which
$52 million was outstanding. In conjunction with the Spin-off, outstanding
unsecured and uncommitted lines of credit were canceled.

   At August 31, 1999, outstanding letters of credit totaled $21 million of
which $2 million was related to discontinued operations.

   In connection with the Spin-off, the Company executed a new five year,
secured, $250 million Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (New Facility) which
expires in 2004. Under the terms of the New Facility, the Company will pay a
variable commitment fee. Interest rates are variable, primarily based on LIBOR,
and the New Facility includes various covenants. On September 29, 1999, the
Company borrowed $125 million under the New Facility.

   Prior to GenCorp's distribution of OMNOVA Solutions Inc. shares, OMNOVA
Solutions Inc. paid a cash dividend of $200 million to GenCorp which amount was
used to repay debt.

Environmental Matters

Sacramento, California

   In 1989, the United States District Court approved a Partial Consent Decree
(Decree) requiring Aerojet to conduct a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study
(RI/FS) of Aerojet's Sacramento, California site and to prepare a RI/FS report
on specific environmental conditions present at the site and alternatives
available to remedy such conditions. Aerojet also is required to pay for certain
governmental oversight costs associated with compliance with the Decree. The
State of California expanded surveillance of perchlorate and
nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) under the RI/FS because these chemicals were
detected in public water supply wells near Aerojet's property at previously
undetectable levels using new testing protocols.

   Aerojet has substantially completed its efforts under the Decree to determine
the nature and extent of contamination at the facility. Preliminarily, Aerojet
has identified the technologies that will likely be used to remediate the site
and estimated costs using generic remedial costs from databases of Superfund



                                      -9-

Note J - Contingencies (continued)

remediation costs. Over the next several years, Aerojet will conduct feasibility
studies to refine technical approaches and costs to remediate the site. The
remediation costs are principally for design, construction, enhancement and
operation of groundwater and soil treatment facilities, ongoing project
management and regulatory oversight, and are expected to be incurred over a
period of approximately 15 years. Aerojet is also addressing groundwater
contamination off of its facility through the development of an Operable Unit
Feasibility Study. This Study is scheduled to be completed and submitted as a
draft to the governmental oversight agencies in December 1999. The Study will
enumerate various remedial alternatives by which offsite groundwater can be
addressed. It will be subject to both governmental agency and public review and
comment before being approved for implementation.

San Gabriel Valley Basin, California

   Aerojet, through its Azusa facility, has been named by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) as a potentially responsible party (PRP) in the portion
of the San Gabriel Valley Superfund Site known as the Baldwin Park Operable Unit
(BPOU). Regulatory action involves requiring site specific investigation,
possible cleanup, issuance of a Record of Decision (ROD) regarding regional
groundwater remediation and issuance to Aerojet and 18 other PRPs Special Notice
letters requiring groundwater remediation.

   All of the Special Notice PRP's are alleged to have contributed volatile
organic compounds (VOC). Aerojet's investigation demonstrated that the
groundwater contamination by VOC is principally upgradient of Aerojet's property
and that lower concentrations of VOC contaminants are present in the soils of
Aerojet's presently and historically owned properties. The EPA contends that
Aerojet is one of the four largest sources of VOC groundwater contamination at
the BPOU of the nineteen PRPs identified by the EPA. Aerojet contests the EPA's
position regarding the source of contamination and the number of responsible
PRPs. Aerojet is participating in a Steering Committee comprised of fourteen of
the PRPs.

   Soon after the EPA issued Special Notice letters in May 1997, as a result of
the development of more sensitive measuring methods, perchlorate was detected in
wells in the BPOU. More recently, NDMA was also detected using newly developed
measuring methods. Suspected sources of perchlorate include Aerojet's solid
rocket development and manufacturing activities in the 1940s and 1950s, and
military ordnance produced by a facility adjacent to the Aerojet facilities in
the 1940s. NDMA is a suspected byproduct of liquid rocket fuel activities by
Aerojet in the same time period. In addition, new regulatory standards for a
chemical known as 1.4 dioxane requires additional treatment. Aerojet may be a
minor contributor of this chemical. Aerojet is in the process of developing new
low cost technologies for the treatment of perchlorate, NDMA and 1.4 dioxane.

   On September 10, 1999, eleven of the nineteen Special Notice PRP's, including
Aerojet, submitted a Good Faith Offer to the EPA to implement an EPA-approved
remedy, which was accepted by the agency as a basis for negotiating an
Administrative Consent Order. The remedy as currently proposed would employ low
cost treatment technologies being developed by Aerojet to treat perchlorate,
NDMA, and 1.4 dioxane, as well as traditional treatment for VOC's. A discussion
of Aerojet's efforts to estimate these costs is contained under the heading
Aerojet's Reserve and Recovery Balances beginning at page 11 of this report and
is incorporated herein by reference.

Muskegon, Michigan

   In a lawsuit filed by the EPA, the United States District Court ruled in 1992
that Aerojet and its two inactive Cordova Chemical subsidiaries (Cordova) are
liable for remediation of Cordova's Muskegon, Michigan site, along with a former
owner/operator of an earlier chemical plant at the site, who is the other
potentially responsible party (PRP). That decision was appealed to the United
States Court of Appeals.



                                      -10-
<PAGE>   11

Note J - Contingencies (continued)

   In May 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued
an en banc decision reversing Aerojet's and the other PRP's liability under the
CERCLA statute. Petitions for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court for
its review of the appellate decision were filed on behalf of the State of
Michigan and the EPA and were granted in December 1997. On June 8, 1998, the
U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion. The Court held that a parent corporation
could be directly liable as an operator under CERCLA if it can be shown that the
parent corporation operated the facility. The Supreme Court vacated the Sixth
Circuit's 1997 ruling and remanded the case back to the U.S. District Court in
Michigan for retrial. Aerojet does not expect that it will be found liable on
remand. Aerojet has been involved in settlement discussions with the EPA and a
proposed consent decree was filed with the District Court in July 1999. If
approved by the District Court, Aerojet and Cordova will be dismissed.

   In a separate action, Aerojet and Cordova won indemnification for the
Muskegon site investigation and remediation costs from the State of Michigan in
the state Court of Claims. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed on appeal, and
the Michigan Supreme Court refused to hear the case. Further, the Michigan
Supreme Court also denied the State's motion for reconsideration. As a result,
the Company believes that most of the $50 million to $100 million in anticipated
remediation costs will be paid by the State of Michigan and the former
owner/operator of the site. A settlement agreement with the State of Michigan,
related to the proposed consent decree discussed above, has been finalized and
will be implemented contingent on the EPA consent decree being approved. In
addition, Aerojet settled with one of its two insurers in August 1999 for $4
million.

Aerojet's Reserve and Recovery Balances

   On January 12, 1999, having finally received all necessary Government
approvals, Aerojet and the U.S. Government implemented, with effect retroactive
to December 1, 1998, the October 1997 Agreement in Principle resolving certain
prior environmental and facility disagreements between the parties. Under this
Agreement, a "global" settlement covering all environmental contamination
(including perchlorate) at the Sacramento and Azusa sites was achieved; the
Government/Aerojet environmental cost sharing ratio was raised to 88 percent/12
percent from the previous 65 percent/35 percent (with both Aerojet and the
Government retaining the right to opt out of this sharing ratio for Azusa only,
after at least $40 million in allowable environmental remediation costs at Azusa
have been recognized); the cost allocation base for these costs was expanded to
include all of Aerojet (in lieu of the prior limitation to the Sacramento
business base); and Aerojet obtained title to all of the remaining Government
facilities on its Sacramento property, together with an advance agreement
recognizing the allowability of certain facility demolition costs.

   During the quarter ended August 31, 1999, Aerojet entered into settlement
agreements covering certain environmental claims with certain of its insurance
carriers. Settlement proceeds of approximately $86.6 million were received in
September 1999. Under the terms of its agreements with the United States
Government, Aerojet is obliged to credit the government a portion of the
insurance recoveries for past costs paid for by the government. The final amount
of such reimbursement, and Aerojet's share of settlement proceeds cannot be
estimated at this time; however, Aerojet believes the matter will be resolved,
or at least become reasonably estimable, before the end of its current fiscal
year.

   Prior to the end of its current fiscal year, Aerojet also believes it will
have a reasonable basis for estimating the costs of addressing groundwater
contamination off its Sacramento facility and its probable share of the San
Gabriel Valley BPOU. Estimates regarding the Sacramento groundwater remediation
will be based on the Sacramento Groundwater Operable Unit Feasibility Study and
Aerojet's opinion as to which remedy will be approved by the EPA. Estimates
regarding the San Gabriel Valley BPOU remediation will be based on the Good
Faith Offer and Administrative Consent Order negotiations discussed above.



                                      -11-
<PAGE>   12

Note J - Contingencies (continued)

   As of August 31, 1999, Aerojet had total reserves of $226 million for costs
to remediate the above sites and has recognized $150 million for probable future
recoveries. These estimates are subject to change as work progresses, additional
experience is gained and environmental standards are revised. In addition, legal
proceedings to obtain reimbursements of environmental costs from insurers are
continuing.

Lawrence, Massachusetts

   The Company has studied remediation alternatives for its closed Lawrence,
Massachusetts facility, which was contaminated with PCBs, and has begun site
remediation and off-site disposal of debris. The Company has a reserve of $16
million for estimated decontamination and long-term operating and maintenance
costs of this site. The reserve represents the Company's best estimate for the
remaining remediation costs. Estimates of future remediation costs could range
as high as $37 million depending on the results of future testing and the
ultimate remediation alternatives undertaken at the site. The time frame for
remediation is currently estimated to range from 5 to 10 years.

Other Sites

   The Company is also currently involved, together with other companies, in 29
other Superfund and non-superfund remediation sites. In many instances, the
Company's liability and proportionate share of costs have not been determined
largely due to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of site conditions and
the Company's involvement. While government agencies frequently claim PRPs are
jointly and severally liable at such sites, in the Company's experience, interim
and final allocations of liability costs are generally made based on relative
contributions of waste. Based on the Company's previous experience, its
allocated share has frequently been minimal, and in many instances, has been
less than 1 percent. The Company has reserves of approximately $15 million as of
August 31, 1999 which it believes are sufficient to cover its best estimate of
its share of the environmental remediation costs at these other sites. Also, the
Company is seeking recovery of its costs from its insurers.

Environmental Summary

   In regard to the sites discussed above, management believes, on the basis of
presently available information, that resolution of these matters will not
materially affect liquidity, capital resources or the consolidated financial
condition of the Company. The effect of resolution of these matters on results
of operations cannot be predicted due to the uncertainty concerning both the
amount and timing of future expenditures and future results of operations.

Other Legal Matters

Olin Corporation

   In August 1991, Olin Corporation (Olin) advised GenCorp that Olin believed
GenCorp to be jointly and severally liable for certain Superfund remediation
costs, estimated by Olin to be $70 million, associated with a former Olin
manufacturing facility and waste disposal sites in Ashtabula County, Ohio. In
1993, GenCorp sought declaratory judgment in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Ohio that the Company is not responsible for
environmental remediation costs. Olin counterclaimed seeking a judgment that
GenCorp is jointly and severally liable for a share of remediation costs. In
late 1995, the Court hearing on the issue of joint and several liability was
completed, and in August 1996 the Court held hearings relative to allocation. At
its request, in 1998, the Court received an additional briefing regarding the
impact of the recent Best Foods Supreme Court decision which the Company
believes definitively addresses many issues in this case in its favor. Another
hearing relative to liability and allocation was held on January 11, 1999. The
Court rendered its interim decision on liability on August 16, 1999, finding
GenCorp 30% liable for remediation costs at "Big D Campground" landfill and 40%
liable for remediation costs attributable to the Olin TDI facility with regard
to the Fieldsbrook site. Subsequent trial phases will address damages,
tentatively scheduled for

Other Legal Matters (continued)

spring 1999. GenCorp has filed a motion for reconsideration on issues of
liability, or alternatively, permission to seek an interim appeal to the Sixth
Circuit.

   The Company continues to vigorously litigate this matter and believes that it
has meritorious defenses to Olin's claims. While there can be no certainty
regarding the outcome of any litigation, in the opinion of management, after
reviewing the information currently available with respect to this matter and
consulting with the Company's counsel, any liability which may ultimately be
incurred will not materially affect the consolidated financial condition of the
Company.

Other Matters

   The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various other legal actions,
governmental investigations, and proceedings relating to a wide range of matters
in addition to those discussed above. In the opinion of management, after
reviewing the information which is currently available with respect to such
matters and consulting with the Company's counsel, any liability which may
ultimately be incurred with respect to these additional matters will not
materially affect the consolidated financial condition of the Company. The
effect of resolution of these matters on results of operations cannot be
predicted because any such effect depends on both future results of operations
and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters.

Note K - Subsequent Events

   Information regarding insurance settlement proceeds is contained at page 11
of this report and is incorporated herein by reference. Information regarding
the Company's New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is contained in Note I --
Long-term Debt and Credit Lines.

Note L - Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

   The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
August 31, 1999 and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of
income for the three and nine month periods ended August 31, 1999 give effect to
the Spin-off and the sale of Penn. The pro forma condensed consolidated balance
sheet is presented as if the Spin-off had occurred on August 31, 1999, and the
pro forma condensed consolidated statements of income are presented as if the
Spin-off and the sale of Penn had occurred as of the beginning of the periods
presented. The "GenCorp Restated" amounts show the effects on reported results
of operations and the balance sheet of GenCorp assuming the Spin-off and the
sale of Penn was consummated. As a result, OMNOVA Solutions Inc. and Penn are
reported as discontinued operations. The "New GenCorp" amounts represent the
estimated effect of the Spin-off on reported results of operations and the
balance sheet of GenCorp including the transfer to OMNOVA Solutions of (1)
prepaid pension assets and retiree benefit obligations; and (2) certain GenCorp
corporate assets and liabilities; and reflects the receipt by GenCorp of a
dividend from OMNOVA Solutions for $200 million and the application of the
amount received by GenCorp to repay indebtedness.

   The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of income do not
include nonrecurring items that are directly attributable to the Spin-off. These
one-time costs are estimated at $13 million after tax and include investment
banking, legal and professional fees, severance costs, retention bonuses for key
employees, financing fees, relocation costs and expenses associated with a
voluntary early retirement program.

   The pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and may
not be indicative of the results that would have been obtained had the Spin-off
actually occurred on the dates assumed nor is it necessarily indicative of the
future consolidated results of operations of GenCorp Inc.

   You should read the pro forma condensed unaudited financial statements in
conjunction with the historical financial statements and the other related notes
thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.

(1) To eliminate the historical assets, liabilities and divisional equity of
OMNOVA Solutions.

(2) To record the transfer of net pension assets and retiree medical obligations
from GenCorp to OMNOVA Solutions. The estimated prepaid pension assets is
attributable to the excess of pension assets over liabilities related to OMNOVA
Solutions employees and retirees. The projected prepaid pension asset of $42
million and retiree medical benefit obligations of $54 million were actuarially
determined based on OMNOVA Solutions active and retired participants in the
plans and the actuarial assumptions used were consistent with assumptions
previously used by GenCorp. The pension assets were split based on the
requirements of Section 414(I) of the Internal Revenue Code as prescribed by the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and other management considerations.

(3) To record the transfer of certain property, plant and equipment, primarily
GenCorp's corporate headquarters, related liabilities and deferred income taxes
to OMNOVA Solutions.

(4) To reflect the impact of one-time costs associated with the Spin-off. These
costs include investment banking, legal and professional fees, severance costs,
retention bonuses for key employees, financing fees, relocation costs and
expenses associated with a voluntary early retirement program.

(5) Reflects the receipt by GenCorp of a dividend from OMNOVA Solutions for $200
million. The amount received by GenCorp was used to repay indebtedness.

(6) To record the effect on GenCorp equity related to the pro forma adjustments
referred to in notes (2), (3), (4) and (5) above.

               NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
                              STATEMENTS OF INCOME
           For The Three and Nine Month Periods Ended August 31, 1999



Footnotes:

(1) The "Discontinued Operations" columns in the unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated statement of income represent the historical results of operations
of the OMNOVA Solutions businesses, the Penn business plus the effects of
certain adjustments, which are reasonable in the opinion of GenCorp's
management, to properly present those results as discontinued operations. The
OMNOVA Solutions and Penn businesses represent the historical Polymer Products
business segment of GenCorp.

(2) To reclassify the historical results of operations of OMNOVA Solutions to
discontinued operations.

(3) To reclassify the historical results of operations of Penn, which was sold
on April 30, 1999, to discontinued operations.

(4) To adjust the historical results of OMNOVA Solutions for the allocated
general corporate expenses that will be retained by GenCorp now that OMNOVA
Solutions is reported as a discontinued operation.

(5) To record the increase in pension expense attributable to the transfer to
OMNOVA Solutions of a portion of the excess of the defined benefit pension
plans' assets over the related obligations for OMNOVA Solutions employees and
retirees.

(6) To transfer corporate costs that will be assumed by OMNOVA Solutions as a
result of the Spin-off. As a result of the Spin-off, these costs will no longer
be incurred by GenCorp. This adjustment also includes the costs associated with
the corporate assets transferred to OMNOVA Solutions from GenCorp.

(7) To adjust interest expense to the amount computed based on the debt retained
by GenCorp after the receipt of a dividend from OMNOVA Solutions for $200
million and the application of the amount received to repay indebtedness. The
interest rate was 5.9 percent for the nine and three periods ended August 31,
1999. The rate was primarily based on LIBOR plus a margin as specified in
GenCorp's credit agreement. A quarter point change in the interest rate would
result in a $.1 million and $.5 million change in interest expense for the three
and nine month periods ended August 31, 1999, respectively.

(8) To record the estimated income taxes related to the pro forma adjustments
referred to in notes (4), (5), (6) and (7) above at an estimated combined U.S.
federal and state income tax rate of 40 percent.

(9) Reflects one-time costs associated with the Spin-off incurred during the
three and nine months ended August 31, 1999. Costs include investment banking,
legal and professional fees, severance costs, retention bonuses for key
employees, relocation costs and expenses associated with a voluntary early
retirement program.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Material Changes in Financial Condition

   Cash flow provided by continuing operating activities for the first nine
periods of fiscal 1999 was $34 million as compared to $(25) million for 1998.
The increase in cash flow provided by continuing operating activities primarily
reflects higher income, increased depreciation, lower working capital
requirements and the timing of certain income tax payments.

   For the first nine months of 1999, $60 million was used in investing
activities including capital expenditures of $61 million. This is compared to
$30 million used for investing activities in the first nine months of 1998,
including capital expenditures of $49 million, offset by proceeds of $19 million
from asset dispositions.

   Financing activities provided $3 million of cash during the nine month period
ended August 31, 1999. This primarily reflects dividend payments of $18 million
and a net increase in total debt of $23 million during this period. Cash flow
provided by financing activities of $221 million in the first nine months of
1998 reflected a $236 million net increase in debt. The net increase in debt was
primarily due to acquisitions made for Polymer Products businesses which are now
reported as discontinued operations.

Material Changes in Results of Operations

   Sales from continuing operations totaled $256 million for the third quarter
of 1999, compared to $284 million during the third quarter of 1998. For the nine
months ended August 31, 1999, sales from continuing businesses increased 8
percent to $816 million as compared to $759 million during the first nine months
of 1998.

   Operating profit from continuing businesses totaled $22 million for the third
quarter of 1999, an improvement of 69 percent versus $13 million for the third
quarter of 1998. For the nine months ended August 31, 1999, operating profit
from continuing businesses increased 46 percent to $70 million as compared to
$48 million during last year's period.

   Corporate and other expenses were favorably impacted by a focused cost
reduction program to prepare for the Spin-off, a reduction in retiree medical
expense and an increase in pension income. Also during the quarter, the Company
incurred costs of $3 million for Spin-off related activities and recorded a tax
provision for certain Spin-off costs that will not be deductible for income tax
purposes.

   Third quarter 1999 earnings from continuing businesses of $0.27 per diluted
share compared to $0.11 per diluted share during the third quarter of 1998. For
the nine month period ending August 31, 1999, earnings from continuing
businesses were $0.83 per diluted share as compared to $0.57 per diluted share
for the same period in 1998, an increase of 46 percent. With discontinued
operations, earnings totaled $0.48 per diluted share during the quarter,
compared to $0.41 per diluted share for the three months ended August 31, 1998.

   During the quarter, the Internal Revenue Service issued a favorable ruling
that GenCorp's Spin-off would be a tax-free transaction. Shareholders voted to
approve the transaction at a Special Shareholders' Meeting on September 8, 1999.
GenCorp's Board of Directors gave final approval of the plan on September 17,
1999 and declared a dividend payable in one share of OMNOVA Solutions Inc.
common stock for each share of GenCorp stock. The Spin-off was completed on
October 1, 1999. After the Spin-off, GenCorp continues to operate Aerojet, its
existing aerospace, defense and fine chemicals segment, and its Vehicle Sealing
segment.

   Due to the completion of the Spin-off, OMNOVA Solutions Inc. will be
reflected on a prospective basis as discontinued operations in the continuing
historical financial statements of GenCorp.

Material Changes in Results of Operations (continued)

Aerospace and Defense

   At Aerojet, net sales were $148.1 million in the third quarter of 1999 as
compared to $205.4 million in the third quarter of 1998. The 1998 period
included sales of a Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) unit and the
final infrared sensor delivery for the Air Force's Defense Support Program
(DSP). Aerojet's operating profit for the third quarter of 1999 was $20.1
million, compared to $19.9 million in the third quarter of 1998. Operating
margins improved during the quarter to 13.6 percent from 9.7 percent in the
third quarter of 1998, due to contract mix and favorable performance award fees.

   Contract awards for the quarter totaled $168 million with contract backlog of
$1.6 billion as of August 31, 1999. Awards for the nine month period ended
August 31, 1999 totaled $468 million, an increase of 24 percent compared to $377
million for the same nine month period of 1998.

   During the third quarter of 1999, the Company announced that it is in
preliminary discussions with another defense company regarding a possible joint
venture with its Aerojet segment's propulsion operations in Sacramento.
Information regarding these discussions is set forth in the Company's Report on
Form 8-K filed with Commission on August 12, 1999 and is incorporated herein by
reference.

Automotive

   Net sales from continuing businesses for the Vehicle Sealing segment improved
41 percent to $108.4 million in the third quarter of 1999, versus $76.9 million
in the third quarter of 1998. The sales gain was due to higher volumes in North
America on the General Motors C/K pickup, Ford Explorer and F-150 platforms. In
addition, the 1998 period was adversely affected by a strike at General Motors.
For the first nine months of 1999, Vehicle Sealing sales increased 33 percent to
$335.5 million versus $252.1 million during the same period in 1998.

   Vehicle Sealing's operating profit totaled $2.2 million in the third quarter
of 1999 as compared to a loss of $(6.4) million for the third quarter of 1998.
Operating profit margins improved to 2.0 percent in the third quarter of 1999
compared to (8.3) percent in the third quarter of 1998, primarily due to the
absence of the General Motors strike and lower product launch costs, partially
offset by operating inefficiencies due to unprecedented levels of customer
vehicle builds and higher scrap rates. For the first nine months of 1999,
operating profit improved to $14.3 million versus $2.8 million for the first
nine months of 1998. Vehicle Sealing's German subsidiary, Henniges, was
profitable for the quarter and the nine months ended August 31, 1999.

Discontinued Operations

Polymer Products

   The OMNOVA and Penn businesses comprised GenCorp's polymer products reporting
segment. The Penn businesses were sold during the second quarter of 1999. The
OMNOVA Solutions businesses were disposed of through the Spin-off on October 1,
1999. Net sales from continuing businesses for the polymer products segment in
the third quarter of 1999 increased 26 percent to $202.9 million compared to
$160.8 million in the third quarter of 1998. Sales increased in both Decorative
& Building Products and Performance Chemicals, primarily from sales attributable
to acquisitions. Operating profit for the polymer products businesses declined
to $21.6 million for the third quarter of 1999 versus $22.5 million in the third
quarter of 1998. Operating margins declined to 10.6 percent in the third quarter
of 1999 compared to 14.0 percent in the third quarter of 1998, due to product
mix in Decorative & Building Products, lower average unit selling prices across
certain Performance Chemicals product lines, higher raw material prices and
increased new product development spending.

Environmental Matters

   GenCorp's policy is to conduct its businesses with due regard for the
preservation and protection of the environment. The Company devotes a
significant amount of resources and management attention to environmental
matters and actively manages its ongoing processes to comply with extensive
environmental laws and regulations. The Company is involved in the remediation
of environmental conditions which resulted from generally accepted manufacturing
and disposal practices in the 1950's and 1960's which were followed at certain
GenCorp plants. In addition, the Company has been designated a potentially
responsible party, with other companies, at sites undergoing investigation and
remediation.

   The nature of environmental investigation and cleanup activities often makes
it difficult to determine the timing and amount of any estimated future costs
that may be required for remedial measures. However, the Company reviews these
matters and accrues for costs associated with the remediation of environmental
pollution when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the liability (usually based upon proportionate sharing) can be
reasonably estimated. The Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
August 31, 1999 reflects accruals of $257 million and amounts recoverable of
$150 million from the U.S. Government and other third parties for such costs.

   The effect of resolution of environmental matters on results of operations
cannot be predicted due to the uncertainty concerning both the amount and timing
of future expenditures and future results of operations. However, management
believes, on the basis of presently available information, that resolution of
these matters will not materially affect liquidity, capital resources or the
consolidated financial condition of the Company. The Company will continue its
efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for
insurance coverage and continued investigation of new and more cost effective
remediation alternatives and associated technologies. For additional discussion
of environmental matters, refer to Note J- Contingencies.

Year 2000

   The Company is currently engaged in a comprehensive project to upgrade its
information, technology, and manufacturing and facilities computer hardware and
software programs to address the Year 2000 issue at its domestic and
international businesses. Many of the Company's systems include new hardware and
updated software packages purchased from established vendors who have
represented that these systems are Year 2000 ready. The Company does not have
large centralized systems, a factor, which the Company believes, reduces the
risk of a single point of failure having widespread impact on the Company.

   As part of this project, the Company has formally communicated with all of
its significant suppliers, vendors and large customers to determine the extent
to which the Company is vulnerable to those parties' failures to correct their
own Year 2000 issues. As of August 31, 1999, the Company has received
approximately 99 percent of the responses, and those responses generally
indicate that these parties will be Year 2000 ready. All third parties with whom
the Company has a material relationship have indicated that they will be Year
2000 compliant.

   The phases of the Year 2000 Compliance project for information technology are
awareness, inventory and assessment, remediation, testing, implementation, and
the last phase of control and monitoring. The Company has completed the
awareness phase and inventory and assessment phase of its information technology
systems. Both internal and external resources are being utilized to test the
Company's software for Year 2000 readiness and, where necessary, the systems are
being remediated through upgrading, replacement, or reprogramming. Also, the
Company has completed an inventory and assessment of its non-information
technology (embedded) systems, prioritizing the impact of each of these systems
on the Company's ability to conduct its operations and, as necessary, obtaining
vendor verification and/or remediation of those systems. The process of
remediating, testing, and implementation will be an iterative process until all
critical systems are Year 2000 ready. The Company believes that approximately 95
percent of its systems were Year 2000 ready as of August 31, 1999 and is in the
control and monitoring phase of the project.



                                      -21-
<PAGE>   22

Year 2000 (continued)

   The estimated cost for this project is projected to range between $1 million
and $2 million, which is being funded through operating cash flows. The Company
has spent approximately $1 million as of August 31, 1999 on this project and
expects to spend the remaining budget by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal
1999.

   Based upon currently available information and considering the Company's
diversified business base, decentralized systems and Year 2000 efforts,
management believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario could
result in minor short-term business interruptions. The Company has prepared
contingency plans which include alternative sourcing to minimize any disruptions
to its businesses resulting from a vendor or supplier not being Year 2000 ready.
However, failure by the Company and/or vendors and customers to complete Year
2000 readiness work in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on
certain of the Company's operations. The Company's exposure could increase or
its timetable for Year 2000 readiness could be delayed as a result of any new
acquisitions.

Adoption of the Euro

   Based upon a preliminary evaluation, management believes that the adoption of
the Euro by the European Economic Community will not have a material impact on
the Company's international businesses. The Company's foreign operations
currently are small and each operation conducts the majority of its business in
a single currency with minimal price variations between countries.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

   The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on
long-term debt obligations. The Company's policy is to manage its interest rate
exposures through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt.
Currently, the Company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage
its interest rate risk. Substantially all of the Company's long-term debt of
$341 million maturing in the year 2001 was variable and had an average variable
interest rate of 5.9 percent as of August 31, 1999. The Company's long-term debt
bears interest at market rates and therefore, the carrying value approximates
fair value.

   Although the Company conducts business in foreign countries, international
operations were not material to the Company's consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows as of August 31, 1999. Additionally, foreign
currency transaction gains and losses were not material to the Company's results
of operations for the nine months ended August 31, 1999. Accordingly, the
Company should not be subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk
with respect to future costs or cash flows from its foreign subsidiaries. To
date, the Company has not entered into any significant foreign currency forward
exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the
effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company
is evaluating the future use of such financial instruments.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

   Information concerning legal proceedings, including proceedings relating to
environmental matters, which appears in Note J beginning on page 9 of this
report is incorporated herein by reference.

PUC Investigation

   Because of the recent "toxic tort" lawsuits which named California water
purveyors as defendants, on March 12, 1998, the PUC announced a wide ranging
investigation of drinking water quality in California. The PUC's General Counsel
has publicly stated that he believes that under the California Constitution, the
PUC's jurisdiction overrides that of the Courts in this area. Accordingly,
Aerojet is also preparing to defend its interests before the PUC. Aerojet's
intervention petition to allow Aerojet to participate in the PUC's proceedings
has been granted. The PUC's investigation is expected to be completed by fall
1999, at which point the stays in the toxic tort cases (as discussed in the
Company's 1998 annual report on Form 10-K) may be lifted.

   On September 1, 1999, the Court of Appeals (1st Appellate District) issued
its opinion in the Santamaria case. The Court approved the PUC's exclusive
jurisdiction over regulated water purveyors but concluded that the toxic tort
cases could proceed against the industrial defendants and non-regulated water
purveyors. Aerojet and the other non-PUC-regulated defendants will seek
reconsideration and review by the California Supreme Court.

In re:  Proposition 65 Notices

   Aerojet was served in February 1999 with a notice from a private party
alleging that it had released chemicals into air and groundwater at or near its
Azusa, California facility above state limits in violation of California's
Proposition 65 and/or without filing sufficiently detailed public notifications
as required by Proposition 65. Following collection and review of all of its
Proposition 65 records, air release reports and groundwater reports, Aerojet
believes it is in compliance with Proposition 65 and will vigorously defend a
Proposition 65 lawsuit if such a lawsuit is initiated.

   Aerojet was served in November and December 1997 with notices from a private
group alleging that it had released chemicals into air and groundwater near its
Sacramento facility above state limits in violation of California's Proposition
65. On June 4, 1998, Aerojet was served with a Proposition 65 lawsuit filed by
the Communities For A Better Environment (CBE) in Sacramento Superior Court. The
complaint alleges past and present violations of Proposition 65. Aerojet's
insurance carriers have been notified on these claims. Aerojet plans a vigorous
defense. On July 6, 1998, the case was removed to U.S. District Court based on
that court's jurisdiction over the CERCLA Partial Consent Decree for the
Sacramento site. Plaintiffs then moved to remand the case to the Sacramento
Superior Court. The remand motion was denied by U.S. District Court in November
1998. On May 12, 1999, the U.S. District Court denied Aerojet's motion for
judgement on the pleadings and remanded the case to State Court. (Communities
for a Better Environment v. Aerojet, No. 98AS02741, Superior Court, Sacramento
County). However, the Court's Order does find that CBE's requested relief would
interfere with Aerojet's ongoing CERCLA activities at the Sacramento facility.
Aerojet will seek dismissal of CBE's claims in State Court.

McKinley, et al. v. GenCorp Inc., et al.

   Following an "investigative" report published in the Houston Chronicle on
November 29, 1998 (which was reprinted by other newspapers and may generate
further media coverage), a "toxic tort" lawsuit was filed against 40 chemical
companies and trade association co-defendants in Common Pleas Court for
Ashtabula County, Ohio, Case No. 98CV00797. The complaint was filed by the heirs
of a former production employee at GenCorp's former polyvinyl chloride ("PVC")
resin facility in Ashtabula, Ohio and GenCorp was served on December 21, 1998.
GenCorp, as the former employer, is alleged to have intentionally exposed the
decedent to vinyl chloride ("VC"), a building block compound for PVC that is
listed as a carcinogen by certain government agencies. The alleged exposure is
claimed to have resulted in fatal liver damage. Plaintiffs also allege that all
of the co-defendants engaged in a conspiracy to suppress information regarding
the carcinogenic risk of VC to industry workers, despite the fact that OSHA has
strictly regulated workplace exposure to VC since 1974. GenCorp has notified its
insurers and will vigorously defend this and any future actions which may be
generated.

   The above lawsuit is apparently an outgrowth of three similar but unrelated
"toxic tort" civil conspiracy cases brought in 14th Judicial District Court,
Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana by the heirs of deceased former employees of two
chemical plants in Lake Charles, Louisiana Ross, et ux. v. Conoco, Inc., et al.
(Case No. 90-4837); Landon, et ux. v. Conoco, Inc., et al. (Case No. 97-7949);
Tousaint, et ux. v. Insurance Co. of North America, et al. (Case No. 92-6172).
GenCorp was named as a "conspiring" co-defendant in all three cases, along with
most of the same co-defendants in the McKinley case.

   On March 22, 1999, GenCorp was served with a similar conspiracy suit alleging
VC exposure from various aerosol products, including hairspray. Bland, et al. v.
Air Products & Chemicals, Inc., et al., Jefferson County (Beaumont), Texas,
(Case No. D-160,599). VC was used as an aerosol propellant in the 1960's. Again,
the same co-defendants are named, with the addition of various consumer products
and personal care manufacturers.

   On or about August 25, 1999, GenCorp was served with a suit alleging
conspiracy, manufacturers' liability, and related claims by a railyard worker
for CSX Transportation in Cincinnati, Ohio. Wiefering, et al. V. Allied Chemical
Corp., et al., Cuyahoga County C.P.CT., (Cleveland) Ohio, (Case No. 389385).
Plaintiff alleges that he contracted "vinyl chloride disease" as a result of
exposure to VC and PVC products shipped by GenCorp and other manufacturers
through the CSX Cincinnati railyards.

   Unlike McKinley, in none of these cases was GenCorp alleged to be an
employer, manufacturer or VC supplier. Nonetheless, GenCorp notified its
insurers and has vigorously defended these actions since served.

   While there can be no certainty regarding the outcome of any litigation, in
the opinion of management, after reviewing the information currently available
with respect to the matters discussed above and consulting with the Company's
counsel, any liability which may ultimately be incurred will not materially
affect the consolidated financial condition of the Company. The effect of
resolution of these matters on results of operations cannot be predicted because
any such effect depends on both future results of operations and the amount and
timing of the resolution of such matter.

   The Company and its subsidiaries are presently engaged in other litigation,
and additional litigation has been threatened. However, based upon information
presently available, none of such other litigation is believed to constitute a
"material pending legal proceeding" within the meaning of Item 103 of Regulation
S-K (17 CFR Reg. 229.103) and the Instructions thereto.

       b) Reports on Form 8-K

          On July 7, 1999, the Company filed an 8-K incorporating its press
          release dated July 7, 1999, announcing that it received an Internal
          Revenue Service ruling that its planned Spin-off will be a tax-free
          transaction. The company also announced its filing of a proxy
          statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, July
          2, 1999.

          On August 11, 1999, the Company filed an 8-K incorporating its press
          release dated August 11, 1999, announcing that third quarter earnings
          were expected to be 10% below current Wall Street consensus estimates.

          On August 12, 1999, the Company filed an 8-K incorporating its press
          release dated August 12, 1999, announcing that it is in preliminary
          discussions with another defense company regarding a possible joint
          venture with its Aerojet segment's propulsion operations in
          Sacramento, California.

Mr. Terry Hall
1644 35th Street NW
Washington, D.C. 20007



Dear Terry:

I am pleased to extend to you this offer of employment with GenCorp Inc. As you
are aware, GenCorp Inc. is in the process of spinning off its Decorative &
Building Products and Performance Chemical divisions into a separately held,
publicly traded company. Prior to the spin-off, you will report to me on special
assignment until the successful spin-off occurs. After the spin-off, you will
report to me as the Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer for GenCorp
Inc. located in Sacramento, California. Your employment will commence on May 1,
1999. This offer is contingent upon your written acceptance of the position
under the following terms of employment:

1.  Your semi-monthly base salary will be $12,916.67, an annualized salary of
    $310,000.

2.  You will be eligible to participate in the company's annual incentive plan,
    beginning with GenCorp's 1999 fiscal year. Your maximum incentive
    opportunity will be 100% of your annual base salary. Your actual incentive
    payment will be based on GenCorp's achievement of specified objectives and
    GenCorp's evaluation of your personal performance. Annual incentive payments
    are payable in January or February following the end of GenCorp's fiscal
    year and in accordance with GenCorp's regular pay practices and discretion
    of the CEO. All annual incentive payments require that you be employed by
    GenCorp on the date of payment.

3.  You will be guaranteed an annual incentive of $232,500 for fiscal year 1999,
    an amount equal to 75% of your starting base salary of $310,000.

4.  You will receive a one-time sign-on bonus of $50,000 to be paid in the first
    regular pay cycle following the date your employment commences ("employment
    date").

5.  On your employment date you will be granted an option to purchase 35,000
    shares of GenCorp common stock pursuant to GenCorp's 1997 Stock Option Plan.
    The option price will be the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange of
    GenCorp common stock on

    your employment date. Also on your employment date, you will be granted
    15,000 restricted shares of GenCorp Common Stock. The restriction will lift
    and the shares will transfer in equal segments of 5,000 shares over a
    three-year period. The first 5,000 shares will transfer one year from your
    employment date. The second and third segments (each equal to 5,000 shares)
    will transfer two years and three years respectively from your employment
    date. Subject to your signature on GenCorp's standard form of Restricted
    Stock Agreement, you will have full voting rights and receive dividends on
    any restricted shares. If your employment terminates for any reason other
    than death, disability, or change in control of GenCorp, you will forfeit
    100% of any shares that are restricted on your termination date. If the
    proposed spin-off is cancelled for any reason, the total amount of
    restricted stock (15,000 shares) will be forfeited.

6.  You will be eligible to participate in the company's long-term incentive
    plan commencing with the beginning of the plan in fiscal year 2000.

7.  You will be eligible to participate in the company's stock option plan. In
    the event the Company grants options to any person in fiscal year 2000, you
    will be entitled to receive an option grant for not less than 30,000 shares
    in fiscal year 2000.

8.  You will automatically participate in the company's retirement plan.
    Participation in this plan does not require employee contributions and your
    accrued benefit fully vests after five years of service.

9.  You will be eligible to participate in the company's retirement savings
    plan. The plan provides a 100% matching contribution up to the first three
    percent of your contributions to the plan and a 50% match on your next three
    percent of contributions. All company-matching contributions vest
    immediately.

10. You will be eligible to participate in the company benefit restoration plan.
    The purpose of this plan is to restore retirement savings plan and pension
    plan benefits that you would otherwise lose because of certain Internal
    Revenue Code limitations on participation in such plans.

11. GenCorp will provide relocation assistance after the successful spin-off
    according to its Relocation Assistance Program for transferring employees.
    You will be guaranteed "no loss of equity" on the sale of your existing
    home, and you shall in addition, be grossed up for any taxes incurred on
    relocation reimbursements that are not otherwise tax deductible on your tax
    returns. To commence the relocation process, please complete the top portion
    of the enclosed Authorization for Movement Form and return it to Sam Harmon
    as soon as possible. After you return the completed form, a representative
    from our third party relocation service provider, Cendant Mobility, will
    contact you to begin your move and to review the details of the program.

12. You will be eligible for individual financial counseling. GenCorp has
    entered into an agreement with AYCO to provide this service. If you elect to
    participate, your cost will be

    10% of the annual fees charged by AYCO. You will incur an income tax
    liability on imputed income resulting from GenCorp's payment of its share of
    AYCO's fees.

13. GenCorp offers a flexible benefits program. It provides a number of benefit
    levels and options from which to choose. These options include:

        -   Comprehensive health insurance

        -   Supplemental group universal life insurance

        -   Accidental death and dismemberment insurance

        -   Short-term disability insurance

        -   Long-term disability insurance

Participation in some of these plans is voluntary and requires employee
contributions. Nothing herein will be deemed to preclude GenCorp from changing
or terminating any employee benefit plan or practice applicable to you and other
employees or require GenCorp to employ you for any specific period of time.

14. The term of your employment will be indefinite in duration and therefore,
    subject to termination at will by notice from you or GenCorp. GenCorp will
    not terminate your employment solely for the purpose of avoiding payment of
    the amount required by paragraph 17 below.

15. GenCorp offers a drug-free work environment. It is the policy of GenCorp
    that all offers of employment are contingent upon successfully passing a
    pre-employment alcohol and drug screen test. Please contact Sam Harmon to
    schedule an appointment at your earliest convenience. Additionally, you must
    satisfy all job-related physical requirements.

16. Lastly, this letter incorporates all of the elements of our employment
    offer, subject to the more definitive terms of the GenCorp Human Resources
    policies and employee benefit plans. There are no other terms or conditions
    of employment, and your acceptance of this offer acknowledges that no one
    provided additional promises or incentives for you to accept this offer.
    Summary descriptions of the GenCorp employee benefit plans are available
    from your human resources representative.

17. If the spin-off described above does not occur your annual salary of
    $310,000 will be continued for one year from the date of termination. Your
    medical health insurance shall also be continued for the one-year period. In
    consideration for any and all lost incentive opportunity at the time of your
    termination, you will also be eligible for 50% of your annual salary at the
    date of termination.

18. GenCorp will provide to you it's standard "Change in Control" Agreement
    after the successful spin off occurs. This agreement will be subject to
    approval by the GenCorp Board of Directors.

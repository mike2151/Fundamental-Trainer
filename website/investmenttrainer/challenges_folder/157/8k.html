                   ---------------
rights to the Designated Holders upon the terms and conditions set forth in this

                   ----------------------
Registrable Securities will cease to be Registrable Securities upon the earlier
of (i) the date a Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities

Registration Statement, (ii) the date the entire amount of the Registrable
Securities owned by a Designated Holder may be sold in a single sale, in the
opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company and such Designated Holder, each
in their reasonable judgment, without any limitation as to volume pursuant to
Rule 144 (or any successor provision then in effect) under the Securities Act or

               3.   Demand Registration.
                    -------------------

               (a) Request for Demand Registration. At any time after January
                   -------------------------------
15, 2003, the General Atlantic Stockholders, acting through GAP LLC or its
written designee, the identity of which shall be certified to the Company in
writing by the General Atlantic Stockholders (the "Initiating Holders"), may
make a written request to the Company to register, and the Company shall
register, under the Securities Act (other than pursuant to a Registration
Statement on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor thereto) (a "Demand
Registration"), the number of Registrable Securities held by such Initiating
Holders stated in such request; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
obligated to effect more than one such Demand Registration for the Initiating
Holders unless less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the requested securities
were included in the previous Demand Registration, in which case the Initiating
Holders shall have the right to require the Company to effect one additional
Demand Registration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
required to effect more than two Demand Registrations. If the Board of
Directors, in its good faith judgment, determines that any registration of
Registrable Securities should not be made or continued because it would
materially interfere with any material financing, acquisition, corporate
reorganization or merger or other material transaction involving the Company (a
"Valid Business Reason"), the Company may (x) postpone filing a Registration
Statement relating to a Demand Registration until such Valid Business Reason no
longer exists, but in no event for more than ninety (90) days, and (y) in case a
Registration Statement has been filed relating to a Demand Registration, the
Company, upon the approval of a majority of the Board of Directors, such
majority to include the General Atlantic Designee, may cause such Registration
Statement to be withdrawn and its effectiveness terminated or may postpone
amending or supplementing such Registration Statement. The Company shall give
written notice of its determination to postpone or withdraw a Registration
Statement

<PAGE>

                                                                               6

and of the fact that the Valid Business Reason for such postponement or
withdrawal no longer exists, in each case, promptly after the occurrence
thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
may not postpone or withdraw a filing under this Section 3(a) more than once in
any twelve (12) month period. Each request for a Demand Registration by the
Initiating Holders shall state the amount of the Registrable Securities proposed
to be sold and the intended method of disposition thereof.

               (b) Incidental or "Piggy-Back" Rights with Respect to a Demand
                   ----------------------------------------------------------
Registration. Each of the Designated Holders (other than Initiating Holders
- ------------
which have requested a registration under Section 3(a)) may offer its or his
Registrable Securities under any Demand Registration pursuant to this Section
3(b). Within five (5) days after the receipt of a request for a Demand
Registration from an Initiating Holder, the Company shall (i) give written
notice thereof to all of the Designated Holders (other than Initiating Holders
which have requested a registration under Section 3(a)) and (ii) subject to
Section 3(e), include in such registration all of the Registrable Securities
held by such Designated Holders from whom the Company has received a written
request for inclusion therein within ten (10) days after the Company gives
notice to such Designated Holders, such written notice referred to in clause (i)
above. Each such request by such Designated Holders shall specify the number of
Registrable Securities proposed to be registered. The failure of any Designated
Holder to respond within such 10-day period referred to in clause (ii) above
shall be deemed to be a waiver of such Designated Holder's rights under this
Section 3 with respect to such Demand Registration. Any Designated Holder may
waive its rights under this Section 3 prior to the expiration of such 10-day
period by giving written notice to the Company, with a copy to the Initiating
Holders. If a Designated Holder sends the Company a written request for
inclusion of part or all of such Designated Holder's Registrable Securities in a
registration, such Designated Holder shall not be entitled to withdraw or revoke
such request without the prior written consent of the Company in its sole
discretion unless, as a result of facts or circumstances arising after the date
on which such request was made relating to the Company or to market conditions,
such Designated Holder reasonably determines that participation in such
registration would have a material adverse effect on such Designated Holder.

               (c) Effective Demand Registration. The Company shall use its
                   -----------------------------
reasonable best efforts to cause any such Demand Registration to become and
remain effective not later than sixty (60) days after it receives a request
under Section 3(a) hereof. A registration shall not constitute a Demand
Registration until it has become effective and remains continuously effective
for the lesser of (i) the period during which all Registrable Securities
registered in the Demand Registration are sold and (ii) 120 days; provided,
however, that a registration shall not constitute a Demand Registration if (x)
after such Demand Registration has become effective, such registration or the
related offer, sale or distribution of Registrable Securities thereunder is
interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of
the Commission or other governmental agency or court for any reason not
attributable to the Initiating Holders and such interference is not thereafter
eliminated or (y) the conditions specified in the underwriting agreement, if
any, entered into in connection with such Demand Registration are not satisfied
or waived, other than by reason of a failure by the Initiating Holder.

               (d) Expenses. The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in
                   --------
connection with a Demand Registration, whether or not such Demand Registration
becomes effective; provided, however, that if a Demand Registration is withdrawn
at the request of the Initiating Holders (other than as a result of information
concerning the business or financial condition of the Company which is made
known to the Initiating Holders after the date on which such Demand Registration
was requested) and if the Initiating Holders elect not to have such registration
count as a Demand Registration, the Initiating Holders and the other Designated
Holders who requested Registrable Securities to be registered on such
registration statement shall pay the Registration Expenses of such registration
pro rata in accordance with the number of their Registrable Securities included
in such registration.

               (e) Underwriting Procedures. If the Company or the Initiating
                   -----------------------
Holders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities held by all of the
Initiating Holders so elect, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause such Demand Registration to be in the form of a firm commitment
underwritten offering and the managing underwriter or underwriters selected for
such offering shall be the Approved Underwriter selected in accordance with
Section 3(f). In connection with any Demand Registration under this Section 3
involving an underwritten offering, none of the Registrable Securities held by
any Designated Holder making a request for inclusion of such Registrable
Securities pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof shall be included in such
underwritten offering unless such Designated Holder accepts the terms of the
offering as agreed upon by the Company, the Initiating Holders and the Approved
Underwriter, and then only in such quantity as will not, in the opinion of the
Approved Underwriter, jeopardize the success of such offering by the Initiating
Holders. If the Approved Underwriter advises the Company that the aggregate
amount of such Registrable Securities requested to be included in such offering
is sufficiently large to have a material adverse effect on the success of such
offering, then the Company shall include in such registration only the aggregate
amount of Registrable Securities that the Approved Underwriter believes may be
sold without any such material adverse effect and shall reduce the amount of
Registrable Securities to be included in such registration, first as to the
Company, second as to the Designated Holders (who are not Initiating Holders and
who requested to participate in such registration pursuant to Section 3(b)
hereof) as a group, if any, and third as to the Initiating Holders as a group,
pro rata within each group based on the number of Registrable Securities owned
by each such Designated Holder or Initiating Holder, as the case may be.

               (f) Selection of Underwriters. If any Demand Registration of
                   -------------------------
Registrable Securities is in the form of an underwritten offering, the Company
shall select and obtain an investment banking firm of national reputation to act
as the managing underwriter of the offering (the "Approved Underwriter");
provided, however, that the Approved Underwriter shall, in any case, also be
approved by the Initiating Holders, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld.

               4.   Incidental or "Piggy-Back" Registration.
                    ---------------------------------------

<PAGE>

                                                                               8

               (a) Request for Incidental Registration. At any time after the
                   -----------------------------------
date hereof, if the Company proposes to file a Registration Statement under the
Securities Act with respect to an offering by the Company for its own account
(other than a Registration Statement on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor
thereto) or for the account of any stockholder of the Company other than the
Designated Holders, then the Company shall give written notice of such proposed
filing to each of the Designated Holders at least twenty (20) days before the
anticipated filing date, and such notice shall describe the proposed
registration and distribution and offer such Designated Holders the opportunity
to register the number of Registrable Securities as each such Designated Holder
may request (an "Incidental Registration"). The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts (within twenty (20) days of the notice provided for in the
preceding sentence) to cause the managing underwriter or underwriters in the
case of a proposed underwritten offering (the "Company Underwriter") to permit
each of the Designated Holders who have requested in writing to participate in
the Incidental Registration to include its or his Registrable Securities in such
offering on the same terms and conditions as the securities of the Company or
the account of such other stockholder, as the case may be, included therein. In
connection with any Incidental Registration under this Section 4(a) involving an
underwritten offering, the Company shall not be required to include any
Registrable Securities in such underwritten offering unless the Designated
Holders thereof accept the terms of the underwritten offering as agreed upon
between the Company, such other stockholders, if any, and the Company
Underwriter, and then only in such quantity as the Company Underwriter believes
will not jeopardize the success of the offering by the Company. If the Company
Underwriter determines that the registration of all or part of the Registrable
Securities which the Designated Holders have requested to be included would
materially adversely affect the success of such offering, then the Company shall
be required to include in such Incidental Registration, to the extent of the
amount that the Company Underwriter believes may be sold without causing such
adverse effect, first, all of the securities to be offered for the account of
the Company; second, the Registrable Securities to be offered for the account of
the Designated Holders pursuant to this Section 4, pro rata based on the number
of Registrable Securities owned by each such Designated Holder; and third, any
other securities requested to be included in such offering.

               (b) Expenses. The Company shall bear all Registration Expenses in
                   --------
connection with any Incidental Registration pursuant to this Section 4, whether
or not such Incidental Registration becomes effective.

               5.   Restrictions on Public Sale by Designated Holders. To the
                    -------------------------------------------------
extent (i) requested (A) by the Company or the Initiating Holders, as the case
may be, in the case of a non-underwritten public offering and (B) by the
Approved Underwriter or the Company Underwriter, as the case may be, in the case
of an underwritten public offering and (ii) all of the Company's officers,
directors and holders in excess of one percent (1%) of its outstanding capital
stock execute agreements identical to those referred to in this Section 5(a),
each Designated Holder agrees (x) not to effect any public sale or distribution
of any Registrable Securities or of any securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for such Registrable Securities, including a sale
pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or offer to sell, contract to
sell (including without

limitation any short sale), grant any option to purchase or enter into any
hedging or similar transaction with the same economic effect as a sale any
Registrable Securities and (y) not to make any request for a Demand Registration
under this Agreement, during the ninety (90) day period or such shorter period,
if any, mutually agreed upon by such Designated Holder and the requesting party
beginning on the effective date of the Registration Statement (except as part of
such registration) for such public offering. No Designated Holder of Registrable
Securities subject to this Section 5(a) shall be released from any obligation
under any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into pursuant to this
Section 5(a) unless all other Designated Holders of Registrable Securities
subject to the same obligation are also released.

                6.      Registration Procedures.
                        -----------------------

                (a) Obligations of the Company. Whenever registration of
                    --------------------------
Registrable Securities has been requested pursuant to Section 3 or Section 4 of
this Agreement, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect the
registration and sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the
intended method of distribution thereof as quickly as practicable, and in
connection with any such request, the Company shall, as expeditiously as
possible:

                                (i)     prepare and file with the Commission a
Registration Statement on any form for which the Company then qualifies or which
counsel for the Company shall deem appropriate and which form shall be available
for the sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended
method of distribution thereof, and cause such Registration Statement to become
effective; provided, however, that (x) before filing a Registration Statement or
           --------  -------
prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, the Company shall provide
counsel selected by the Designated Holders holding a majority of the Registrable
Securities being registered in such registration ("Holders Counsel") and any
                                                   ---------------
other Inspector with an adequate and appropriate opportunity to review and
comment on such Registration Statement and each prospectus included therein (and
each amendment or supplement thereto) to be filed with the Commission, subject
to such documents being under the Company's control, and (y) the Company shall
notify the Holders Counsel and each seller of Registrable Securities of any stop
order issued or threatened by the Commission and take all action required to
prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered;

such amendments and supplements to such Registration Statement and the
prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such
Registration Statement effective for the lesser of (x) 120 days and (y) such
shorter period which will terminate when all Registrable Securities covered by
such Registration Statement have been sold, and comply with the provisions of
the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by
such Registration Statement during such period in accordance with the intended
methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set forth in such Registration
Statement;

                                (iii)   furnish to each seller of Registrable
Securities such number of copies of such Registration Statement, each amendment
and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits thereto), and the
prospectus included in such Registration Statement (including each preliminary
prospectus) and any prospectus filed under Rule 424 under the Securities Act as
each such seller may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition
of the Registrable Securities owned by such seller;

                                (iv)    register or qualify such Registrable
Securities under such other securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions
as any seller of Registrable Securities may request, and to continue such
qualification in effect in such jurisdiction for as long as permissible pursuant
to the laws of such jurisdiction, or for as long as any such seller requests or
until all of such Registrable Securities are sold, whichever is shortest, and do
any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable
to enable any such seller to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of
the Registrable Securities owned by such seller; provided, however, that the
                                                 --------  -------
Company shall not be required to (x) qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this
Section 6(a)(iv), (y) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (z)
consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction;

                                (v)     notify each seller of Registrable
Securities at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be
delivered under the Securities Act, upon discovery that, or upon the happening
of any event as a result of which, the prospectus included in such Registration
Statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading and the Company shall promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to
such prospectus and furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities a
reasonable number of copies of such supplement to or an amendment of such
prospectus as may be necessary so that, after delivery to the purchasers of such
Registrable Securities, such prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading;

                                (vi)    enter into and perform customary
agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form with the
Approved Underwriter or Company Underwriter, if any, selected as provided in
Section 3 or Section 4, as the case may be) and take such other actions as are
prudent and reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the
disposition of such Registrable Securities, including causing its officers to

Approved Underwriter or Company Underwriter;

                                (vii)   make available at reasonable times for

financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the
Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Records") as shall be
                                                 -------
reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence
responsibility, and cause the Company's and its subsidiaries' officers,
directors and employees, and the independent public accountants of the Company,
to supply all information reasonably requested by any such Inspector in
connection with such Registration Statement. Records that the Company
determines, in good faith, to be confidential and which it notifies the
Inspectors are confidential shall not be disclosed by the Inspectors (and the
Inspectors shall confirm their agreement in writing in advance to the Company if
the Company shall so request) unless (x) the disclosure of such Records is
necessary, in the Company's judgment, to avoid or correct a misstatement or
omission in the Registration Statement, (y) the release of such Records is
ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a court of competent
jurisdiction after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom or (z) the information in
such Records was known to the Inspectors on a non-confidential basis prior to
its disclosure by the Company or has been made generally available to the
public. Each seller of Registrable Securities agrees that it shall, upon
learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in a court of competent
jurisdiction, give notice to the Company and allow the Company, at the Company's
expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of the Records
deemed confidential;

underwritten offering, obtain a "cold comfort" letters dated the effective date
of the Registration Statement and the date of the closing under the underwriting
agreement from the Company's independent public accountants in customary form
and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by "cold comfort"
letters as Holders' Counsel or the managing underwriter reasonably requests;

                                (ix)    furnish, at the request of any seller of
Registrable Securities on the date such securities are delivered to the
underwriters for sale pursuant to such registration or, if such securities are
not being sold through underwriters, on the date the Registration Statement with
respect to such securities becomes effective, an opinion, dated such date, of
counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such registration,
addressed to the underwriters, if any, and to the seller making such request,
covering such legal matters with respect to the registration in respect of which
such opinion is being given as the underwriters, if any, and such seller may
reasonably request and are customarily included in such opinions;

                                (x)     comply with all applicable rules and
regulations of the Commission, and make available to its security holders, as
soon as reasonably practicable but no later than fifteen (15) months after the
effective date of the Registration Statement, an earnings statement covering a
period of twelve (12) months beginning after the effective date of the
Registration Statement, in a manner which satisfies the provisions of Section
11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder;

                                (xi)    cause all such Registrable Securities to

necessary to effect the registration of the Registrable Securities contemplated

                (b) Seller Information. The Company may require each seller of
                    ------------------
Registrable Securities as to which any registration is being effected to

regarding the distribution of such securities as the Company may from time to
time reasonably request in writing.

                (c) Notice to Discontinue. Each Designated Holder agrees that,
                    ---------------------
upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the

period from and including the date of the giving of such notice pursuant to
Section 6(a)(v) to and including the date when sellers of such Registrable

Registration Statements filed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, (i) Commission, stock exchange and NASD

(iv) the fees, charges and expenses of counsel to the Company and of its

Stockholders in connection with any Demand Registration, and (v) any liability
insurance or other premiums for insurance obtained by the Company in connection
with any Demand Registration, or Incidental Registration pursuant to the terms

Holders of Registrable Securities sold pursuant to a Registration Statement
shall bear the expense of any broker's commission or underwriter s discount or
commission relating to registration and sale of such Designated Holders'
Registrable Securities and, subject to clause (iv) above, shall bear the fees
and expenses of their own counsel.

                7.      Indemnification; Contribution.
                        -----------------------------

                (a) Indemnification by the Company. The Company agrees to
                    ------------------------------
indemnify and hold harmless each Designated Holder, its partners, directors,
officers, affiliates and each Person who controls (within the meaning of Section
15 of the Securities Act) such Designated Holder from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs of
investigation) (each, a "Liability" and collectively, "Liabilities"), arising
out of or based upon any untrue, or allegedly untrue, statement of a material
fact contained in any Registration Statement, prospectus or preliminary
prospectus or notification or offering circular (as amended or supplemented if
the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or
arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading under the circumstances such statements were made, except
insofar as such Liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission contained in such
Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus or final prospectus in reliance
and in conformity with information concerning such Designated Holder furnished
in writing to the Company by such Designated Holder expressly for use therein,
including, without limitation, the information furnished to the Company pursuant
to Section 7(b). The Company shall also provide customary indemnities to any
underwriters of the Registrable Securities, their officers, directors and
employees and each Person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided above with
respect to the indemnification of the Designated Holders of Registrable
Securities.

                (b) Indemnification by Designated Holders.  In connection with
                    -------------------------------------
any Registration Statement in which a Designated Holder is participating
pursuant to Section 3 or Section 4 hereof, each such Designated Holder shall
promptly furnish to the Company in writing such information with respect to such
Designated Holder as the Company may reasonably request or as may be required by
law for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or prospectus and
all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information
previously furnished to the Company by such Designated Holder not materially
misleading or necessary to cause such Registration Statement not to omit a
material fact with respect to such Designated Holder necessary in order to make
the statements therein not misleading. Each Designated Holder agrees to

<PAGE>

                                                                              14

indemnify and hold harmless the Company, any underwriter retained by the Company
and each Person who controls the Company or such underwriter (within the meaning
of Section 15 of the Securities Act) to the same extent as the foregoing
indemnity from the Company to the Designated Holders, but only if such statement
or alleged statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon
and in conformity with information with respect to such Designated Holder
furnished in writing to the Company by such Designated Holder expressly for use
in such Registration Statement or prospectus, including, without limitation, the
information furnished to the Company pursuant to this Section 7(b); provided,
however, that the total amount to be indemnified by such Designated Holder
pursuant to this Section 7(b) shall be limited to the net proceeds (after
deducting the underwriters' discounts and commissions) received by such
Designated Holder in the offering to which the Registration Statement or
prospectus relates.

               (c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Any Person entitled
                   --------------------------------------
to indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party (the "Indemnifying Party") after the
receipt by the Indemnified Party of any written notice of the commencement of
any action, suit, proceeding or investigation or threat thereof made in writing
for which the Indemnified Party intends to claim indemnification or contribution
pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that the failure so to notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability
that it may have to the Indemnified Party hereunder (except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced or otherwise forfeits
substantive rights or defenses by reason of such failure). If notice of
commencement of any such action is given to the Indemnifying Party as above
provided, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the
extent it may wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Party similarly
notified, to assume the defense of such action at its own expense, with counsel
chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such
action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party
agrees to pay the same, (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense
of such action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party or
(iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties)
include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and such parties
have been advised by such counsel that either (x) representation of such
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be
inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct or (y) there
may be one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are
different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party. In
any of such cases, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the
defense of such action on behalf of such Indemnified Party, it being understood,
however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the fees and
expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local
counsel) for all Indemnified Parties. No Indemnifying Party shall be liable for
any settlement entered into without its written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the consent of
such Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened
proceeding in respect of which such Indemnified Party is a party and

<PAGE>

                                                                              15

indemnity has been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such
settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability for claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

               (d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this
                   ------------
Section 8 from the Indemnifying Party is due but unavailable to an Indemnified
Party hereunder in respect of any Liabilities referred to herein, then the
Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result
of such Liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the
actions which resulted in such Liabilities, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative faults of such Indemnifying Party and
Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has
been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or
Indemnified Party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid
or payable by a party as a result of the Liabilities referred to above shall be
deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 7(a), 7(b)
and 7(c), any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by
such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding; provided that the
total amount to be contributed by such Designated Holder shall be limited to the
net proceeds (after deducting the underwriters' discounts and commissions)
received by such Designated Holder in the offering.

               The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this Section 7(d) were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

               8. Rule 144. The Company covenants that it shall (a) file any
                  --------
reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act and (b) take such
further action as each Designated Holder may reasonably request (including
providing any information necessary to comply with Rule 144 under the Securities
Act), all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Designated
Holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities
Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or Regulation S
under the Securities Act or (ii) any similar rules or regulations hereafter
adopted by the Commission. The Company shall, upon the request of any Designated
Holder, deliver to such Designated Holder a written statement as to whether it
has complied with such requirements.

               9. Miscellaneous.
                  -------------

<PAGE>

                                                                              16

               (a) Recapitalizations, Exchanges, etc. The Company shall cause
                   ---------------------------------
any successor or assign (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or
otherwise) to enter into a new registration rights agreement with the Designated
Holders on terms substantially the same as this Agreement as a condition of any
such transaction.

               (b) No Inconsistent Agreements. Except as set forth on Schedule
                   --------------------------
9(b), the Company represents and warrants that it has not granted to any Person
the right to now or in the future request or require the Company to register any
securities issued by the Company, other than the rights granted to the
Designated Holders herein. The Company shall not enter into any agreement with
respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the
Designated Holders in this Agreement or grant any additional registration rights
to any Person or with respect to any securities which are not Registrable
Securities which are prior in right to or inconsistent with the rights granted
in this Agreement, except that the Company may grant the registration rights
held by the General Atlantic Stockholders to any Subsequent General Atlantic
Purchaser.

               (c) Remedies. The Designated Holders, in addition to being
                   --------
entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages,
shall be entitled to specific performance of their rights under this Agreement.
The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for
any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this
Agreement and hereby agrees to waive in any action for specific performance the
defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

               (d) Amendments and Waivers. Except as otherwise provided herein,
                   ----------------------
the provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented,
and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be
given unless consented to in writing by (i) the Company and (ii) the General
Atlantic Stockholders holding Registrable Securities representing (after giving
effect to any adjustments) at least a majority of the aggregate number of
Registrable Securities owned by all of the General Atlantic Stockholders. Any
such written consent shall be binding upon the Company and all of the Designated
Holders. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 9(d), the Company,
without the consent of any other party, may amend this Agreement to add any
Subsequent General Atlantic Purchaser as a party to this Agreement as a General
Atlantic Stockholder.

                                 ---------------

          8.1  Indemnification
               ---------------

          (a)  Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.4, the Company
(the "Company Indemnifying Party") agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
      --------------------------
each of the Purchasers and its Affiliates and their respective officers,
managers, directors, agents, employees, subsidiaries, partners, members and
controlling persons (each, an "Indemnified Party") to the fullest extent
                               -----------------
permitted by law from and against any and all losses, Claims, or written threats
thereof (including, without limitation, any Claim by a third party), damages,

party or otherwise in the manner described in Section 8.2 below) or other
liabilities (collectively, "Losses") resulting from or arising out of any breach
                            ------
of any representation or warranty, covenant or agreement by the Company in this
Agreement.

          (b)  Except as otherwise provided in this Article VIII, each Selling
Stockholder (each, a "Stockholder Indemnifying Party" and together with the
                      ------------------------------
Company Indemnifying Party, an "Indemnifying Party" and collectively, the
                                ------------------
"Indemnifying Parties"), severally, and not jointly, agrees to indemnify, defend

                                                                              22

Losses resulting from or arising out of any breach of any representation or
warranty made by such Stockholder Indemnifying Party in Article IV of this
Agreement.

          (c)  In connection with the obligation of the Indemnifying Parties to
indemnify for expenses as set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 8.1,
the Indemnifying Parties shall, subject to the provisions of Section 8.4, upon
                                                             -----------
presentation of appropriate invoices containing reasonable detail, reimburse
each Indemnified Party for all such expenses (including reasonable fees,
disbursements and other charges of counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party in
any action between the Indemnifying Parties and the Indemnified Party or between
the Indemnified Party and any third party) as they are incurred by such
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that if such expenses arise out of any
                   --------  -------
action, investigation or other proceeding commenced by an Indemnified Party
(other than as a result of any action, Claim or written threat by a third party
against the Indemnified Party), the Indemnifying Parties shall reimburse such
Indemnified Party for all such expenses only (x) after the final resolution or
disposition of such action, investigation or other proceeding and (y) if such
Indemnified Party prevails in such action, investigation or other proceeding;
and provided, further that if an Indemnified Party is reimbursed under this
Article VIII for any expenses, such reimbursement of expenses shall be refunded
to the extent it is finally judicially determined that such expenses resulted or
arose solely from the breach by such Indemnified Party of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement of such Indemnified Party contained in
this Agreement or the gross negligence, recklessness, willful or intentional
misconduct of the Indemnified Party.

          8.2  Notification. Each Indemnified Party under this Article VIII
               ------------
shall, promptly after the receipt of notice of the commencement of any Claim
against such Indemnified Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought from
the Indemnifying Parties under this Article VIII, notify the Indemnifying
Parties in writing of the commencement thereof. The omission of any Indemnified
Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party of any such action shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Parties from any liability which it may have to such
Indemnified Party (a) other than pursuant to this Article VIII or (b) under this
Article VIII unless, and only to the extent that, such omission results in such
Indemnifying Party's material prejudice or forfeiture of substantive rights or
defenses. In case any such Claim shall be brought against any Indemnified Party,
and it shall notify the Indemnifying Parties of the commencement thereof, the
Indemnifying Parties shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof at their
own expense, with counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in its
reasonable judgment; provided that any Indemnified Party may, at its own
expense, retain separate counsel to participate in such defense at its own
expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any Claim in which both the
Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and an Indemnified Party, on the other
hand, are, or are reasonably likely to become, a party, such Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to control its own defense
of such Claim if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such Indemnified
Party, either (x) one or more defenses are available to the Indemnified Party
that are not available to the Indemnifying Parties or (y) a conflict or
potential conflict exists between the Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and
such Indemnified Party, on the other hand, that would make such separate
representation advisable; provided, however, that subject

to the limitations set forth in Section 8.4 (i) the Indemnifying Parties shall
                                -----------
not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel to all
Indemnified Parties, (ii) in any action between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified
Parties for such fees and expenses only (x) after the final resolution or
disposition of such action and (y) if the Indemnified Party prevails in such
action and (iii) in any action between the Indemnified Parties and any third
party, the Indemnifying Parties shall reimburse the Indemnified Parties for such
fees and expenses as such fees and expenses are incurred. The Indemnifying
Parties agree that they will not, without the prior written consent of the
Purchasers, settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
pending or threatened Claim relating to the matters contemplated hereby (if any
Indemnified Party is a party thereto or has been actually threatened to be made
a party thereto) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all liability arising or
that may arise out of such Claim. The Indemnifying Parties shall not be liable
for any settlement of any Claim effected against an Indemnified Party without
its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                8.3 Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this
                    ------------
Article VIII from an Indemnifying Party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party
hereunder in respect of any Losses for which such Indemnified Party would
otherwise be required to indemnify the Indemnified Party under this Article
VIII, then, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.4, such
                                                    -----------
Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result
of such Losses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the
actions which resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative faults of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified
Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any
action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been
made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or
Indemnified Party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid
or payable by a party as a result of the Losses referred to above shall be
deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.4, any
                                                           -----------
legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in
connection with any investigation or proceeding.

                    ---------------------------------------

indemnification and contribution provided by the Company Indemnifying Party and
the Stockholder Indemnifying Parties pursuant to Sections 8.1(a), 8.1(b) and 8.3
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any Losses.

                (b) The amount of any payment by the Company Indemnifying Party
to the Indemnified Parties under this Article VIII in respect of Losses
resulting from or arising out of any indemnification or contribution claim made
pursuant to Section 8.1(a)

Party to the Indemnified Parties under this Article VIII in respect of Losses
resulting from or arising out of any indemnification or contribution claim made
pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.3 shall in no event exceed the aggregate
purchase price paid to such Stockholder Indemnifying Party in consideration of

financial transactions and the assets and business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP consistently applied.

                9.3 Inspection. As long as the Purchasers or Affiliates thereof
                    ----------
hold in the aggregate either (i) at least 5% of the shares of Common Stock

to this Agreement, the Company shall permit representatives of such Purchasers
to visit and inspect any of its properties and make copies of the Company's
corporate and financial records, and to discuss its affairs, finances and
accounts with its directors and officers, all at such reasonable times during
normal business hours and as often as may be reasonably requested upon
reasonable advance notice to the Company.

                9.4 Board Representation.
                    --------------------

                (a) The Company shall cause one vacancy to be created on its
Board of Directors (by increasing the number of members of the Board of
Directors or otherwise) and at such time cause to be elected to the Board of
Directors one person designated by GAP LP (the "General Atlantic Designee"),
                                                -------------------------
which designee shall initally be William O. Grabe. The General Atlantic Designee
shall serve in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws
until the next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders of the Company to be
held after such election for the purpose of electing directors of the class of
which the General Atlantic Designee is a member.

                (b) As long as the Purchasers or Affiliates thereof hold in the
aggregate either (i) at least 5% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding or
(ii) 30% of the Purchased Shares purchased by Purchasers pursuant to this
Agreement, commencing with the next succeeding annual meeting of the
stockholders of the Company at which directors of the class of which the General
Atlantic Designee is a member are elected, and at each annual meeting of the
stockholders of the Company thereafter held for the purpose of electing
directors of such class, GAP LP shall be entitled to designate to the Board of
Directors the General Atlantic Designee to serve as one of the directors of the
Company, which designee shall be reasonably acceptable to a majority of the
members of the Board of Directors. The Company shall cause such General Atlantic
Designee to be included in the slate of nominees recommended by the Board of
Directors to the Company's stockholders for election as directors, and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the election of such
General Atlantic Designee, including using its reasonably best efforts to cause
officers of the Company who hold proxies (unless otherwise directed by the
stockholder submitting such proxy) to vote such proxies in favor of the election
of such General Atlantic Designee. As long as the Purchasers or Affiliates
thereof hold in the aggregate either (i) at least 5% of the shares of Common
Stock outstanding or (ii) 30% of the Purchased Shares purchased by Purchasers
pursuant to this Agreement, in the event that the General Atlantic Designee
shall cease to serve as director for any reason, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the vacancy resulting thereby to be filled by
another designee of GAP LP.

issuance of shares of Common Stock or grant of options or warrants therefor in
connection with any present or future commercial borrowing, a line of credit
with a commercial bank, a leasing transaction with an equipment lessor or
similar financial leasing company, or a similar non-convertible debt financing
arrangement with a commercial lender that is not a private equity or venture
capital firm ((i)-(v) being referred to collectively as "Exempt Issuances"), if
                                                         ----------------
the Company wishes to issue any capital stock or any other securities
convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock of the Company pursuant to a
private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act
(collectively, "New Securities") to any Person (the "Subject Purchaser"), then
                --------------                       -----------------
the Company shall offer such New Securities first to the Purchasers by sending
written notice (the "New Issuance Notice") to the Purchasers, which New Issuance
                     -------------------
Notice shall state (x) the number of New Securities proposed to be issued and
(y) the proposed purchase price, or mechanism for determining the proposed
purchase price, per security of the New Securities (as calculated, the "Proposed
                                                                        --------
Price"). Upon delivery of the New Issuance Notice, such offer shall be
- -----
irrevocable unless and until the rights provided for in Section 9.5(b) shall
have been waived or shall have expired.

                (b) For a period of fifteen (15) days after the giving of a New
Issuance Notice, the Purchasers shall have the right to purchase up to the
entire portion of the New Securities at a purchase price equal to the Proposed
Price and upon the same terms and conditions set forth in the New Issuance
Notice. The Purchasers may transfer all or any portion of their rights pursuant
to this Section 9.5 to any Affiliate thereof.

                (c) The right of the Purchasers to purchase the New Securities
under subsection (b) above shall be exercisable by delivering written notice of
the exercise thereof, prior to the expiration of the 15-day period referred to
in subsection (b) above, to the Company, which notice shall state the amount of
New Securities that such Purchaser

                                                                              27

elects to purchase pursuant to Section 9.5(b). The failure of the Purchasers to
respond within such 15-day period shall be deemed to be a waiver of the
Purchasers' rights under Section 9.5(b), provided that the Purchasers may waive
their rights under Section 9.5(b) prior to the expiration of such 15-day period
by giving written notice to the Company. In the event that the aggregate number
of New Securities elected to be purchased by the Purchasers exceeds the total
number of New Securities, each Purchaser who has elected to purchase New
Securities shall be entitled to purchase only that portion of the New Securities
as the number of the number of New Securities elected to be purchased by such
Purchaser bears to the total number of New Securities elected to be purchased by
all Purchasers, subject to rounding by the Board of Directors to the extent it
deems reasonably necessary.

                (d) The closing of the purchase of New Securities subscribed for
by the Purchasers under this Section 9.5 shall be held at the executive office
of the Company at 11:00 a.m., local time, on (a) the 45th day after the giving
of the New Issuance Notice pursuant to Section 9.5(a), if the Purchasers elect
to purchase all of the New Securities under this Section 9.5, (b) the date of
the closing of the sale to the Subject Purchaser or Subject Purchasers if the
Purchasers elect to purchase some, but not all, of the New Securities under this
Section 9.5 or (c) at such other time and place as the parties to the
transaction may agree. At such closing, the Company shall deliver certificates
representing the New Securities, and such New Securities shall be issued free
and clear of all Liens (other than those arising hereunder and those
attributable to actions by the purchasers thereof) and the Company shall so
represent and warrant, and further represent and warrant that such New
Securities shall be, upon issuance thereof to the Purchasers and after payment
therefor, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The
Purchasers shall deliver at the closing payment in full in immediately available
funds for the New Securities purchased by them. At such closing, all of the
parties to the transaction shall execute such additional documents as are
otherwise necessary or appropriate.

PORTSMOUTH, NH - January 9, 2002 - Bottomline Technologies(R) (NASDAQ: EPAY), a
leading global technology provider of Financial Resource Management (FRM)

transaction from General Atlantic Partners, a leading global private equity

connection with the transaction, Bill Grabe, Partner with General Atlantic
Partners, will join the company's Board of Directors. Of the 2.7 million shares
being purchased, 2.1 million are newly issued shares by the Company with the
balance as secondary shares being sold in equal amounts by the Company's
founders, Dan McGurl and Jim Loomis. The cash proceeds will substantially
strengthen the Company's cash balance and facilitate an accelerated growth
strategy both domestically and internationally.

"We are extremely pleased to have General Atlantic as a financial and strategic

combine to accelerate our growth."

"Bottomline is uniquely positioned to lead the transformation of the B2B
payment infrastructure from paper bills to electronic payments," said Bill
Grabe, with General Atlantic. "The Company's world class technology and
products, deep domain expertise and dominant market share in both payment
automation and electronic invoice presentment, positions it very well for
continued market leadership. We are in the early days of this transformation and
we see tremendous growth opportunities both here and abroad. We are very excited
about Bottomline's prospects and look forward to working with the company."

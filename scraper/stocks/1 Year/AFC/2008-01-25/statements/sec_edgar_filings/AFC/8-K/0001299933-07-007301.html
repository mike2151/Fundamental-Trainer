On December 14, 2007, the Board of Directors of Allied Capital Corporation (the Company) made a determination that it is in the best interests of the Company to terminate its deferred compensation arrangements as described more fully below (each individually a Plan, or collectively, the Plans).  The Board of Directors' decision was primarily in response to increased complexity resulting from recent changes in the regulation of deferred compensation arrangements.<br><br>The Board of Directors resolved that The Allied Capital Corporation Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP I) and The Allied Capital Corporation Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan II (DCP II) will be terminated in accordance with the provisions of each of these Plans, and the accounts under these Plans will be distributed to participants in full on March 18, 2008, the termination and distribution date, or as soon as is reasonably practicable thereafter.<br><br>The Board of Directors also resolved to amend and restate The 2005 Alli
ed Capital Corporation Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (2005 DCP I) and The 2005 Allied Capital Corporation Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan II (2005 DCP II) to provide for termination of each of these Plans and distribution of the accounts under these Plans on March 18, 2008, or as soon as is reasonably practicable thereafter, in full in accordance with the transition rule for payment elections under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.<br><br>Distributions from the Plans will be made in cash or shares of Allied Capital common stock, net of required withholding taxes.  The assets of the rabbi trust related to DCP I and 2005 DCP I are primarily invested in assets other than shares of the Company&#x2019;s common stock.  At September 30, 2007, the liability to participants related to DCP I and 2005 DCP I was valued at $21.6 million in the aggregate, and that liability is fully funded by assets held in the rabbi trust.<br><br>The assets of the rabbi trust related to DCP II and 200
5 DCP II are primarily invested in shares of the Company&#x2019;s common stock.  At September 30, 2007, the liability to participants related to DCP II and 2005 DCP II was valued at $38.9 million in the aggregate, and that liability is fully funded by assets held in the rabbi trust.  At September 30, 2007, the rabbi trust held approximately 1.3 million shares for DCP II and 2005 DCP II. <br><br>The account balances in the Plans have accumulated as a result of prior compensation earned by the participants.  The contributions to the Plans reflect a combination of participant elective compensation deferrals and non-elective employer contributions, including contributions related to previously earned individual performance awards. As of September 30, 2007, the account balances of the named executive officers related to these Plans were $13.3 million for William Walton, $6.8 million for Joan Sweeney, $2.6 million for Penni Roll, $2.8 million for John Shulman, and $2.2 million for Michael Grisius.  <br><br>The amo
unts related to the Plans as of September 30, 2007, as described above, do not include the fourth quarter contribution to the 2005 DCP II, any additional participant elective deferrals that may occur prior to January 1, 2008, or earnings on or changes in the value of Plan account balances through the distribution date.<br><br>See the Amended and Restated 2005 Allied Capital Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan and the Amended and Restated 2005 Allied Capital Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan II, attached hereto. See also the Company&#x2019;s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, for a detailed description of the Plans.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>PREAMBLE</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>WHEREAS, </B>the Employer recognizes the unique qualifications of its Executives, employees, Directors
and Consultants and the valuable services that they have provided to or for the Employer; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>WHEREAS, </B>the Employer has previously adopted the amended and restated Non-Qualified Deferred
Compensation Plan of Allied Capital Corporation, which plan was frozen to new deferrals effective
December&nbsp;31, 2004, in order to provide retirement benefits to its Executives and employees based
upon compensation earned by them in excess of the compensation limit imposed on qualified
retirement plans by section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code and without regard to the
limitation on benefits or contributions under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and to allow
its Executives, Directors and Consultants to defer compensation that would otherwise be paid to
them for purposes of saving for retirement; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>WHEREAS</B>, the Employer has previously adopted the 2005 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan of
Allied Capital Corporation (the &#147;Plan&#148;) in order to be compliant with the requirements of new
Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code, effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2005; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>WHEREAS, </B>the Employer desires to amend and terminate the Plan;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>NOW, THEREFORE, </B>in consideration of the premises and of the provisions hereinafter set forth, the
Plan shall be and hereby is amended and restated, effective December&nbsp;14, 2007, as follows:


<P align="center" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>ARTICLE I<BR>
GENERAL</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>Section&nbsp;1.1 </B><U>Effective Date</U>. The provisions of this Plan shall be effective as of January
1, 2005. The rights, if any, of any person whose status as an employee, Executive, Director or
Consultant of the Employer terminates shall be determined pursuant to the Plan as in effect on the
date such employee, Executive, Director or Consultant terminates, unless a subsequently adopted
provision of the Plan is made specifically applicable to such person.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>Section&nbsp;1.2 </B><U>Purpose</U>. The purpose of the Plan is to provide retirement income to Executives
and employees based upon their compensation from the Company in excess of the amount of
compensation that may be taken into account by a qualified retirement plan described in section
401(a) of the Code and without regard to the limitation on benefits or contributions under section
415 of the Code.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">The Plan shall also provide Executives, Directors and certain Consultants with the opportunity to
defer receipt of amounts otherwise payable by the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>Section&nbsp;1.3 </B><U>Intent</U>. The Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan for the purpose of
providing deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees as
such group is described under Sections&nbsp;201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of ERISA, and a select
group of consultants. The Plan is not intended to be a plan described in Section 401(a) of the
Code. The obligation of the Company to make payments under this Plan constitutes nothing more than
an unsecured promise of the Company to make such payments, and any property of the Company that may
be set aside for the payment of benefits under the Plan shall, in the event of the Company&#146;s
bankruptcy or insolvency, remain subject to the claims of the Company&#146;s general creditors until
such benefits are distributed in accordance with Article&nbsp;V herein.

spouse, or a dependent (as defined in Code Section&nbsp;152(a)) of the Participant, loss of the
Participant&#146;s property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable

distribution may not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Participant&#146;s emergency (including
any amounts necessary to pay any federal, state or local income taxes or penalties reasonably
anticipated to result from the distribution); and (b)&nbsp;the Participant must have obtained all
distributions, other than hardship distributions, and all nontaxable loans (determined at the time
of the loan) currently available under all qualified plans maintained by the Employer. A hardship
distribution on account of an unforeseeable emergency shall be made from this Plan prior to any

payments and any property of the Company that may be set aside for the payment of benefits under
the Plan shall, in the event of the Company&#146;s bankruptcy or insolvency, remain subject to the

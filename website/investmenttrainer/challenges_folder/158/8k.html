     in this agreement is not limited:

     (a)  by reference to any other paragraph of Schedule 5; or

     (b)  by anything in this agreement or the Tax Deed,

     and none of the Warranties shall be treated as qualified by any actual or
     constructive knowledge on the part of the Purchaser.

(3)  Each Seller agrees with the Purchaser (as trustee for each Company and its
     employees) to waive any rights or claims which he may have in respect of
     any misrepresentation, inaccuracy or omission in or from any information or
     advice supplied or given by any Company or its employees in connection with
     the giving of the Warranties and the preparation of the Disclosure Letter.

(4)  Without prejudice to any other remedy available to the Purchaser or its
     ability to claim damages on any basis which is available to it by reason of
     any of the Warranties being untrue or misleading or being breached, each
     Seller undertakes with the Purchaser (for itself and as trustee for each
     Company) that he shall, at the direction of the Purchaser, pay to the
     Purchaser, the Company concerned or (in the case of liability to another
     person which has not been discharged) the person to whom the liability has
     been incurred an amount equal to any deficiency or liability of the Company
     concerned which arises from any of the Warranties being untrue, misleading
     or breached and which would not have existed or arisen if the Warranty in
     question had not been untrue, misleading or breached.  For the avoidance of
     doubt, nothing in the clause shall relieve the Purchaser of its general
     legal obligation to mitigate any loss or damage if any.

(5)  Save for Warranty A.4 which shall not be limited in any way, in the absence
     of fraud, dishonesty or wilful concealment on the part of the Sellers or
     their agents the liability of the Sellers in respect of all claims under
     the Warranties and for the Tax Deed:

     (a)  shall not in aggregate exceed the amount of the First Retention and
          Escrow Agreement;

     (b)  shall not arise (i) for any claim less than (Pounds)5,000; or

          (ii) (when aggregated with any liability under the Tax Deed) unless
          the amount of all claims made in respect of the Warranties and/or the
          Tax Deed (or which would have been made but for the operation of this
          sub-clause 5 or the corresponding provision in the Tax Deed) exceeds
          (Pounds)50,000; and

     (c)  shall terminate;

          (i)  subject to clause 5(6)(b) on the first anniversary of Completion
               (the "Tax Term") in respect of those matters set out in Part D
               (Taxation)
________________________________________________________________________________

________________________________________________________________________________

               of Schedule 5 and any other matters so far as they relate to
               taxation; and

          (ii) on the first anniversary of Completion in respect of all other
               matters contained in Schedule 5,

          except in respect of any claim of which notice in writing stating in
          reasonable detail the nature of the claim (and if possible the amount
          claimed) is given to the Sellers or the Sellers' Solicitors before
          that date,

     (d)  The Liability of the Sellers under Warranty A4 shall not exceed the
          Consideration.

(6)  (a)  The Sellers' Representative undertakes on behalf of all the Sellers to
          effect and maintain insurance (the "Insurance") in accordance with the
          instructions of the Purchaser but not to be less than for a period to
          the third anniversary of Completion (such instructions to be given no
          later than 120 days from Completion), with regard to liability to
          taxation, arising or incurred in respect of those matters set out in
          part D (Taxation) of Schedule 5 and/or the Tax Deed.  The parties
          hereby agree that the cost of effecting and maintaining such insurance
          shall not exceed $250,000, fifty percent of such cost to be borne by
          the Sellers and deposited by them in the First Retention and Escrow
          Account in accordance with the terms therein and the remaining cost to
          be borne by the Purchaser.

     (b)  In the event that insurance is effected, or if the Sellers'
          Representative does not comply with the Purchaser's reasonable
          instruction as detailed above, the Tax Term shall increase to the
          third anniversary of Completion and the liability of the Sellers under
          the taxation warranties and/or the Tax Deed by the amount of the
          Insurance or if insurance is not effected due to the reason of the
          Seller's Representative failing to comply with the Purchaser's
          reasonable instructions by the amount of US$8 million.

     (c)  For the avoidance of doubt, if insurance is effected and maintained
          between Completion and the third anniversary then the Sellers shall
          have no liability whatsoever for any claim set out in part D
          (Taxation) of Schedule 5 and/or the Tax Deed other than as provided
          for and paid (regardless of any excess or other limitations imposed by
          the policy relating to the Insurance) in full by the Insurance.

(7)  Any payment made by the Sellers in respect of a breach of the Warranties or
     a liability under the Tax Deed shall be deemed to be a reduction in the
     Consideration.

(8)  Except for Warranty A.4 and which shall not be limited in any way, the
     Sellers' liability under the Warranties shall be limited as detailed in
     Schedule 6.

(9)  The liability of the Sellers for Warranty A.4 in Schedule 5 and for the
     covenants under clause 2(1), 2(2) and 2(3) is several.

6.   PURCHASER WARRANTIES

(1)  The Purchaser is a corporation duly organised, validly existing and in good
     standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

(2)  The Purchaser has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver
     this agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder.  The execution and
     delivery by the Purchaser of this agreement and the consummation by the
     Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
     validly authorised by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
     Purchaser.

(3)  The Purchaser certifies and represents to the Company that at the time the
     Purchaser acquires any of the Shares, the Purchaser will be an "accredited
     investor" as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the
     Securities Act.  The Purchaser's financial condition is such that it is
     able to bear the risk of holding the Shares for an indefinite period of
     time and the risk of loss of its entire investment.  Without prejudice to
     the representations and warranties given by the Sellers herein, the
     Purchaser has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of and receive
     answers from the management of the Company concerning this investment and
     has sufficient knowledge and experience in investing in companies similar
     to the Company in terms of the Company's stage of development so as to be
     able to evaluate the risks and merits of its investment in the Company.

     Purchaser.

8.   Sellers' COVENANTS

(1)  Each of P Fortune, C Peck, S Cutler, A McCallum, P Rooke, J Clarke, C.

          carrying on business in the United Kingdom which is competitive or

          a customer of a Company; or

     (c)  for a period of two years from Completion induce or attempt to induce

          any other name intended or likely to be confused with such a trade
          name.

(2)  For the purposes of subclause (1) above:

     (a)  a Key Executive is concerned in a business if he carries it on as
          principal or agent or if:

          (i)   he is a partner, director, employee, secondee, consultant or
                agent in, of or to any person who carries on the business; or

          (ii)  he has any direct or indirect financial interest (as shareholder
                or otherwise) in any person who carries on the business; or

          (iii) he is a partner, director, employee, secondee, consultant or
                agent in, of or to any person who has a direct or indirect
                financial interest (as shareholder or otherwise) in any person
                who carries on the business,

          disregarding any financial interest of a person in securities which
          are listed or traded on any generally recognised market if that
          person, the Key Executive and any person connected with him or them
          (the "Investors") are together interested in securities which amount
          to less than five per cent. of the issued securities of that class and
          which, in all circumstances, carry less than five per cent. of the
          voting rights (if any) attaching to the issued securities of that
          class, and provided that none of the Investors is involved in the
          management of the business of the issuer of the securities or of any
          person connected with it other than by the exercise of voting rights
          attaching to the securities; and

     (b)  references to a Company include its successors in business;


     (c)  the restrictions in this clause 8 shall not apply to N Savory or P
          Fannon respectively  if the respective individual is dismissed by the
          Company from its employ for reasons other for gross misconduct.

(3)  Each of the restrictions in each paragraph or subclause above shall be
     enforceable by the Purchaser independently of each of the others and its
     validity shall not be affected if any of the others is invalid.

                                      11

________________________________________________________________________________


(4)  If any of those restrictions is void but would be valid if some part of the
     restrictions were deleted the restriction in question shall apply with such
     modification as may be necessary to make it valid.

(5)  The Key Executives acknowledge that the above provisions of this clause are
     no more extensive than is reasonable to protect the Purchaser as the
     purchaser of the Shares.

(6)  If by virtue of any provision of this agreement or of any other agreement
     or arrangement of which this agreement forms part, such agreement or
     arrangement is subject to registration under the Restrictive Trade
     Practices Act 1976 (as amended) and is not a non-notifiable agreement, none
     of the parties to such agreement or arrangement who carries on business
     within the United Kingdom shall give effect to, or enforce or purport to
     enforce the agreement or arrangement in respect of any such provision until

     furnished to the Director General of Fair Trading under section 24 of that
     Act.

(7)  The Key Executives covenant with the Purchaser to procure that all relevant

     working papers of any and all accountants of the Company), required by the
     Purchaser to prepare and submit the financial statements required by Item 7
     of Form 8-K shall be made available to the Purchaser within the period
     contemplated by instruction B to such Form.

(8)  For the avoidance of doubt and for the purposes of this clause 8 the
     "business carried on by the Company at Completion" shall not include the
     electro-mechanical business of Checkpoint Security Services Limited carried
     on prior to Completion.

9.   COMPLETION

          (iii)  the certificate of incorporation, common seal, minute books,

                 would have done so by giving a notice which would have
                 contained a statement in accordance with section 394 of the
                 Companies Act and that the amount due to them by each Company
                 on account of fees and expenses does not in aggregate exceed

                 previous business week preceding Completion together with a
                 list of all unpresented cheques and uncleared lodgements which

          (xii)  written undertakings from Smith and Williamson to co-operate

10.  GUARANTEES

(1)  The Sellers shall procure that on Completion each Company is released from

     The Sellers shall procure that all bank accounts (the "Bank Account")
     maintained by the Company shall at Completion contain in unconditionally

     Shortfall.


12.  REGISTRATION RIGHTS

(1)  Required Registration of Demand Shares
     --------------------------------------

     Immediately following the Completion, the Sellers who hold in aggregate at
     least 270,000 shares (representing 20% of the Consideration Shares) may
     request in writing, on no more than two occasions during the first twenty-
     four months following the Completion, that the Purchaser register for sale
     under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the "Securities Act") a
     number of Consideration Shares which shall neither (i) exceed in the
     aggregate a number equal to (A) $35,000,000 divided by (B)

________________________________________________________________________________
<PAGE>

                                      14

________________________________________________________________________________


     the average last reported sale price per share of the Purchaser's Common
     Stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten consecutive trading days
     preceding the date of this Agreement nor (ii) in either instance be less
     than the number equal to (A) $7,000,000 divided by (B) the last reported
     sale price per share of the Purchaser's Common Stock on the Nasdaq National
     Market for the ten consecutive trading days preceding the date of this
     Agreement (the "Demand Shares"). The Purchaser shall file with the
     Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), within 60 days following
     receipt of any such request, a registration statement on Form S-3 covering
     the resale to the public by the Sellers of the Demand Shares (the "Seller
     Registration Statement"). The Purchaser shall use its best efforts to cause
     the Seller Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as
     soon as practicable, provided that the Seller Registration Statement shall
                          --------
     not be declared effective until after the Purchaser has filed a Form 8-K
     covering the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, if such Form 8-K
     is required to be filed pursuant to Rule 13a-11 or Rule 15d-11 of the
     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Purchaser shall cause the
     Seller Registration Statement to remain effective until the date two years
     after the date of Completion or such earlier time as all of the Demand
     Shares covered by the Seller Registration Statement have been sold pursuant
     thereto.

(2)  Limitations on Registration Rights
     ----------------------------------

     (a)  The Purchaser may, by written notice to the Sellers, (i) delay the
          filing or effectiveness of the Seller Registration Statement or (ii)
          suspend the Seller Registration Statement after effectiveness and
          require that the Sellers immediately cease sales of shares pursuant to
          the Seller Registration Statement, in the event that (A) the Purchaser
          files a registration statement (other than a registration statement on
          Form S-8 or its successor form) with the SEC for a primary public
          offering of its securities for acquisition purposes, financing or
          otherwise, or (B) the Purchaser is engaged in any activity or
          transaction or preparations or negotiations for any activity or
          transaction the disclosure of which would be adverse in its reasonable
          judgement, if the Purchaser determines in good faith that the public
          disclosure requirements imposed on the Purchaser under the Securities
          Act in connection with the Seller Registration Statement would require
          disclosure of such activity, transaction, preparations or
          negotiations; provided that, in such event: (A) Such Sellers shall be
          entitled to withdraw any such request made under subclause (1) and, if
          withdrawn, such request shall not count as one of the two requests for
          required registration of Demand Shares permitted under subclause 1,
          and (B) the 12 month period for required registration of Demand Shares
          pursuant to subclause 1 shall be tolled for the duration of the
          resultant delay or suspension.  Notwithstanding anything to the
          contrary herein, in any 365-day period, the Purchaser shall not
          exercise its rights under this subclause 2(a) to suspend sales of
          Demand Shares (i) more than twice or (ii) for a total period in excess
          of 120 days.

     (b)  If the Purchaser delays or suspends the Seller Registration Statement
          or requires the Sellers to cease sales of shares pursuant to paragraph
          (a) above,

________________________________________________________________________________
<PAGE>

                                      15

________________________________________________________________________________


          the Purchaser shall, as promptly as practicable following the
          termination of the circumstance which entitled the Purchaser to do so
          with the Seller's approval, take such actions as may be necessary to
          file or reinstate the effectiveness of the Seller Registration
          Statement and/or give written notice to all Sellers authorizing them
          to resume sales pursuant to the Seller Registration Statement. If as a
          result thereof the prospectus included in the Seller Registration
          Statement has been amended to comply with the requirements of the
          Securities Act, the Purchaser shall enclose such revised prospectus
          with the notice to Sellers given pursuant to this paragraph (b), and
          the Sellers shall make no offers or sales of shares pursuant to the
          Seller Registration Statement other than by means of such revised
          prospectus.

(3)  Registration Procedures
     -----------------------

     (a)  In connection with the filing by the Purchaser of the Seller
          Registration Statement, the Purchaser shall furnish to each Seller a
          copy of the prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in
          conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act.

     (b)  The Purchaser shall use its best efforts to register or qualify the
          Demand Shares covered by the Seller Registration Statement under the
          securities laws of each state of the United States and do any and all
          other acts and things which may reasonably be necessary or advisable
          to enable the Sellers to consummate the disposition in such
          jurisdictions of the Consideration Shares owned by the Sellers;
          provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not be required in
          --------  -------
          connection with this paragraph (b) to qualify as a foreign corporation
          or execute a general consent to service of process in any
          jurisdiction.

     (c)  If the Purchaser has delivered preliminary or final prospectuses to
          the Sellers and after having done so the prospectus is amended or
          supplemented to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act,
          the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Sellers and, if requested by
          the Purchaser, the Sellers shall immediately cease making offers or
          sales of shares under the Seller Registration Statement and return all
          prospectuses to the Purchaser.  The Purchaser shall promptly provide
          the Sellers with revised or supplemented prospectuses and, following
          receipt of the revised or supplemented prospectuses, the Sellers shall
          be free to resume making offers and sales under the Seller
          Registration Statement.

     (d)  The Purchaser shall otherwise use all reasonable commercial efforts to
          comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and make
          available to the Sellers, as soon as reasonably practicable, an
          earning statement covering the period of at least 12 months beginning
          with the first day of the Purchaser's first full calendar quarter
          after the effective date of the Seller Registration Statement, which
          earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of
          the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder.

________________________________________________________________________________


     (e)  The Purchaser shall pay the expenses incurred by it in complying with
          its obligations under this clause 11, including all registration and
          filing fees, exchange listing fees, fees and expenses of counsel for
          the Purchaser, fees and expenses of accountants for the Purchaser and
          reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel retained by the Sellers
          who are not employees of the Company immediately prior to the
          Completion, for the purposes of rendering legal opinion on behalf of
          such non-employee Sellers in connection with any underwritten
          registration of Demand Shares or Incidental Registration, but
          excluding (i) any brokerage fees, selling commissions or underwriting
          discounts incurred by the Sellers in connection with sales under the
          Seller Registration Statement and (ii) the fees and expenses of any
          counsel retained by Sellers, other than as referred to in this clause
          11(e).

     (4)  Requirements of Sellers
          -----------------------

          The Purchaser shall not be required to include any Demand Shares in
          the Seller Registration Statement unless  the Seller owning such
          shares furnishes to the Purchaser in writing such information
          regarding such Seller and the proposed sale of Demand Shares by such
          Seller as the Purchaser may reasonably request in writing in
          connection with the Seller Registration Statement or as shall be
          required in connection therewith by the SEC or any state securities
          law authorities.

     (5)  Incidental Registration of Consideration Shares
          -----------------------------------------------

          (a)  Whenever the Purchaser proposes to file a registration statement
               (other than the Seller Registration Statement filed pursuant to
               subclause 1) at any time and from time to time until three years
               from the date of the Completion, it will, prior to such filing,
               give prompt written notice to the Sellers of its intention to do
               so; provided, that no such notice need be given if no
               Consideration Shares are to be included therein as a result of a
               determination of the managing underwriter pursuant to subclause
               5(b). Upon the written request of any Sellers given within 20
               days after the Purchaser provides such notice (which request
               shall state the intended method of disposition of such
               Consideration Shares), the Purchaser shall use its best efforts
               to cause all Consideration Shares which the Purchaser has been
               requested by such Sellers to register to be registered under the
               Securities Act to the extent necessary to permit their sale or
               other disposition in accordance with the intended methods of
               distribution specified in the request of such Sellers; provided
               that the Purchaser shall have the right to postpone or withdraw
               any registration effected pursuant to this subclause 5 without
               obligation to the Sellers.

     (b)  If the registration for which the Purchaser gives notice pursuant to
          subclause 5(a) is a registered public offering involving an
          underwriting, the Purchaser shall so advise the Sellers as a part of
          the written notice given pursuant to subclause 5(a).  In such event,
          the right of the Sellers to include their Consideration Shares in such
          registration pursuant to subclause 5 shall be

________________________________________________________________________________
<PAGE>

                                      17

________________________________________________________________________________


          conditioned upon the Sellers' participation in such underwriting on
          the terms set forth herein. Should any Sellers propose to distribute
          the Consideration Shares through such underwriting, such Sellers shall
          enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the
          underwriter or underwriters selected for the underwriting by the
          Purchaser. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subclause 5, if
          the managing underwriter advises the Purchaser in good faith that the
          inclusion of all shares requested to be registered would adversely
          affect the offering, the Purchaser may limit the number of
          Consideration Shares to be included in the registration and
          underwriting. The Purchaser shall so advise all holders of
          Consideration Shares requesting registration, and the number of shares
          that are entitled to be included in the registration and underwriting
          shall be allocated in the following manner. The securities of the
          Purchaser held by holders other than the Sellers and other holders of
          securities of the Purchasers who are entitled, by contract with the
          Purchaser, to have securities included in such registration ("Other
          Holders") shall be excluded from such registration and underwriting to
          the extent deemed advisable by the managing underwriter, and, if a
          further limitation on the number of shares is required, the number of
          shares that may be included in such registration and underwriting
          shall be allocated among the Sellers and Other Holders requesting
          registration in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the
          respective number of shares of Common Stock (on an as-converted basis)
          which they held at the time the Company gives the notice specified in
          subclause 5(a); provided that such registration rights of the Sellers
          and Other Holders shall be subordinate to the written registration
          rights of certain additional holders of securities of the Purchaser
          outstanding as of the date hereof. If the Sellers or any Other Holder
          requesting registration would thus be entitled to include more
          securities than such holder requested to be registered, the excess
          shall be allocated among the Sellers and Other Holders requesting
          registration pro rata in the manner described in the preceding
          sentence. If the Sellers requesting registration disapprove of the
          terms of any such underwriting, such Sellers may elect to withdraw
          therefrom by written notice to the Purchaser, and any Consideration
          Shares or other securities excluded or withdrawn from such
          underwriting shall be withdrawn from such registration.

(6)  Indemnification
     ---------------

     (a)  The Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Seller whose
          shares are included in any registration statement filed with the SEC
          pursuant to this clause 11 (the "Registration Statement") against any
          losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities to which such Seller
          may become subject by reason of any untrue statement of a material
          fact contained in the Registration Statement, prospectus, preliminary
          prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission to
          state therein a fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
          make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such
          losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities arise out of or are
          based upon information furnished to the Purchaser by or on behalf of a
          Seller in writing for use in the Registration Statement.  The
          Purchaser shall have the right to

________________________________________________________________________________
<PAGE>

                                      18

________________________________________________________________________________


          assume the defense and settlement of any claim or suit for which the
          Purchaser may be responsible for indemnification under this subclause
          6.

     (b)  The Sellers agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser against
          any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities to which the
          Purchaser may become subject by reason of any untrue statement of a
          material fact contained in the Registration Statement, prospectus,
          preliminary prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any
          omission to state therein a fact required to be stated therein or
          necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, if the
          statement or omission was made in reliance on and in conformity with
          information relating to the Sellers furnished in writing to the
          Purchaser by or on behalf of the Sellers for use in connection with
          the preparation of the Registration Statement.  Provided that any such
          Seller's obligation to indemnify under this sub clause 6 (b) shall be
          individual, rather than joint and several, and shall be limited to the
          net amount of proceeds received by such Seller from the sale of
          Consideration Shares pursuant to such Registration Statement.

(7)  Assignment of Rights
     --------------------

     A Seller may not assign any of its rights under this clause 11 except in
     connection with the transfer of some or all of his, her or its
     Consideration Shares to a child or spouse, or trust for their benefit or,
     in the case of a partnership, to the partners of such partnership pursuant
     to a pro rata distribution, and in the case of MAM to its subsidiary,
     holding company or other affiliate provided each such transferee agrees in
                                       ---------
     a written instrument delivered to the Purchaser to be bound by the
     provisions of this clause 11.

(8)  Investment and Experience
     -------------------------

     Each Seller will hereby be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows
     (terms used herein that are defined in Regulation S under the Securities
     Act are used as defined therein):

     (a)  The Seller (i) is a non-U.S. person outside the United States
          acquiring the Consideration Shares for its own account, and (ii) is
          aware that such Consideration Shares are restricted securities and
          that such Consideration Shares may not be deposited into any
          unrestricted depositary facility in respect of the Shares established
          or maintained by a depositary bank, unless at the time of deposit such
          Consideration Shares are eligible for transfer in accordance with Rule
          144(k) under the Securities Act.

     (b)  The Seller understands that the Consideration Shares have not been
          registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered, resold,
          pledged or otherwise transferred except (i)(A) in an offshore
          transaction complying with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S or (B)
          pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
          provided by Rule 144 thereunder (if available) and (ii)

________________________________________________________________________________
<PAGE>

                                      19

________________________________________________________________________________


          in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the
          United States. No representation can be made as to the availability of
          the exemption provided by Rule 144 for resales of the Consideration
          Shares.

     (c)  If the Seller is acquiring Consideration Shares for the account of
          another person, it has full power to make the foregoing
          acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each
          such account.

     (d)  The Seller acknowledges that the Purchaser, its affiliates and others
          will rely on the truth and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgements,
          representations and agreements.

     Any resale or other transfer, or attempted resale or other transfer, made
     other than in compliance with the above-stated restrictions shall not be
     recognized by the Purchaser.

     Due to the restrictions on the offer and sale of securities in the United
     States, under U.S. securities laws and regulations, there can be no
     assurance that any offer of pre-emptive right will be open to U.S. holders
     of Consideration Shares.

     The Consideration Shares will bear a legend to the following effect, unless
     the Purchaser determines otherwise in compliance with applicable law:

          THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES (DE), INC.
          REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
          OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT").  THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT
          BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED (NOR MAY IT
          OTHERWISE HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE WITH RESPECT TO THE SHARES) EXCEPT (A)(1)
          IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION COMPLYING WITH RULE 903 OR RULE 904 OF
          REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, OR (2) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION
          FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT PROVIDE BY RULE 144
          THEREUNDER (IF AVAILABLE), AND (B) IN EACH CASE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL
          APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES.  NO REPRESENTATION
          CAN BE MADE AS TO THE AVAILABILITY OF THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED BY RULE
          144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT FOR RESALE OF THE SHARES.


13.  Announcements

     No party shall make or permit any person connected with him to make any
     announcement concerning this sale and purchase or any ancillary matter
     before, on or after Completion except as required by law or any competent
     regulatory body or with the written approval of the other parties, such
     approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

of Buyer Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of common stock of
the Company which could have been purchased under the terms of the Company Stock
Option (regardless of whether or not such option is vested) multiplied by the
quotient of $115.38 divided by the Acquisition Share Value. The exercise price
for each Assumed Option shall be determined by multiplying the exercise price of
the Company Stock Option by the quotient of the Acquisition Share Value divided
by $115.38.

          (c)  The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to register
the assumed Company Stock Options on a Form S-8 Registration Statement within 90
days following the Closing Date.

no Shares shall be deemed to be outstanding and held by any person other than

the merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368
of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the

transaction to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A)
of the Code. Such merger shall occur on or before December 31, 2000.

     1.10. S-3 Registration Statement. In the event that the Buyer shall
           ---------------------------
register shares of Buyer Common Stock on a Form S-3 Registration Statement at
any time after the Closing and prior to the first anniversary thereof, the Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to include 11,178 shares (the "S-3
Shares") of Buyer Common Stock, which constitute a portion of the Acquisition
Consideration paid to the Company

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

Stockholder pursuant to Section 1.5; provided that, if the Buyer reasonably
determines that marketing factors or contractual requirements with other parties
require a limitation of the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to be
included in such registration, then such S-3 Shares may be excluded; and,
provided further, that, if the Buyer is engaged in any business activity that,
in the good faith determination of the Chief Financial Officer of the Buyer,
would be adversely affected by including the S-3 Shares in such registration,
then the Buyer may at its option elect that the S-3 Shares not be included in
that registration.

     1.11. Indemnification Shares. In accordance with the provisions of Section
           ----------------------
4.5 (c) hereof, the Buyer and the Company Stockholder have agreed that to the
extent that the Buyer has a Claim for Buyer's Damages, in each case as defined
in Article IV hereof, that Buyer shall seek to satisfy such claim, first against
the Acquisition Escrow Shares and, second by requiring the Company Stockholder
to satisfy such Claim by delivering to the Buyer Indemnification Shares, as
defined in Section 4.5 (c). In that connection, the Buyer shall be prohibited
from transferring 59,618 Shares of Buyer Common Stock (the "Reserved Shares")
received as Acquisition Consideration until the later of (1) with respect to all
of the Reserved Shares, one year after the Closing and (2) with respect to
Claimed Shares, as defined below, until a final resolution of such Claim has
been effected. "Claimed Shares" shall mean all or a portion of the Reserved
Shares with respect to which a Claim has been made by the Buyer prior to the
first anniversary of the Closing. A portion of the Acquisition Consideration to
be delivered to the Company Stockholder at the Closing shall consist of a stock
certificate representing the Reserved Shares (the "Reserved Shares
Certificate"). The Reserved Shares Certificate shall bear the following legend:

           "The shares represented by this certificate are subject to certain
     restrictions and limitations on transfer set forth in a stock purchase
     agreement between the corporation and the holder hereof, a copy of which
     agreement may be inspected by the holder of this certificate at the
     principal offices of the corporation, or furnished by the corporation to
     the holder of this certificate upon written request without charge."

Upon the request of the Company Stockholder at any time after the first
anniversary of the Closing, the Buyer shall direct its transfer agent to remove
the foregoing legend with respect to all of the Reserved Shares other than
Claimed Shares.

except as set forth in the disclosure schedule provided by the Company and the

     2.1.  Organization, Qualification and Corporate Power. The Company is a
           -----------------------------------------------
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in corporate and tax good
standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Company is
duly qualified to conduct business and is in corporate and tax good standing
under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the nature of its businesses or the
ownership or leasing of its properties requires such qualification, except where
the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company has all requisite
corporate power and authority to carry on the businesses in which it is engaged
and to own and use the properties owned and used by it. The Company has
furnished to the Buyer complete and accurate copies of its Articles of
Organization and By-laws. The Company is not in default under or in violation of
any provision of its Articles of Organization or By-laws. For purposes of this

owned by the Company Stockholder and are held free and clear of all mortgages,
pledges, liens, security interests, restrictions, conditional sales agreements,

Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of all optionholders of the
Company, indicting the number of options exercisable for common stock of the
Company held by each such option holder and the vesting schedule of such
options. Other than the 78,000 Company Shares owned by the Company Stockholder
and the options listed in Section 2.2 of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no
outstanding or authorized shares of capital stock or warrants, rights,
agreements or commitments to which the Company is a party or which are binding
upon the Company providing for the issuance or redemption of any of its capital
stock. There are no outstanding or authorized stock appreciation, phantom stock
or similar rights with respect to the Company. Other than as set forth in

pre-emptive rights, rights of first refusal, co-sale rights or "drag-along"
rights) of any Shares and, with respect to any other securities of the Company,
to the best knowledge of

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

which either is not bound, with respect to the voting (including without
limitation voting trusts or proxies) or sale or transfer (including without
limitation agreements relating to rights of first refusal, co-sale rights or
"drag-along" rights) of any securities of the Company. All of the issued and
outstanding Shares were issued in compliance with applicable federal and state
securities laws.

     2.3.  Authorization of Transaction. The Company has all requisite corporate
           ----------------------------
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action
on the part of the Company. This Agreement, including the exhibits hereto, to
which the Company or the Company Stockholder is a party, has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Company and the Company Stockholder, as
the case may be, and constitutes valid and binding obligations enforceable
against the Company and the Company Stockholder in accordance with their
respective terms subject to laws of general application from time to time in
effect affecting creditors' rights and the exercise of judicial discretion in
accordance with general equitable principles. The Company Stockholder has the
full right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to transfer,
convey and sell to the Buyer at the Closing the Shares to be sold hereunder and,
upon consummation of the purchase contemplated hereby, the Buyer will acquire
from the Company Stockholder good and marketable title to the Shares, free and

liens, charges, encumbrances, options and adverse claims or rights whatsoever.

     2.4.  Noncontravention. Neither the execution and delivery by the Company
           ----------------
or the Company Stockholder of this Agreement or the execution and delivery by
the Company Stockholder of the Company Stockholder Escrow Agreement, nor the
consummation by the Company or the Company Stockholder of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, as the case may be, will (a)
conflict with or violate any provision of the Articles of Organization or By-
laws of the Company, (b) require on the part of the Company or the Company
Stockholder any filing with, or any permit, authorization, consent or approval
of, any court, arbitration tribunal, administrative agency or commission or

or instrument to which the Company or the Company Stockholder is a party or by
which the Company or the Company Stockholder is bound or to which any of their
respective assets is subject, (d) result in the imposition of any encumbrance,
charge, lien or security interest (collectively, "Security Interest") upon any
assets of the Company or the Company Stockholder, except with respect to the

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

assets of the Company where, individually or in the aggregate, such Security
Interest would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (e) violate any
order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the
Company or the Company Stockholder, or any of their respective  properties or
assets.

     2.5. Subsidiaries.  There is no corporation, partnership, joint venture or
          ------------
other entity in which the Company has, directly or indirectly, an equity
interest representing 50% or more of the capital stock thereof or other equity
interests therein.

cash flows as of and for each of the last three fiscal years and unaudited
consolidated balance sheet and statement of income as of and for the six months
ended as of June 30, 2000 (the "Most Recent Balance Sheet Date"). Such financial
statements (collectively, the "Financial Statements") have been prepared on a
consistent basis throughout the periods covered thereby, fairly present the
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of
the respective dates thereof and for the periods referred to therein and are
consistent with the books and records of the Company.

          (b)  The Company Stockholder and the Company have such records as are
necessary to permit the Company, or its successor, to prepare audited financial
statements for the past three fiscal years of the Company.

     2.7. Absence of Certain Changes.  To the knowledge of the Company and the
          --------------------------
Company Stockholder, there has occurred no event or development since the Most
Recent Balance Sheet Date which has had, or could reasonably be expected to have
in the future, a Company Material Adverse Effect.  Since the Most Recent Balance
Sheet Date, the Company has not:  (i) other than a capital contribution of
22,000 shares of Company Common Stock by the Company Stockholder and as set
forth in Section 2.7(iii) of the Disclosure Schedule, acquired, sold, leased,
licensed or disposed of any assets or property, other than purchases and sales
of assets in the Ordinary Course of Business (as defined below); (ii) mortgaged
or pledged any of its property or assets or subjected any such property or
assets to any Security Interest; (iii) except for discharges and satisfaction of

or paid any obligation or liability other than in the Ordinary Course of
Business; (iv) changed in any material respect its accounting methods,

Disclosure Schedule (the "New Options"), issued or sold any stock or other
securities of the Company or any rights, warrants or options to acquire any such
stock or other securities, or, except for the amendment and termination of
certain agreements listed in Section 2.7 (vi) of the Disclosure Schedule,
amended any of the terms of any existing options or warrants; (vii) declared,
set aside or paid any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or
property or any combination thereof) in respect of its capital

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

obligations of any other person or entity, or made any loans, advances or
capital contributions to, or investments in any other person or entity; or (ix),
except for payments and contributions set forth in Section 2.2 (ix) of the
Disclosure Schedule, increased in any manner the compensation or fringe benefits
of, or materially modified the employment terms of any agreements with, any of
its directors, officers or employees, or paid any bonus or other benefit to any
of its directors, officers or employees.

     2.8. Undisclosed Liabilities. The Company has no liability (whether
          -----------------------
absolute or contingent, whether liquidated or unliquidated and whether due or to
become due), except for (a) liabilities shown on the Most Recent Balance Sheet,
(b) liabilities which have arisen since the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date in
the Ordinary Course of Business (as defined below) and (c) contractual and other
liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business which are not required
by GAAP to be reflected on a balance sheet. For the purpose of this Agreement,
"Ordinary Course of Business" means the ordinary course of the Company's
business, consistent in all material respects with past custom and practice
(including with respect to frequency and amount).

     2.9. Tax Matters.
          -----------

          (a)  The Company has filed on a timely basis all reports, returns,
declarations, statements or other information required to be supplied to all
taxing authorities in connection with all taxes ("Tax Returns") that it was
required to file, and all such Tax Returns were complete and accurate in all
material respects. The Company has never been a member of a group of
corporations with which it has filed (or been required to file) consolidated,
combined or unitary Tax Returns. The Company has paid on a timely basis all
taxes that were due and payable. The unpaid taxes of the Company for tax periods
through the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date do not exceed the accruals and

prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service or determination letters have not
been submitted for those Employee Benefit Plans as to which the Internal Revenue

Benefit Plan has been amended or operated since the date of its most recent
determination letter or application therefor in any respect, and no act or
omission has occurred, that would adversely affect its qualification or

ERISA Affiliate to (i) any material fine, penalty, tax or liability of any kind
imposed under ERISA or the Code or (ii) any material contractual indemnification
or contribution obligation protecting any fiduciary, insurer or service provider
with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan.

               (i)  No Employee Benefit Plan is funded by, associated with or
related to a "voluntary employee's beneficiary association" within the meaning

unilaterally by the Company at any time without material liability to the
Company as a result thereof and no Employee Benefit Plan, plan documentation or

Code; and (iii) agreement or plan binding the Company or any Subsidiary,

of the state of its incorporation.  The Buyer is duly qualified to conduct
business and is in corporate good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction
in which the nature of its businesses or the ownership or leasing of its
properties requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below).  The Buyer has all requisite corporate power and authority to
carry on the businesses in which it is engaged and to own and use the properties
owned and used by it. The Buyer is not in default under or in violation of any
provision of its Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, each as amended or

taken as a whole.

Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Buyer and
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Buyer, enforceable against it
in accordance with its terms.

     3.3.      Noncontravention.  Subject to compliance with the applicable
               ----------------
requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws, and
the Exchange Act, neither the execution and delivery by the Buyer of this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, nor the consummation by the Buyer of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, will (a) conflict with or violate
any provision of the charter or By-laws of the Buyer, (b) require on the part of
the Buyer any filing with, or permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any
Governmental Entity, (c) conflict with, result in a material breach of,
constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a material

party any right to terminate, modify or cancel, or require any notice, consent
or waiver under, any contract or instrument to which the Buyer or the subsidiary
is a party or by which either is bound or to which any of their assets are
subject, or (d) violate any order, writ,

                                     -20-

injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Buyer or any
of its properties or assets.

     3.4.      Brokers' Fees.  The Buyer has no liability or obligation to pay

the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC"), and (b) all other reports filed by the Buyer under
Section 13 or subsections (a) or (c) of Section 14 of the Exchange Act with the
SEC since February 12, 1999 (such reports are collectively referred to herein as
the "Buyer SEC Reports"). The audited financial statements and unaudited interim
financial statements of the Buyer included in the Buyer SEC Reports, as of their
respective dates, (a) complied as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, (b) were prepared in accordance with generally

                                INDEMNIFICATION

     4.1.      Indemnification by the Company Stockholder.  The Company
               ------------------------------------------
Stockholder (also referred to herein as the "Indemnifying Stockholder") shall
indemnify the Buyer in respect of, and hold it harmless against, any and all
debts, obligations and other liabilities (whether absolute, accrued, contingent,
fixed or otherwise, or whether known or unknown, or due or to become due or
otherwise), monetary damages, fines, fees, penalties, interest obligations,
deficiencies, losses and expenses (including without limitation amounts paid in
settlement, interest, court costs, costs of investigators, fees and expenses of
attorneys, accountants, financial advisors and other experts, and other expenses
of litigation) ("Damages") incurred or suffered by the Buyer or any Affiliate
thereof resulting from, relating to or constituting:

                                     -21-
<PAGE>

               (a)  any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement of the Company or the Company Stockholder
contained in this Agreement;

               (b)  any failure of the Company Stockholder to have good, valid
and marketable title to the issued and outstanding Company Shares issued in the
name of the Company Stockholder, free and clear of all Security Interests; or

               (c)  any claim by a stockholder or former stockholder of the

Indemnifying Stockholder in respect of, and hold him harmless against, any and

<PAGE>

     4.3.      Indemnification Claims.
               ----------------------
               (a)  A party entitled, or seeking to assert rights, to
indemnification under this Article IV (an "Indemnified Party") shall give
written notification to the party from whom indemnification is sought (an
"Indemnifying Party") of the commencement of any suit or proceeding relating to
a third party claim for which indemnification pursuant to this Article IV may be
sought. Such notification shall be given within 20 business days after receipt
by the Indemnified Party of notice of such suit or proceeding, and shall
describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Indemnified Party) the
facts constituting the basis for such suit or proceeding and the amount of the
claimed damages; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified
Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party
of any liability or obligation hereunder except to the extent of any damage or
liability caused by or arising out of such failure. Within 20 days after
delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice
thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such suit or
proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;
provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party may only assume control of such defense
if (A) it acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that any damages,
fines, costs or other liabilities that may be assessed against the Indemnified
Party in connection with such suit or proceeding constitute Damages for which
the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified pursuant to this Article IV and (B)
the ad damnum is less than or equal to the amount of Damages for which the
Indemnifying Party is liable under this Article IV and (ii) the Indemnifying
Party may not assume control of the defense of a suit or proceeding involving
criminal liability or in which equitable relief is sought against the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not so assume control of such
defense, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The party not
controlling such defense (the "Non-controlling Party") may participate therein
at its own expense; provided that if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of
such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests or
different defenses available with respect to such suit or proceeding, the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party shall be
considered "Damages" for purposes of this Agreement. The party controlling such
defense (the "Controlling Party") shall keep the Non-controlling Party advised
of the status of such suit or proceeding and the defense thereof and shall
consider in good faith recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with
respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling Party
with such information as it may have with respect to such suit or proceeding
(including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have
been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or
other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise cooperate
with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such suit or proceeding.
The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any such suit or proceeding without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from, any such suit or proceeding without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

                                     -23-
<PAGE>

          (b)  In order to seek indemnification under this Article IV, an
Indemnified Party shall give written notification (a "Claim Notice") to the
Indemnifying Party which contains (i) a description and the amount (the "Claimed
Amount") of any Damages incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the
Indemnified Party, (ii) a statement that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this Article IV for such Damages and a reasonable
explanation of the basis therefor, and (iii) a demand for payment (in the manner
provided in paragraph (c) below) in the amount of such Damages. If the
Indemnified Party is seeking to enforce such claim pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver a copy of the Claim Notice to
the Escrow Agent. Any Claim Notice issued by or on behalf of the Buyer must be
issued on or before 365 days following the Closing Date.

          (c)  Within 20 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying
Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response (the "Response")
in which the Indemnifying Party shall: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which case the Response shall
be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
of the Claimed Amount, by check or by wire transfer), (ii) agree that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the Claimed
Amount (the "Agreed Amount") (in which case the Response shall be accompanied by
a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Agreed
Amount, by check or by wire transfer), or (iii) dispute that the Indemnified
Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount. If the Indemnifying
Party in the Response disputes its liability for all or part of the Claimed
Amount, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall follow the
procedures set forth in Section 4.3(d) for the resolution of such dispute (a
"Dispute").

          (d)  During the 60-day period following the delivery of a Response
that reflects a Dispute, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
use good faith efforts to resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute is not resolved
within such 60-day period, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall discuss in good faith the submission of the Dispute to a mutually
acceptable alternative dispute resolution procedure (which may be non-binding or
binding upon the parties, as they agree in advance) (the "ADR Procedure"). In
the event the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party agree upon an ADR
Procedure, such parties shall, in consultation with the chosen dispute
resolution service (the "ADR Service"), promptly agree upon a format and
timetable for the ADR Procedure, agree upon the rules applicable to the ADR
Procedure, and promptly undertake the ADR Procedure. The provisions of this
Section 4.3(d) shall not obligate the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party to pursue an ADR Procedure or prevent either such party from pursuing the
Dispute in a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that, if the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party agree to pursue an ADR Procedure, neither the
Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party may commence litigation or seek
other remedies with respect to the Dispute prior to the completion of such ADR
Procedure. Any ADR Procedure undertaken by the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall be considered a compromise negotiation for purposes of
federal and state rules of evidence, and all statements, offers, opinions and
disclosures (whether written or oral) made in the course of the ADR Procedure by
or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party

                                     -24-
<PAGE>

or the ADR Service shall be treated as confidential and, where appropriate, as
privileged work product. Such statements, offers, opinions and disclosures shall
not be discoverable or admissible for any purposes in any litigation or other
proceeding relating to the Dispute (provided that this sentence shall not be
construed to exclude from discovery or admission any matter that is otherwise
discoverable or admissible). The fees and expenses of any ADR Service used by
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall be shared equally by the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party.

          (e)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 4.3, if a
third party asserts (other than by means of a lawsuit) that an Indemnified Party
is liable to such third party for a monetary or other obligation which may
constitute or result in Damages for which such Indemnified Party may be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Article IV, and such Indemnified Party
reasonably determines that it has a valid business reason to fulfill such
obligation without prior notice to the Indemnifying Party, then (i) such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to satisfy such obligation, without prior
notice to or consent from the Indemnifying Party, (ii) such Indemnified Party
may subsequently make a claim for indemnification in accordance with the
provisions of this Article IV, and (iii) such Indemnified Party shall be
reimbursed, in accordance with the provisions of this Article IV, for any such
Damages for which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article IV
(subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute the Indemnified
Party's entitlement to indemnification, or the amount for which it is entitled
to indemnification, under the terms of this Article IV).

     4.4. Survival of Representations and Warranties.  All representations and
          ------------------------------------------
warranties contained in this Agreement, shall survive the Closing and any
investigation at any time made by or on behalf of an Indemnified Party and,
other than the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.2, 2.5,
2.9 and 2.21, shall expire on the date one year following the Closing Date.  The
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.9 and 2.21 shall survive
until 30 days following expiration of all statutes of limitation applicable to
the matters referred to therein. The representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 2.2 and 2.5 shall survive indefinitely. If an Indemnified Party
delivers to an Indemnifying Party, before expiration of a representation or
warranty, either a Claim Notice based upon a breach of such representation or
warranty stating the nature of the breach of the representation or warranty in
reasonable detail, or a notice that, as a result a legal proceeding instituted
by or written claim made by a third party, the Indemnified Party reasonably
expects to incur Damages as a result of a breach of such representation or
warranty (an "Expected Claim Notice"), then such representation or warranty
shall survive until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of the matter
covered by such notice.  If the legal proceeding or written claim with respect
to which an Expected Claim Notice has been given is definitively withdrawn or
resolved in favor of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
so notify the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding to the contrary contained
herein, all representations and warranties contained in this Agreement which are
based on fraud (as determined by final judgment by a Governmental Authority
having valid jurisdiction) by the Company Stockholder or the Buyer shall survive
until finally resolved and satisfied in full.

<PAGE>

     4.5.  Limitations.
           -----------

           (a)  The parties hereto agree that materiality qualifications
contained in the representations and warranties in this Agreement ("Qualified
Representations") shall only be considered for purposes of determining whether
any such representation or warranty has been breached and in the event that a
Qualified Representation has been breached, the fact that such representation or
warranty was so qualified will not affect the calculation of an Indemnified
Party's Damages.

           (b)  Except with respect to claims based on fraud, after the Closing,
the rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Article IV shall be the
exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties with respect to claims resulting
from or relating to any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement.

           (c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but
subject to the other limitations on liability and procedures contained in this
Article IV, the Buyer shall have no right to indemnity from the Company
Stockholder under this Article IV unless and until the amount of Buyer's Damages
exceed in the aggregate the sum of $125,000, in which event the Company
Stockholder shall be liable for all such Buyer Damages, including the first
$125,000 of such damages; provided, further, that, except with respect to any
Buyer's Damages as a result of a breach of Section 2.2, the Company Stockholder
shall be liable for a maximum of $4,500,000 of Buyer's Damages; and, provided
further, that the Company Stockholder shall satisfy Buyer's Damages for any
Claim made within one year of the Closing Date, first, by forfeiture of the
Acquisition Escrow Shares, second by delivering shares of Buyer Common Stock
(the "Indemnification Shares") and third by delivery of cash or such other
consideration that the Buyer and the Company Stockholder may mutually agree
upon. The number of shares of Buyer Common Stock which shall constitute
Indemnification Shares shall equal 59,618 and for the purposes of this Article
IV, the parties agree that notwithstanding the fair market value of such shares,
such shares shall be deemed to have a value of $26.8375 per share.

           (d)  All indemnification by the Company Stockholder hereunder (to the
extent not satisfied in the manner specified in the preceding sentence) shall be
effected by payment of cash or delivery of a cashier's or certified check in the
amount of the indemnification liability.

           (e)  The Company Stockholder shall not have any right of contribution
against the Company with respect to any breach by the Company of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements.

           (f)  The parties agree that any indemnification payments made
pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for tax purposes as an adjustment to
the Aggregate Consideration, unless otherwise required by applicable law.

                                     -26-
<PAGE>

          (g)  Each Indemnified Party shall be obligated in connection with any
claim for indemnification under this Article IV to use all reasonable efforts to
mitigate Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to such Damages; provided that the amount of
any Damages for which indemnification is provided under this Article IV shall be
computed net of any insurance proceeds actually received by the Buyer in
connection with such Damages.

          (h)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
neither the Company Stockholder nor any Affiliate of Company Stockholder or the
Buyer shall be liable for any consequential, punitive or special damages
pursuant to this Agreement or any of the agreements contemplated hereby, except
with respect to intentional, willful or bad faith breaches hereof.

                                ESCROW PROPERTY

     5.1. Business Continuity Escrow Property.
          -----------------------------------

          (a)  The Business Continuity Escrow Property delivered to the Escrow
Agent pursuant to Section 1.7 of this Agreement is intended to secure the
successful continuation of the business of the Company for a period of two years

          (b)  The Company Stockholder shall be entitled to receive on (x) the
first anniversary of the Closing, 50% of the Business Continuity Escrow
Property, which shall include the entire cash portion of such escrow property
and (y), on the second anniversary of the Closing, the remainder of the Business
Continuity Escrow Property; provided, in each such case, that subject to
paragraph 5.1(c), the Company Stockholder and at least five of the Key Employees
listed on Schedule I hereto have served as employees of the Buyer through each
          ----------
such anniversary.

          (c)  If the Company Stockholder's employment with the Buyer is
terminated by the Buyer without Cause (as defined below), by the Company
Stockholder for Good Reason (as defined below) or by reason of death or
disability (as defined below), the Business Continuity Escrow Property then held
in escrow and not subject to a claim shall be released to the Company
Stockholder or his estate, as the case may be; provided that the Company
Stockholder is not in material breach of the Employment Agreement attached
hereto as Exhibit B or the Standard Employee Agreement attached hereto as
          ---------
Exhibit C to which the Company Stockholder is party; provided that in each such
- ---------
case any notice and cure period shall apply.

          (d)  For purposes of this Section 5, "Cause" shall mean (a) a good
faith finding by the Buyer that (i) the Company Stockholder has failed to
perform his assigned duties for the Buyer which failure has continued for a
period of two weeks following notice of such claim by an officer of the Buyer or
(ii) the Company Stockholder has engaged in dishonesty, gross negligence or
misconduct, or (b) the conviction of the

                                     -27-
<PAGE>

Company Stockholder of, or the entry of a pleading of guilty or nolo contendere
by the Company Stockholder to, any felony other than motor vehicle offenses or
other offenses which do not have a material impact on the Company Stockholder's
ability to perform his duties as an employee of the Buyer. For purposes of this
Section 5, "Good Reason" shall mean (a) a reduction in the Company Stockholder's
base compensation, (b) the imposition of a requirement by the Buyer, any person
in control of the Buyer or any successor to the Buyer, that the location at
which the Company Stockholder performs his principal duties for the Buyer or any
successor to the Buyer be changed to a new location outside a radius of 75 miles
from the then current location or (c) a reduction in the responsibilities of the
Company Stockholder while employed by the Buyer, any person in control of the
Buyer or any successor to the Buyer, such that the responsibilities of the
Company Stockholder are inconsistent with the nature of the responsibilities of
other employees of similar stature and compensation (i.e., vice president level)
of the Buyer, any person in control of the Buyer or any successor to the Buyer.
For purposes of this Section 5, "Disability" shall mean the inability of the
Company Stockholder, due to a physical or mental disability, for a period of 90
days, whether or not consecutive, during any 360-day period to perform the
services contemplated under this Agreement, with or without reasonable
accommodation as that term is defined under state or federal law. A
determination of disability shall be made by a physician satisfactory to both
the Company Stockholder and the Buyer, provided that if the Company Stockholder
and the Buyer do not agree on a physician, the Company Stockholder and the Buyer
shall each select a physician and these two together shall select a third
physician, whose determination as to disability shall be binding on all parties.

     5.2.  Non-Competition Escrow Shares.
           -----------------------------

           (a)  The Non-Competition Escrow Shares escrowed with the Escrow Agent
pursuant to Section 1.7 of this Agreement shall secure the covenants set forth
in the form of Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement by each Key
Employee attached hereto as Exhibit C against engaging in any business
                            ---------
competitive with the Buyer or the Company following the Closing Date. Each Key
Employee shall be entitled to receive one half of the aggregate number of Non-
Competition Escrow Shares set forth opposite his or her names on Schedule I
                                                                 ----------
attached hereto which have been placed in escrow with the Escrow Agent on each
of the first and second anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, that the Key
Employee is not in breach of the Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement
attached hereto as Exhibit C or the Standard Employee Agreement attached hereto
                   ---------
as Exhibit D to which each such Key Employee is party.
   ---------

           (b)  On or about each of the first and second anniversary of the
Closing, the Buyer shall use its best efforts to register with the SEC for
resale to the public by the respective Key Employees on Form S-3 (each a "Buyer
Registration Statement") under the Securities Act the aggregate number of Non-
Competition Escrow Shares which are then released from escrow to the Key
Employees; provided that the Buyer may, by written notice to the Key Employees,
(i) delay the filing or effectiveness of a Buyer Registration Statement or (ii)
suspend a Buyer Registration Statement after effectiveness and require that the
Key Employees immediately cease sales of shares pursuant to a Buyer Registration
Statement, in each case, in the event that (A) the Buyer is in

                                     -28-
<PAGE>

registration under a registration statement (other than a registration statement
on Form S-8 or its successor form) with the SEC for a public offering of its
securities or (B) the Buyer is engaged in any activity or transaction or
preparations or negotiations for any activity or transaction that the Buyer
desires to keep confidential for business reasons, if the Buyer determines in

whom it is intended.  Any Party may change the address to which notices,
requests, demands, claims, and other communications hereunder are to be
delivered by giving the other Parties notice in the manner herein set forth.

     7.8.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
           -------------
accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without

           ----------------------
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by all

           ------------
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to limit the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and

                                     -32-

that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.

            --------------------------
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Boston, Massachusetts in
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (b)
agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in any such court, and (c) agrees not to bring any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court.
Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other Party with respect thereto.  Any
Party may make service on another Party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the Party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for
the giving of notices in Section 6.7.  Nothing in this Section 6.11, however,
shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law.

transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the Buyer shall pay
the fees of the Escrow Agent (excluding any fees and costs incurred as a result
of litigation thereof).

            ------------------------

foregoing, the Buyer will assume all costs associated with reasonable efforts to

contemplated by this Agreement to commence participation in the Buyer's 401(k)
Plan, effective September 1, 2000, provided such participants return properly
completed enrollment forms to Buyer's designee prior to September 1, 2000.  In
addition, Buyer shall take any all actions necessary to provide full service
credit to the Company Shareholder and former employees of the Company
immediately upon participation in the Buyer's 401(k) Plan for the purposes of
eligibility and vesting under the Buyer's 401(k) Plan for the service the
employees of the Company and the Company Shareholder performed for the Company.
Buyer shall also take any and all actions necessary to permit former
participants in the Flashpoint 401(k) Plan and the Company Shareholder to roll-
over their account balances in and loans under the Flashpoint Plan to the
Buyer's 401(k) Plan.

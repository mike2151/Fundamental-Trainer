  Part III of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by
reference from the Company's definitive Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting
of Stockholders to be held on May 18, 1999.
 
                             CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS
 
  This Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"). All statements regarding the Company's expected future
financial position, results of operations, cash flows, funds from operations,
dividends and dividend plans, financing plans, business strategy, budgets,
projected costs, capital expenditures, competitive positions, growth
opportunities, expected lease income, ability to qualify as a real estate
investment trust, plans and objectives of management for future operations and
statements that include words such as "anticipate," "believe," "plan,"
"estimate," "expect," "intend," and other similar expressions are forward-
looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain,
and stockholders must recognize that actual results may differ from the
Company's expectations. Forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K
relating to the operations of a partnership or limited liability company,
including the Company's realty partnership, are not forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act or Section 21E of the
Exchange Act.
 
  Actual future results and trends for the Company may differ materially
depending on a variety of factors discussed in this "Cautionary Statements"
section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including, without limitation, the
"Business--Risk Factors" section. Factors that may affect the plans or results
of the Company include, without limitation, (i) the ability of the Company's
operators to maintain the financial strength and liquidity necessary to
satisfy their obligations and duties under leases and other agreements with
the Company, (ii) success in implementing its business strategy, (iii) the
nature and extent of future competition, (iv) the extent of future healthcare
reform and regulation, including cost containment measures and changes in
reimbursement policies and procedures, (v) increases in the cost of borrowing
for the Company, (vi) the ability of the Company's operators to deliver high
quality care and to attract patients, (vii) the Company's ability to acquire
additional properties, (viii) changes in the general economic conditions
and/or in the markets in which the Company may, from time to time, compete,
(ix) the ability of the Company to pay and/or refinance its indebtedness as it
becomes due, and (x) the ability of the Company and the Company's operators
and other third parties to replace, modify or upgrade computer systems in ways
that adequately address the Year 2000 issue. Many of such factors are beyond
the control of the Company and its management.
 
  In addition, please note that certain information contained in this Form 10-
K has been provided by the Company's primary tenant, Vencor, Inc. ("Vencor").
Vencor is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") and is required to file with the Commission
annual reports containing audited financial information and quarterly reports
containing unaudited financial information. Although Vencor has provided
certain information to the Company, the Company has not verified this
information either through an independent investigation or by reviewing
Vencor's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1998,
which as of March 30, 1999 had not been filed with the Commission. The Company
has no reason to believe that such information is inaccurate in any material
respects, but there can be no assurances that all such information is
accurate.

Item 1. Business
 
General
 
  Ventas, Inc. ("Ventas" or the "Company") is a real estate company that owns
or leases 45 hospitals (comprised of two acute care hospitals and 43 long-term
care hospitals), 219 nursing centers and eight personal care facilities as of
December 31, 1998. The Company's portfolio of properties are located in 36
states and are leased and operated primarily by Vencor or its subsidiaries.
The Company conducts all of its business through a wholly owned operating
partnership, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership. The Company has announced its
intention to operate and be treated as a self-administered, self-managed real
estate investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes beginning
January 1, 1999.
 
  The Company was incorporated in Kentucky in 1983 as Vencare, Inc. and
commenced operations in 1985. It was reorganized as a Delaware corporation in
1987 and changed its name to Vencor, Incorporated in 1989 and to Vencor, Inc.
in 1993. On September 28, 1995, The Hillhaven Corporation merged with and into
the Company. On March 21, 1997, the Company acquired TheraTx, Incorporated, a
provider of subacute rehabilitation and respiratory therapy program management
services to nursing centers and an operator of 26 nursing centers. On June 24,
1997, the Company acquired Transitional Hospitals Corporation, an operator of
16 long-term acute care hospitals and three satellite facilities located in 13
states.
 
  On May 1, 1998, the Company effected a reorganization (the "Reorganization")
pursuant to which the Company was separated into two publicly held
corporations. A new corporation, subsequently renamed Vencor, Inc., was formed
to operate the hospital, nursing center and ancillary services businesses.
Pursuant to the terms of the Reorganization, the Company distributed the
common stock of Vencor to stockholders of record of the Company as of April
27, 1998. The Company, through its subsidiaries, continued to hold title to
substantially all of the real property and to lease such real property to
Vencor. At such time, the Company also changed its name to Ventas, Inc. and
refinanced substantially all of its long-term debt. For financial reporting
periods subsequent to the Reorganization, the historical financial statements
of the Company were assumed by Vencor, and the Company is deemed to have
commenced operations on May 1, 1998. Accordingly, the Company does not have
comparable financial results for prior periods. In addition, for certain
reporting purposes under this Form 10-K and other filings, the Commission
treats the Company as having commenced operations on May 1, 1998.
 
  The Company's principal objectives are to maximize funds from operations for
distribution to stockholders, to enhance capital growth through the
appreciation of the residual value of its portfolio of properties, and to
preserve and maintain the stockholders' capital. The Company is currently
invested in high quality healthcare related facilities including hospitals,
nursing centers and personal care facilities whose principal tenants are
healthcare related companies. If financial conditions warrant, the Company may
make additional investments in the form of operating leases or permanent
mortgage financing and may seek to reduce its tenant concentration with
Vencor. Any such acquired facilities will be leased to and operated by
experienced and qualified third party operators. The Company also may consider
opportunities in non-healthcare related properties.
 
  The Company's evaluation of potential investments will include such factors
as (i) the quality and experience of the operator; (ii) the financial status
of the tenant/mortgagor and any guarantor; (iii) the geographic area, type of
property, and demographic profile; (iv) the construction quality, condition
and design of the improvements; (v) the current and anticipated cash flows and
its ability to meet operational needs and lease obligations and to provide a
competitive investment return to the Company's stockholders; (vi) the
potential for appreciation in the residual value of the property; (vii) the
growth, tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property
is located; (viii) occupancy and demand for similar healthcare facilities in
the same or nearby communities; (ix) adequate mix of private, Medicare and
Medicaid patients; (x) potential alternative uses of the property; (xi) the
sources of patient referrals for the facility; and (xii) prospects for
 
                                       4
<PAGE>
 
liquidity through financing or refinancing. The Company will also closely
evaluate the value of the property, the cost of the Company's capital needed
to acquire the property and the anticipated return thereon.
 
Recent Developments
 
  On January 26, 1999, Vencor announced that it expected earnings for the
fourth quarter, exclusive of unusual transactions, to be substantially lower
than the third quarter of 1998. Vencor had reported a loss of $0.02 per share
for the third quarter ended September 30, 1998, excluding the effect of
unusual transactions and a change in the effective tax rate. Vencor also
announced that it expected 1998 results to be impacted adversely by certain
recurring year-end adjustments, the most significant of which relates to an
increase in the provision for bad debts for its nursing center and ancillary
service businesses which could aggregate approximately $20 million.
Adjustments to other accruals, as well as balance sheet adjustments related to
the Hillhaven, TheraTx and Transitional mergers were also expected to impact
negatively fourth quarter results.
 
  In addition, Vencor disclosed that certain additional adjustments may be
recorded in connection with asset valuations in the fourth quarter, including
a write-down of its investment in a nursing center in Wisconsin and a
previously announced write-down of its investment in Behavioral Healthcare
Corporation. Vencor indicated that it also was reviewing the expected
recoverability of recorded amounts of goodwill and deferred tax assets at
year-end and may record a fourth quarter charge based on the results of the
review.
 
  Vencor also announced that it may be required to renegotiate its bank credit
facility since the foregoing operating results and adjustments may result in
certain covenant violations. Vencor stated that it was in discussions with its
lead banks and anticipated that it would successfully conclude its
negotiations prior to releasing its financial results for 1998. Vencor
announced that its was in default of certain covenants, but that it has
received a waiver of those covenants contained in its bank credit facility
until March 31, 1999.
 
  The Company and Vencor have discussed Vencor's recent results of operations
and Vencor's need to amend or restructure its existing indebtedness. In those
discussions, Vencor has requested interim rent concessions under the Master
Lease Agreements and the Company has rejected that request. The Company will
consider appropriate action to take in response to any further proposals by
Vencor as may be in the best interests of the Company. The Company has entered
into an agreement with Vencor whereby the Company has agreed not to exercise
remedies for non-payment of rent, which is due from Vencor on April 1, 1999,
for a period ending on April 12, 1999. During the Company's discussions with
Vencor, Vencor has asserted various potential claims against the Company
arising out of the Reorganization. The Company intends to vigorously defend
these claims if they are asserted in a legal or mediation proceeding.
 
  As a result of the recent announcements by Vencor and similar industry-wide
factors, the Company has suspended the implementation of its original business
strategy. Instead, management is reviewing the possible financial impact on
the Company of the recent announcements by Vencor. In particular, the Company
is reviewing Vencor's financial condition and ability to comply with the
covenants in its bank credit facility. The Company has retained Merrill, Lynch
& Co., as financial advisor, to assist it in this review. In addition, the
Company, together with Merrill Lynch & Co., is reviewing alternatives to repay
the $275 million portion of its credit facility that matures on October 30,
1999. These alternatives include obtaining the necessary proceeds to pay down
or refinance the $275 million loan through cash flows from operations,
available borrowings under the Company's credit facility, the issuance of
public or private debt or equity and asset sales, or a combination of the
foregoing.
 
  In connection with the Reorganization, an Independent Committee of the Board
of Directors was formed. The function of the Independent Committee is to
review and approve all agreements and transactions between the Company and
Vencor to ensure that such agreements and transactions represent arm's length
negotiations including, without limitation, the negotiation, enforcement and
renegotiations of any leases between the Company and Vencor. On November 17,
1998, the Company appointed Douglas Crocker II as an independent director of
the Company and as Chairman of the Independent Committee. In addition, the
Company has undertaken other initiatives to alleviate the potential conflict
of interest between the Company and Vencor. On September 21, 1998, the Company
hired Steven T. Downey as Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Downey was not
 
                                       5
<PAGE>
 
previously employed by Vencor. Effective March 5, 1999, the Company accepted
the resignation of Thomas T. Ladt as President, Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Operating Officer and as a director of the Company. The Company
appointed Debra A. Cafaro as President and Chief Executive Officer and as a
director. Ms. Cafaro had previously served as president and a director of
Ambassador Apartments, Inc., a public real estate investment trust, from April
1997 to May 1998. W. Bruce Lunsford and R. Gene Smith, each directors of the
Company, have resigned as directors of Vencor. As of the date hereof, the
Company and Vencor have no common directors or officers.
 
  As described below under "--Relationship with Vencor," Vencor provided the
Company with certain administrative services after the Reorganization. The
Company has recently moved its offices from space it shared with Vencor and is
in the process of assembling the resources necessary so that it no longer
requires administrative support from Vencor. However, as discussed below,
Vencor has agreed to assist in the preparation of certain tax returns for the
Company and to defend certain litigation to which the Company is or may become
a party.
 
  Vencor is subject to the reporting requirements of the Commission and is
required to file with the Commission annual reports containing audited
financial information and quarterly reports containing unaudited financial
information. The information related to Vencor provided in this Form 10-K is
derived from filings made with the Commission or other publicly available
information. The Company is providing this data for informational purposes
only, and the reader of this Form 10-K is encouraged to obtain Vencor's
publicly available filings from the Commission. The Company has no reason to
believe that the information is inaccurate in any material respects, but the
Company has not independently verified such information and there can be no
assurances that all such information is accurate. As of March 30, 1999, Vencor
had not released financial results for 1998 or filed its Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 1998.
 
Relationship with Vencor
 
  The Company leases all of its hospitals and 210 of its nursing centers to
Vencor under four Master Lease Agreements. For the eight months ended December
31, 1998, Vencor accounted for approximately 98.7% of the Company's revenues.
 
  In order to govern certain of the relationships between the Company and
Vencor after the Reorganization and to provide mechanisms for an orderly
transition, the Company and Vencor entered into various agreements at the time
of the Reorganization. The Company believes that the agreements contain terms
which generally are comparable to those which would have been reached in arm's
length negotiations with unaffiliated parties. The most significant terms of
the Master Lease Agreements and other related agreements are described below.
The reader is also strongly encouraged to review and consider the factors
described in "Business--Risk Factors."
 
 Master Lease Agreements
 
  In the Reorganization, the Company retained substantially all of its real
property, buildings and other improvements (primarily long-term care hospitals
and nursing centers) and leased these facilities to Vencor under four Master
Lease Agreements. Such Master Lease Agreements contain terms which govern the
rights, duties and responsibilities of the Company and Vencor relative to each
of the leased properties. The leased properties include land, buildings,
structures, easements, improvements on the land and permanently affixed
equipment, machinery and other fixtures relating to the operation of the
facilities.
 
  The Master Leases are structured as triple-net leases pursuant to which
Vencor is required to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance
related to the properties. The base annual rent is approximately $221.5
million, plus a 2% per annum escalator, which escalator is contingent upon
Vencor achieving net patient service
revenue for the applicable year in excess of 75% of net patient service
revenue for the base year of 1997. The initial terms of these leases were for
periods ranging from 10 to 15 years.
 
  Except as noted below, upon the occurrence of an event of default under a
Master Lease, the Company may, at its option, exercise the remedies under a
Master Lease on all properties included within that particular
 
                                       6
<PAGE>
 
Master Lease. The remedies which may be exercised under the Master Lease by
the Company, at its option, include the following: (i) after not less than 10
days' notice to Vencor, terminate the Master Lease, repossess the leased
property and relet the leased property to a third party and require that
Vencor pay to the Company, as liquidated damages, the net present value of the
rent for the balance of the term, discounted at the prime rate; (ii) without
terminating the Master Lease, repossess the leased property and relet the
leased property with Vencor remaining liable under the Master Lease for all
obligations to be performed by Vencor thereunder, including the difference, if
any, between the rent under the Master Lease and the rent payable as a result
of the reletting of the leased property; (iii) demand that Vencor purchase
either the property which is the subject of the default or all of the
properties included within that Master Lease, at the Company's option, for the
higher of the fair market value or the minimum repurchase price, both as
defined in the Master Lease; and (iv) any and all other rights and remedies
available at law or in equity. The Master Leases require Vencor to cooperate
with the Company in connection with license transfers and certain other
regulatory matters arising from a lease termination.
 
  Each Master Lease provides that the remedies under such Master Lease may be
exercised with respect only to the property that is the subject of the default
upon the occurrence of any one of the following events of default: (i) the
occurrence of a final non-appealable revocation of Vencor's license to operate
a facility; (ii) the revocation of certification of a facility for
reimbursement under Medicare; or (iii) Vencor becomes subject to regulatory
sanctions at a facility and fails to cure the regulatory sanctions within the
applicable cure period. Upon the occurrence of the fifth such event of default
under a Master Lease with respect to any one or more properties, the Master
Lease permits the Company, at its option, to exercise the rights and remedies
under the Master Lease on all properties included within that Master Lease.
 
  The occurrence of any one of the following events of default constitute an
event of default under all Master Leases permitting the Company, at its
option, to exercise the rights and remedies under all of the Master Leases
simultaneously: (i) the occurrence of an event of default under the Agreement
of Indemnity--Third Party Leases between the Company and Vencor, (ii) the
liquidation or dissolution of Vencor, (iii) if Vencor files a petition of
bankruptcy or a petition for reorganization or arrangement under the federal
bankruptcy laws, and (iv) a petition is filed against Vencor under federal
bankruptcy laws and same is not dismissed within 90 days of its institution.
 
  Any notice of the occurrence of an event of default under a Master Lease
which the Company sends to Vencor must be sent simultaneously to Vencor's
leasehold mortgagee (the "Leasehold Mortgagee"). Prior to terminating a Master
Lease for all or any part of the leased property covered thereunder, the
Company must give the Leasehold Mortgagee 30 days prior written notice and the
opportunity to cure any such event of default. Following the expiration of
such cure period, the Company may then terminate a Master Lease by giving at
least 10 days prior written notice of such termination.
 
  Vencor may, with the prior written approval of the Company, sell, assign or
sublet its interest in all or any portion of the leased property under a
Master Lease. The Company may not unreasonably withhold its approval to any
such transfer provided (i) the assignee is creditworthy, (ii) the assignee has
at least four years of operational experience, (iii) the assignee has a
favorable business and operational reputation, (iv) the assignee assumes the
Master Lease in writing, (v) the sublease is subject and subordinate to the
terms of the Master Lease, and (vi) Vencor and any guarantor remains primarily
liable under the Master Lease.
 
  Each Master Lease requires Vencor to maintain liability, all risk property
and workers' compensation insurance for the properties at a level reasonable
with respect to the properties. Each Master Lease further provides that in the
event a property is totally destroyed, or is substantially destroyed such that
the damage renders the property unsuitable for its intended use, Vencor will
have the option either to restore the property at its cost to its pre-
destruction condition or offer to purchase the leased property (in either
event all insurance
 
                                       7
<PAGE>
 
proceeds, net of administrative and related costs, will be made available to
Vencor). If the Company rejects the offer to purchase, Vencor will have the
option either to restore the property or terminate the applicable Master Lease
with respect to the property. If the damage is such that the property is not
rendered unsuitable for its intended use, or if it is not covered by
insurance, each Master Lease requires Vencor to restore the property to its
original condition.
 
  Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of April 30,
1998, all controversies, claims or disputes arising out of the Master Leases
shall be subject to mediation between the parties for a reasonable period of
time in an effort to settle such dispute. If the parties are unable to reach
resolution after such period of time, then the dispute shall then be submitted
to arbitration.
 
 Development Agreement
 
  Under the terms of the Development Agreement, Vencor, if it so desires, will
complete the construction of certain development properties substantially in
accordance with the existing plans and specifications for each such property.
Upon completion of each such development property, the Company has the option
to purchase the development property from Vencor at a purchase price equal to
the amount of Vencor's actual costs in acquiring and developing such
development property prior to the purchase date. If the Company purchases the
development property, Vencor will lease the development property from the
Company. The initial annual base rent under such a lease will be 10% of the
actual costs incurred by Vencor in acquiring and developing the development
property. The other terms of the lease for the development property will be
substantially similar to those set forth in the Master Leases. As of December
31, 1998, the Company had acquired one skilled nursing center under the
Development Agreement for $6.2 million and has entered into a separate lease
with Vencor with respect to such facility. The Development Agreement has a
five year term, and the Company and Vencor each have the right to terminate
the Development Agreement in the event of a change of control.
 
 Participation Agreement
 
  Under the terms and conditions of the Participation Agreement, Vencor has a
right of first offer to become the lessee of any real property acquired or
developed by the Company which is to be operated as a hospital, nursing center
or other healthcare facility, provided that Vencor and the Company can
negotiate a mutually satisfactory lease arrangement and provided that the
property is not leased by the Company to the existing operator of such
facility.
 
  The Participation Agreement also provides, subject to certain terms, that
the Company has a right of first offer to purchase or finance any healthcare
related real property that Vencor determines to sell or mortgage to a third
party, provided that Vencor and the Company can negotiate mutually
satisfactory terms for such purchase or mortgage. The Participation Agreement
has a three year term, and the Company and Vencor each have the right to
terminate the Participation Agreement in the event of a change of control.
 
 Tax Allocation Agreement
 
  The Tax Allocation Agreement provides that the Company will be liable for
taxes of the Company's consolidated group attributable to periods prior to the
Reorganization with respect to the portion of such taxes attributable to the
property held by the Company after the Reorganization, and Vencor will be
liable for such pre-distribution taxes with respect to the portion of such
taxes attributable to the property held by Vencor after the Reorganization.
The Tax Allocation Agreement further provides that the Company will be liable
for any taxes attributable to the Reorganization except that Vencor will be
liable for any such taxes to the extent that Vencor derives certain future tax
benefits as a result of the payment of such taxes. The Company and its
subsidiaries are liable for taxes payable with respect to periods after the
Reorganization that are attributable to the Company's operations, and Vencor
and its subsidiaries are liable for taxes payable with respect to periods
after the Reorganization that are attributable to Vencor's operations. If, in
connection with a tax audit or filing of an amended return, a taxing authority
adjusts the Company's or Vencor's tax liability with respect to taxes for
which the other party was liable under the Tax Allocation Agreement, such
other party would be liable for the resulting tax assessment or would be
entitled to the resulting tax refund.

 Agreement of Indemnity--Third Party Leases
 
  In connection with the Reorganization, the Company assigned its former third
party lease obligations as a tenant or as a guarantor of tenant obligations to
Vencor. The Company remains primarily liable on substantially all of the third
party lease obligations assigned to Vencor. Under the terms of the Agreement
of Indemnity--Third Party Leases, Vencor and its subsidiaries have agreed to
indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and against all claims against
the Company arising out of the third party lease obligations assigned by the
Company to Vencor. If Vencor is unable to satisfy the obligations under any
third party lease assigned by the Company to Vencor, then the Company will be
liable for the payment and performance of the obligations under any such third
party lease. These leases have remaining terms ranging from 1 to 63 years. The
total aggregate remaining minimum rental payments under these leases are
approximately $177.7 million. The annual minimum rental payments under these
leases for 1999 will be approximately $39.2 million. See Note 8 to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 Agreement of Indemnity--Third Party Contracts
 
  In connection with the Reorganization, the Company assigned its former third
party guaranty agreements to Vencor. The Company remains primarily liable on
substantially all of the third party guarantees assigned to Vencor. Under the
terms of the Agreement of Indemnity--Third Party Contracts, Vencor and its
subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and
against all claims against the Company arising out of the third party
guarantees assigned by the Company to Vencor. If Vencor is unable to satisfy
the obligations under any third party guaranty agreement assigned by the
Company to Vencor, then the Company will be liable for the payment and
performance of the obligations under any such agreement. These third party
guarantees were entered into in connection with certain acquisitions and
financing transactions. The total aggregate exposure under these guarantees is
approximately $45.9 million. Atria Communities, Inc. has also agreed to
indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and against all claims against
the Company arising out of one of the third party contracts, which has an
aggregate principal amount of approximately $35 million.
 
 Transition Services Agreement
 
  The Transition Services Agreement, which expired pursuant to its terms on
December 31, 1998, provided that Vencor would provide the Company with
transitional administrative and support services, including but not limited to
finance and accounting, human resources, risk management, legal, and
information systems support. The Company paid Vencor $1.6 million for the
eight months ended December 31, 1998 for services provided under the
Transition Services Agreement.
 
  After December 31, 1998, Vencor continued to provide the Company with
certain administrative and support services (primarily computer systems,
telephone networks, mail delivery and other office services). Effective March
15, 1999, the Company moved to new office space and those services are no
longer provided by Vencor. Vencor has also agreed to assist in the preparation
of certain tax returns and other tax filings to be made on behalf of the
Company for the period ending on or before December 31, 1998. There can be no
assurance that Vencor will continue to assist the Company in the preparation
of these tax documents or that the Company will be able to timely and
accurately complete such tax filings if Vencor should discontinue its
assistance, although the Company intends to take all actions necessary to
enable it do so.
 
 Assumption of Certain Operating Liabilities and Litigation
 
  In connection with the Reorganization, Vencor agreed to assume and to
indemnify the Company for any and all liabilities that may arise out of the
ownership or operation of the healthcare operations either before or after the
date of the Reorganization. The indemnification provided by Vencor also covers
losses, including costs and expenses, which may arise from any future claims
asserted against the Company based on these healthcare operations. In
addition, at the time of the Reorganization, Vencor agreed to assume the
defense, on behalf of the Company, of any claims that were pending at the time
of the Reorganization, and which arose out of the
 
                                       9
<PAGE>
 
ownership or operation of the healthcare operations. Vencor also agreed to
defend, on behalf of the Company, any claims asserted after the Reorganization
which arise out of the ownership and operation of the healthcare operations.
There can be no assurance that Vencor will have sufficient assets, income and
access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations incurred in
connection with the Reorganization. If Vencor is unable to satisfy the
obligations under these arrangements, then the Company will be liable for the
payment and performance of such obligations and will have to assume the
defense of such claims.
 
  Vencor maintains insurance for certain professional liability claims and
losses through a wholly owned captive insurance company that insures the first
$2 million of claims and losses. Losses in excess of $2 million are insured
through unrelated commercial insurance carriers.

(1) Based on the percentage of total rent paid to the Company for the eight
    months ended December 31, 1998.
(2) The Company has properties located in 36 states managed by seven different
    operators.
(3) One of the six operators is Vencor.
 
 Hospital Facilities
 
  The Company's hospitals generally are long-term care hospitals that serve
medically complex, chronically ill patients. The operator of these hospitals
has the capability to treat patients who suffer from multiple systemic
failures or conditions such as neurological disorders, head injuries, brain
stem and spinal cord trauma, cerebral vascular accidents, chemical brain
injuries, central nervous system disorders, developmental anomalies and
cardiopulmonary disorders. Chronic patients are often dependent on technology
for continued life support, such as mechanical ventilators, total parenternal
nutrition, respiration or cardiac monitors and dialysis machines. While these
patients suffer from conditions which require a high level of monitoring and
specialized care, they may not necessitate the continued services of an
intensive care unit. Due to their severe medical conditions, these patients
generally are not clinically appropriate for admission to a nursing center or
rehabilitation hospital.
 
 Nursing Center Facilities
 
  The Company's nursing centers generally are skilled nursing facilities. In
addition to the customary services provided by skilled nursing centers, the
operators of the Company's nursing centers typically provide rehabilitation
services, including physical, occupational and speech therapies. The majority
of patients in rehabilitation programs stay in a facility for eight weeks or
less.
 
 Personal Care Facilities
 
  The Company's personal care facilities serve persons with acquired or
traumatic brain injury. The operator of the personal care facilities provides
services including supported living services, neurorehabilitation,
neurobehavioral management and vocational programs.
 
Competition
 
  The Company competes for real property investments with healthcare
providers, other healthcare related REITs, real estate partnerships, banks,
insurance companies and other investors. Many of the Company's competitors are
significantly larger and have greater financial resources and lower cost of
capital than the Company. If the Company reinstates its original business
strategy, the Company's ability to compete successfully for real property
investments will be determined by numerous factors, including the ability of
the Company to identify suitable acquisition targets, the ability of the
Company to negotiate acceptable terms for any such acquisition, and the
availability and cost of capital.
 
  The operators of the Company's properties compete on a local and regional
basis with other healthcare operators. The ability of the Company's operators
to compete successfully for patients at the Company's facilities depends upon
several factors, including the quality of care at the facility, the
operational reputation of the operator, physician referral patterns, physical
appearance of the facilities, other competitive systems of healthcare delivery
within the community, population and demographics, and the financial condition
of the operator. Private, federal and state reimbursement programs and the
effect of other laws and regulations also may have a significant effect on the
Company's operators to compete successfully for patients for the properties.

Environmental Regulation
 
  Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property from
which there is a release or threatened release of hazardous or toxic
substances or an entity that arranges for the disposal or treatment of
hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal site may be held jointly and
severally liable for the cost of removal or remediation of certain hazardous
or toxic substances, that could be located on, in or under such property or
other affected property. Such laws and regulations often impose liability
whether or not the owner, operator or otherwise responsible party, knew of, or
caused the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of any
required remediation or removal of these substances could be substantial, and
the liability of a responsible party as to any property is generally not
limited under such laws and regulations and could exceed the property's value
and the aggregate assets of the liable party. The presence of these substances
or failure to remediate such substances properly also may adversely affect the
owner's ability to sell or rent the property, or to borrow using the property
as collateral. In connection with the ownership and leasing of the Company's
properties, the Company could be liable for these costs as well as certain
other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to person or properties
or natural resources. In addition, owners and operators of real property are
liable for the costs of complying with environmental, health, and safety laws,
ordinances, and regulations and can be subjected to penalties for failure to
comply. Such ongoing compliance costs and penalties for non-compliance can be
substantial. Changes to existing or the adoption of new environmental, health,
and safety laws, ordinances, and regulations could substantially increase an
owner or operator's environmental, health, and safety compliance costs and/or
associated liabilities. Environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances,
and regulations potentially affecting the Company address a wide variety of
topics, including, but not limited to, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls
("PCBs"), fuel oil management, wastewater discharges, air emissions,
radioactive materials, medical wastes, and hazardous wastes. Under the Master
Leases, Vencor has agreed to indemnify the Company against any environmental
claims (including penalties and clean up costs) resulting from any condition
arising in, on or under, or relating to, the leased properties at any time on
or after the commencement date of the applicable Master Lease. Vencor also has
agreed to indemnify the Company against any environmental claim (including
penalties and clean up costs) resulting from any condition permitted to
deteriorate, on or after the commencement date of the applicable Master Lease
(including as a result of migration from adjacent properties not owned or
operated by the Company or any of its affiliates other than Vencor and its
direct affiliates). There can be no assurance that Vencor will have the
financial capability to satisfy any such environmental claims. See "--Recent
Developments." If Vencor is unable to satisfy such claims the Company will be
required to satisfy the claims. The Company has agreed to indemnify Vencor
against any environmental claims (including penalties and clean-up costs)
resulting from any condition arising on or under, or relating to, the leased
properties at any time before the commencement date of the Master Leases.
 
  The Company does not expect that the Company will have to make any material
capital expenditures in connection with such environmental, health, and safety
laws, ordinances, and regulations during 1999.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
 General
 
  The operators of the Company's properties derive a substantial portion of
their revenues from third party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and
medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over and certain disabled
persons. Medicaid is a medical assistance program administered by each state
pursuant to which benefits are available to certain indigent patients. Within
the Medicare and Medicaid statutory framework, there are substantial areas
subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and discretion which may
affect payments made under Medicare and Medicaid. The amounts of program
payments received by the operators can be changed by legislative or regulatory
actions and by determinations by agents for the programs. The Balanced Budget
Act of 1997 (the "Budget Act") is intended to reduce the increase in Medicare
payments by $115 billion and reduce the increase in Medicaid payments by $13
billion between 1998 through 2002 and made extensive changes in the Medicare
 
                                      11
<PAGE>
 
and Medicaid programs. In addition, private payors, including managed care
payors, increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures and the
assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk.
Efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon
operators by private payors are expected to continue. Further, on March 25,
1999, President Clinton signed legislation preventing nursing center operators
that decide to withdraw from the Medicaid program from evicting or
transferring patients who rely on Medicaid to cover their long-term care
expenses. There can be no assurances that adequate reimbursement levels will
continue to be available for services to be provided by the operators of the
Company's properties which currently are being reimbursed by Medicare,
Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of services
reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse
effect on these operators' liquidity, financial condition and results of
operations which could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments
to the Company.
 
  The operators of the Company's properties are subject to extensive federal,
state and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to, laws and
regulations relating to licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of
facilities, addition of facilities, services, prices for services and billing
for services. These laws authorize periodic inspections and investigations,
and deficiencies which if not corrected can result in sanctions which include
loss of licensure to operate and loss of rights to participate in the Medicare
and Medicaid programs. Regulatory agencies have substantial powers to affect
the actions of operators of the Company's properties if the agencies believe
that there is an imminent threat to patient welfare, and in some states these
powers can include assumption of interim control over facilities through
receiverships. Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback laws codified under Section
1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the "Anti-kickback Laws") prohibit
certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision
and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare and Medicaid,
including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients
whose care will be paid by Medicare or other governmental programs. Sanctions
for violating the Anti-kickback Laws include criminal penalties and civil
sanctions, including fines and possible exclusion from government programs
such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In the ordinary course of its
business, the operators of the Company's properties are subject regularly to
inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that
oversee these laws and regulations.
 
  Pursuant to the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of
1987, the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") has issued
regulations that describe some of the conduct and business relationships
permissible under the Anti-kickback Laws ("Safe Harbors"). The fact that a
given business arrangement does not fall within a Safe Harbor does not render
the arrangement per se illegal. Business arrangements of healthcare service
providers that fail to satisfy the applicable Safe Harbors criteria, however,
risk increased scrutiny and possible sanctions by enforcement authorities.
 
  The operators of the Company's properties also are subject to Sections 1877
and 1903(s) of the Social Security Act, which restrict referrals by physicians
of Medicare and other government-program patients to providers of a broad
range of designated health services with which they have ownership interests
or certain other financial arrangements. Many states have adopted or are
considering similar legislative proposals, some of which extend beyond the
Medicaid program to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the
referral of patients and physician self-referrals regardless of the source of
the payment for the care. These laws and regulations are extremely complex,
and little judicial or regulatory interpretation exists. These actions could
have a material adverse effect on these operators' liquidity, financial
condition and results of operations which could affect adversely their ability
to make rental payments to the Company.
 
 
                                      12
<PAGE>
 
  Government investigations and enforcement of healthcare laws has increased
dramatically over the past several years and is expected to continue. The
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104- 191)
("HIPAA"), which became effective January 1, 1997, greatly expanded the
definition of healthcare fraud and related offenses and broadened the scope to
include private healthcare plans in addition to government payors. HIPAA also
greatly increased funding for the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Office of the Inspector General to audit, investigate
and prosecute suspected healthcare fraud. Private
enforcement of healthcare fraud also has increased due in large part to
amendments to the civil False Claims Act in 1986 that were designed to
encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These
whistleblower suits by private individuals, known as qui tam relators, may be
filed by almost anyone, including present and former patients, colleagues and
nurses and other employees. These actions could have a material adverse effect
on these operators' liquidity, financial condition and results of operations
which could affect adversely their ability to make rental payments to the
Company.
 
                                     12--1
<PAGE>
 
  The Budget Act also provides a number of additional anti-fraud and abuse
provisions. The Budget Act contains new civil monetary penalties for an
operator's violation of the Anti-kickback Laws and imposes an affirmative duty
on operators to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons
excluded from the Medicare and other government programs. The Budget Act also
provides a minimum ten-year period for exclusion from participation in federal
healthcare programs for operators convicted of a prior healthcare offense.
 
  Some states require state approval for development and expansion of
healthcare facilities and services, including findings of need for additional
or expanded healthcare facilities or services. A certificate of need ("CON"),
which is issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over healthcare
facilities, is at times required for expansion of existing facilities,
construction of new facilities, addition of beds, acquisition of major items
of equipment or introduction of new services. The CON rules and regulations
may restrict an operator's ability to expand the Company's properties in
certain circumstances.
 
  In the event that any operator of the Company's properties fails to make
rental payments to the Company or to comply with the applicable healthcare
regulations, and, in either case, such operators or their lenders fail to cure
the default prior to the expiration of the applicable cure period, the ability
of the Company to evict that operator and substitute another operator or
operators may be materially delayed or limited by various state licensing,
receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by Medicare and Medicaid change-
of-ownership rules. Such delays and limitations could have a material adverse
effect on the Company's ability to collect rent, to obtain possession of
leased properties, or otherwise to exercise remedies for tenant default. In
addition, the Company may also incur substantial additional expenses in
connection with any such licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership
proceedings.
 
 Long-Term Hospitals
 
  All but two of the Company's hospitals are operated as long-term hospitals.
In order to receive Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, each hospital must
meet the applicable conditions of participation set forth by HHS relating to
the type of hospital, its equipment, personnel and standard of medical care,
as well as comply with state and local laws and regulations. Hospitals undergo
periodic on-site certification surveys, which generally are limited if the
hospital is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations ("JCAHO"). A loss of certification could adversely affect a
hospital's ability to receive payments from Medicare and Medicaid programs,
which could in turn adversely impact Vencor's ability to make rental payments
under the Master Leases.
 
  Hospitals that are certified by Medicare as long-term hospitals are excluded
from the prospective payment system that applies to acute care hospitals
("PPS"). A long-term hospital has an average length of stay greater than 25
days. Inpatient operating costs for long-term hospitals are reimbursed under
the cost-based reimbursement system, subject to a computed target rate per
discharge for inpatient operating costs established by the Tax Equity and
Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 ("TEFRA"). Medicare and Medicaid
reimbursements generally are determined from annual cost reports filed by
Vencor and other operators which are subject to audit by the respective agency
administering the program. Under such programs of cost-based reimbursement,
costs which will be accepted for reimbursement are limited by statutes,
regulations and program policies relating to numerous factors, including
necessity, reasonableness, related-party principles and relatedness to patient
care.
 
 Nursing Centers
 
  The operators of the Company's nursing centers generally are licensed on an
annual or bi-annual basis and certified annually for participation in the
Medicare and Medicaid programs through various regulatory agencies which
determine compliance with federal, state and local laws. These legal
requirements relate to the quality of the nursing care provided,
qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff, the adequacy
of the physical plant and equipment and continuing compliance with the laws
and regulations governing the operation of nursing centers.
 
 
                                      13
<PAGE>
 
  The Budget Act also established a prospective payment system for nursing
centers for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1998
("Nursing Center PPS"). During a nursing center's first three cost reporting
periods under Nursing Center PPS, the per diem rates are based on a blend of
facility-specific costs and federal costs. Thereafter, the per diem rates will
be based solely on federal costs. The rates for such services were first
published in the Federal Register on May 12, 1998, after the consummation of
the Reorganization. The payments
 
                                     13--1
<PAGE>
 
received under the new Nursing Center PPS cover all services for Medicare
patients, including all ancillary services, such as respiratory therapy,
physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and certain covered
drugs. The new Nursing Center PPS has resulted, and will likely continue to
result in, reduced reimbursement for the operators of the Company's
properties, thereby adversely impacting the operators' ability to satisfy
their obligations, including payment of rent, under the leases with the
Company.
 
 Healthcare Reform
 
  Healthcare is one of the largest industries in the United States and
continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention. The
Budget Act, enacted in August 1997, contains extensive changes to the Medicare
and Medicaid programs intended to reduce the projected amount of increase in
payments under those programs by $115 billion and $13 billion, respectively,
between 1998 and 2002. Under the Budget Act, annual growth rates for Medicare
will be reduced from over 10% to approximately 7.5% for the period between
1998 and 2002 based on specific program baseline projections from 1993 to
1997. Virtually all spending reductions will come from healthcare operators
and changes in program components.
 
  The Budget Act reduced payments made to the hospitals operated by Vencor and
others by reducing incentive payments pursuant to TEFRA, allowable costs for
capital expenditures and bad debts, and payments for services to patients
transferred from a PPS hospital. The reductions in allowable costs for capital
expenditures became effective October 1, 1997. The reductions in the TEFRA
incentive payments and allowable costs for bad debts became effective between
May 1, 1998 and September 1, 1998 with respect to the Company's hospitals. The
reductions for payments for services to patients transferred from a PPS
hospital became effective October 1, 1998. The Budget Act also established
Nursing Center PPS for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1,
1998. During a nursing center's first three cost reporting periods under
Nursing Center PPS, the per diem rates will be based on a blend of facility-
specific costs and federal costs. Thereafter, the per diem rates will be based
solely on federal costs. The rates for such services were published by the
Health Care Financing Administration ("HCFA") in the Federal Register on May
12, 1998. The payments received under PPS cover all services for Medicare
patients, including all ancillary services, such as respiratory therapy,
physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and certain covered
drugs. The payments that Vencor and others are receiving under Nursing Center
PPS are substantially less than before enactment of the Budget Act. Vencor has
been subject to Nursing Center PPS since July 1, 1998.
 
  The Budget Act established the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future
of Medicare, which held its first meeting on March 6, 1998, and charged it
with reviewing and analyzing financial conditions of Medicare, identifying
problems that threaten the financial integrity of the Medicare Trust Fund, and
making recommendations to address the program's long-term financing
challenges. The Commission recently concluded its deliberations without making
an official recommendation, but proposals considered by the Commission are now
under independent consideration by the Congress. The Budget Act also afforded
states more flexibility in administering their Medicaid plans, including the
ability to shift most Medicaid enrollees into managed care plans without first
obtaining a federal waiver. Accordingly, the Medicare and Medicaid programs,
including payment levels and methods, are in a state of change and are less
predictable than before enactment of the Budget Act.
 
  There can be no assurance that the Budget Act, future healthcare legislation
or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental
healthcare programs will not have a material adverse effect on the liquidity,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company's operators which
could have a material adverse effect on their ability to make rental payments
to the Company.
 
Federal Income Tax Considerations
 
  The Company intends to make an election to be taxed as a REIT under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), commencing with its
taxable year that began on January 1, 1999. The Company believes it has been
organized and has operated in such a manner as to enable it to qualify as a
REIT commencing with that taxable year, and the Company intends to continue to
operate in such a manner as to enable it to so qualify. The Company's actual
qualification and taxation as a REIT, however, will depend upon its ability to
 
                                      14
<PAGE>
 
meet on a continuing basis, through actual annual operating results,
distribution levels, and stock ownership, the various qualification tests
imposed under the Code. These tests are discussed below. No assurance can be
given that the actual results of the Company's operations for any particular
taxable year will satisfy such requirements. For a discussion of the tax
consequences of failing to qualify as a REIT, see "--Failure to Qualify,"
below.
 
  The discussion of "Federal Income Tax Considerations" set forth herein is
not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations and is not tax advice.
Moreover this summary does not deal with all tax aspects that might be
relevant to a particular stockholder in light of his personal circumstances,
nor does it deal with particular types of stockholders that are subject to
special treatment under the Code, such as insurance companies, financial
institutions and broker-dealers. The Code provisions governing the federal
income tax treatment of REITs are highly technical and complex, and this
summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable Code provisions, rules
and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and administrative and
judicial interpretations thereof. The following discussion is based on current
law, which could be changed at any time, possibly retroactively.
 
 Federal Income Taxation of the Company
 
  As noted above, the Company intends to make an election to be taxed as a
REIT commencing with its taxable year that began on January 1, 1999. With
respect to that taxable year and subsequent taxable years, if the Company
qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to federal
corporate income tax on net income that it currently distributes to
stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the "double taxation"
(i.e., taxation at both the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally
results from investment in a corporation. Notwithstanding its REIT election,
however, the Company will be subject to federal income tax in the following
circumstances. First, the Company will be taxed at regular corporate rates on
any undistributed taxable income, including undistributed net capital gains.
Second, under certain circumstances, the Company may be subject to the
"alternative minimum tax" on its undistributed items of tax preference. Third,
if the Company has (i) net income from the sale or other disposition of
"foreclosure property" (which is, in general, property acquired by foreclosure
or otherwise on default of a loan secured by the property) that is held
primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or (ii)
other non-qualifying income from foreclosure property, it will be subject to
tax at the highest corporate rate on such income. Fourth, if the Company has
net income from "prohibited transactions" (which are, in general, certain
sales or other dispositions of property (other than foreclosure property) held
primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business), such
income will be subject to a 100% tax. Fifth, if the Company should fail to
satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test (as discussed
below), and has nonetheless maintained its qualification as a REIT because
certain other requirements have been met, it will be subject to a 100% tax on
the product of (a) the gross income attributable to the greater of the amount
by which the Company fails the 75% or 95% gross income test, and (b) a
fraction intended to reflect the Company's profitability. Sixth, if the
Company should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum
of (i) 85% of its REIT ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of its REIT
capital gain net income for such year (other than retained long-term capital
gain the Company elects to treat as having been distributed to stockholders),
and (iii) any undistributed taxable income from prior years, the Company would
be subject to a non-deductible 4% excise tax on the excess of such required
distribution over the amounts actually distributed. Seventh, if the Company
should receive rents from a tenant deemed not to be fair market value rents,
or if the Company values its assets incorrectly, the Company may be liable for
valuation penalties. Finally, if the Company acquires any asset from a C
corporation (i.e., a corporation generally subject to full corporate level
tax) in a transaction in which the basis of the asset in the Company's hands
is determined by reference to the basis of the asset (or any other asset) in
the hands of the C corporation, and the Company recognizes gain on the
disposition of such asset during the 10-year period (the "Recognition Period")
beginning on the date on which such asset was acquired by the Company, then,
to the extent of such asset's "Built-in Gain" (i.e., the excess of the fair
market value of such property at the time of acquisition by the Company over
the adjusted basis of such asset at such time), such gain will be subject to
tax at the highest regular corporate rate applicable (as provided in
regulations that have been announced but not yet promulgated (the "Built-in
Gain Rules")).
 
 
                                      15
<PAGE>
 
  The Company owns appreciated assets that it held on January 1, 1999, the
effective date of its anticipated REIT election. These assets are subject to
the Built-in Gain Rules discussed above because the Company was a taxable C
corporation prior to January 1, 1999. If the Company recognizes taxable gain
upon the disposition of any of these assets within the ten-year Recognition
Period, the Company generally will be subject to regular corporate income tax
on that gain to the extent of the Built-in Gain in that asset as of January 1,
1999. The total amount of gain on which the Company can be taxed under the
Built-in Gain Rules is limited to its net built-in gain at the time it became
a REIT, i.e., the excess of the aggregate fair market value of its assets at
the time it became a REIT over the adjusted tax bases of those assets at that
time.
 
 Requirements for Qualification
 
  To qualify as a REIT, the Company must elect to be so treated and must meet
the requirements, discussed below, relating to the Company's organization,
sources of income, nature of assets and distributions of income to
stockholders.
 
 Organizational Requirements
 
  The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association (i) that is
managed by one or more directors or trustees; (ii) the beneficial ownership of
which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of
beneficial interest; (iii) that would be taxable as a domestic corporation,
but for Sections 856 through 859 of the Code; (iv) that is neither a financial
institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the
Code; (v) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons
during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a
proportionate part of a shorter taxable year (the "100 Shareholder Rule");
(vi) not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned,
directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code
to include certain entities) during the last half of each taxable year (the
"5/50 Rule"); (vii) that makes an election to be a REIT (or has made such
election for a previous taxable year) and satisfies all relevant filing and
other administrative requirements established by the IRS that must be met in
order to elect and to maintain REIT status; (viii) that uses a calendar year
for federal income tax purposes; and (ix) that meets certain other tests,
described below, regarding the nature of its income and assets. The 5/50 Rule
and the 100 Shareholder Rule do not apply to the first taxable year for which
an election is made to be taxed as a REIT; thus, these rules will not apply to
the Company until the year 2000 (assuming as is anticipated that 1999 will be
the Company's first taxable year as a REIT).
 
  For purposes of the 5/50 Rule, an unemployment compensation benefits plan, a
private foundation or a portion of a trust permanently set aside or used
exclusively for charitable purposes generally is considered an individual. A
trust that is a qualified trust under Section 401(a) of the Code, however,
generally is not considered an individual and the beneficiaries of such trust
are treated as holding shares of a REIT in proportion to their actuarial
interests in such trust for purposes of the 5/50 Rule. A REIT will be treated
as having satisfied the 5/50 Rule if it complies with certain regulations for
ascertaining the ownership of its stock and if it did not know (or after the
exercise of reasonable diligence would not have known) that its stock was
sufficiently closely held to cause it to violate the 5/50 Rule. See "Annual
Record Keeping Requirements," below.
 
  In order prevent a concentration of ownership of the Company's stock that
would cause the Company to fail the 5/50 Rule or the 100 Shareholder Rule, the
Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation on April 30, 1998 to provide
that no holder (with certain exceptions) is permitted to own, either actually
or constructively under the applicable attribution rules of the Code, more
than 9.0% of the Common Stock or 9.9% of any class of preferred stock issued
by the Company. Certain persons who owned stock in the Company in excess of
the foregoing limits on April 30, 1998 (the date that the Certificate of
Incorporation was amended) are not subject to the general ownership limits
applicable to other stockholders; rather, they generally are permitted to own
up to the same percentage of the Company's outstanding stock that they owned
on April 30, 1998. No holder, however, is permitted to own, either actually or
constructively under the applicable attribution rules of the Code, any shares
of any class of the Company's stock if such ownership would cause more than
50% in value of the Company's outstanding stock to be owned by five or fewer
individuals or would result in the Company's stock being beneficially owned by
fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference to any rule of
attribution).
 
                                      16
<PAGE>
 
  To qualify as a REIT, a corporation may not have (as of the end of the
taxable year) any earnings and profits that were accumulated in periods before
it elected REIT status. The Company believes that it currently does not have,
and believes that it will not have as of December 31, 1999, any accumulated
earnings and profits that are attributable to periods during which the Company
was not a REIT.
 
  Section 856(i) of the Code provides that a corporation that is a "qualified
REIT subsidiary" will not be treated as a separate corporation for federal
income tax purposes, and all assets, liabilities, and items of income,
deduction and credit of a qualified REIT subsidiary will be treated as assets,
liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of the REIT. A
"qualified subsidiary" is defined as any wholly owned corporate subsidiary of
a REIT. The Company does not currently have any qualified REIT subsidiaries.
 
  Pursuant to Treasury Regulations relating to entity classification (the
"Check-the-Box Regulations"), an unincorporated entity that has a single owner
is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for federal income tax
purposes. The Company directly owns a 98% general partnership interest in the
Operating Partnership and indirectly owns the remaining 2% limited partnership
interest in the Operating Partnership through two wholly owned limited
liability companies. Under the Check-the-Box Regulations, the two limited
liability companies, and therefore the Operating Partnership, are disregarded
as entities separate from the Company for federal income tax purposes.
 
  In the case of a REIT that is a partner in a partnership, Treasury
regulations provide that the REIT will be deemed to own its proportionate
share of the assets of the partnership and will be deemed to be entitled to
the income of the partnership attributable to such share. In addition, the
character of the assets and gross income of the partnership will retain the
same character in the hands of the REIT for purposes of the income and asset
tests described below. If and when the Operating Partnership admits a partner
other than the Company, a qualified REIT subsidiary of the Company, or a
entity that is disregarded under the Check-the-Box Regulations as an entity
separate from the Company, the Company's proportionate share of the assets and
gross income of the Operating Partnership will be treated as the assets and
gross income of the Company for purposes of applying the requirements
described herein.
 
 Income Tests
 
  To qualify as a REIT, the Company must satisfy certain annual gross income
requirements. First, at least 75% of the Company's gross income (excluding
gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must consist
of defined types of income derived directly or indirectly from investments
relating to real property or mortgages on real property (including "rents from
real property" (defined below) and, in certain circumstances, interest) or
certain types of temporary investment income. Second, at least 95% of the
Company's gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions)
for each taxable year must be derived from such real property or temporary
investments, dividends, interest and gain from the sale or disposition of
stock or securities, or from any combination of the foregoing.
 
  Substantially all of the Company's gross income is derived from leasing its
properties to Vencor under the Master Leases. Rents received or deemed
received by the Company under its leases (including the Master Leases) will
qualify as "rents from real property" in satisfying the gross income
requirements described above only if the Company's leases are respected as
"true" leases for federal income tax purposes and are not treated as service
contracts, joint ventures, or some other type of arrangement. The
determination of whether the Company's leases are true leases depends on an
analysis of all the surrounding facts and circumstances. In making such a
determination, courts have considered a variety of factors, including the
following: (i) the intent of the parties, (ii) the form of the agreement,
(iii) the degree of control over the property that is retained by the property
owner (e.g., whether the lessee has substantial control over the operation of
the property or whether the lessee was required to use its best efforts to
perform its obligations under the agreement), and (iv) the extent to which the
property owner retains the risk of loss with respect to the property (e.g.,
whether the lessee bears the risk of increases in operating expenses or the
risk of damage to the property) or the potential for economic gains (e.g.,
appreciation) with respect to the property. Based upon advice of counsel at
the time the Master Leases
 
                                      17
<PAGE>
 
were negotiated, the Company believes that its leases should be treated as
"true" leases for federal income tax purposes. Investors should be aware,
however, that there are no controlling Treasury regulations, published
rulings, or judicial decisions involving leases with terms substantially the
same as the Company's leases that discuss whether such leases constitute true
leases for federal income tax purposes. If the leases are recharacterized as
service contracts or partnership agreements, rather than true leases, part or
all of the payments that the Company receives from its tenants would not be
considered rent or would not otherwise satisfy the various requirements for
qualification as "rents from real property." In that case, the Company likely
would not be able to satisfy either the 75% or the 95% gross income tests,
and, as a result, would lose its REIT status.
 
  Assuming that the Company's leases are "true" leases for tax purposes, rents
received by the Company will qualify as "rents from real property" for
purposes of the REIT gross income tests only if several additional conditions
are satisfied. First, the amount of rent generally must not be based in whole
or in part on the income or profits of any person. However, an amount received
or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term "rents from real
property" solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages
of receipts or sales. Second, amounts received from a tenant will not qualify
as "rents from real property" if the Company, or an owner of 10% or more of
the Company, directly or constructively is deemed to own 10% or more of the
ownership interests in the tenant (a "Related Party Tenant"). Third, if rent
attributable to personal property, leased in connection with a lease of real
property, is greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease, then
the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as
"rents from real property." Finally, for rents received to qualify as "rents
from real property," the Company generally must not operate or manage the
property or furnish or render services to the tenants of such property, other
than through an "independent contractor" who is adequately compensated and
from whom the Company derives no income. The "independent contractor"
requirement, however, does not apply to the extent that the services provided
by the Company are "usually or customarily rendered in connection with the
rental of space for occupancy only," which are services of a type that a tax-
exempt organization can provide to its tenants without causing its rental
income to be unrelated business taxable income ("UBTI"). In addition, the
"independent contractor" requirement does not apply to noncustomary services
provided by the Company, the annual value of which does not exceed 1% of the
gross income derived from the property with respect to which the services are
provided (the "1% de minimis exception"). For this purpose, such services may
not be valued at less than 150% of the Company's direct cost of providing the
services.
 
  The Company has not, and does not anticipate that it will in the future, (i)
charge rent that is based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any
person (except by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages
of receipts or sales consistent with the rule described above), (ii) derive
rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with real property
that exceeds 15% of the total rents, (iii) derive rent attributable to a
Related Party Tenant, or (iv) provide any noncustomary services to tenants
other than through qualifying independent contractors, except as permitted by
the 1% de minimis exception or to the extent that the amount of resulting
nonqualifying income would not cause the Company to fail to satisfy the 95%
and 75% gross income tests.
 
  If rents received by the Company from Vencor under the Master Leases do not
represent fair market value rentals at the time of execution of the Master
Leases and the IRS determines that the Company and Vencor were under common
control at that time, the IRS may reallocate income between the Company and
Vencor. The reallocation could cause the Company or Vencor to become subject
to valuation penalties. The Company believes that the rent payments represent
fair market value rentals.
 
  If the Company fails to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income
tests for any taxable year, it may nevertheless qualify as a REIT for such
year if it is entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. These
relief provisions generally will be available if the Company's failure to meet
such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the
Company attaches a schedule of the sources of its income to its return and any
incorrect information on the schedules was not due to fraud with intent to
evade tax. It is not possible, however, to state whether in all circumstances
the Company would be entitled to the benefit of these
 
                                      18
<PAGE>
 
relief provisions. Even if these relief provisions were to apply, a tax would
be imposed with respect to the excess net income.
 
 Asset Tests
 
  At the close of each quarter of its taxable year, the Company must satisfy
two tests relating to the nature of its assets. First, at least 75% of the
value of the Company's total assets must be represented by cash or cash items
(including certain receivables), government securities, "real estate assets"
or, in cases where the Company raises new capital through stock or long-term
(at least five years) debt offerings, temporary investments in stock or debt
instruments during the one-year period following the Company's receipt of such
capital (the "75% asset test"). The term "real estate asset" includes
interests in real property, interests in mortgages on real property to the
extent the mortgage balance does not exceed the value of the associated real
property, and shares of other REITs. For purposes of the 75% asset test, the
term "interest in real property" includes an interest in land and improvements
thereon, such as buildings or other inherently permanent structures (including
items that are structural components of such buildings or structures), a
leasehold in real property and an option to acquire real property (or a
leasehold in real property). Second, of the investments not included in the
75% asset class, the value of any one issuer's debt and equity securities
owned by the Company (other than the Company's interest in any entity
classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, or the stock of a
qualified REIT subsidiary) may not exceed 5% of the value of the Company's
total assets (the "5% asset test"), and the Company may not own more than 10%
of any one issuer's outstanding voting securities (except for the Company's
ownership interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes or the stock of a qualified REIT subsidiary) (the
"10% voting securities test").
 
  If the Company should fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a
calendar quarter, such a failure would not cause it to fail to qualify as a
REIT or to lose its REIT status if (i) it satisfied all of the asset tests at
the close of the preceding calendar quarter and (ii) the discrepancy between
the value of the Company's assets and the asset test requirements arose from
changes in the market values of its assets and was not wholly or partly caused
by an acquisition of nonqualifying assets. If the condition described in
clause (ii) of the preceding sentence were not satisfied, the Company still
could avoid disqualification by eliminating any discrepancy within 30 days
after the close of the calendar quarter in which it arose. The Company intends
to maintain adequate records of the value of its assets to ensure compliance
with the asset tests and to take such other actions as may be required to
comply with those tests.
 
 Annual Distribution Requirements
 
  In order to be taxed as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute
dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to its stockholders in an amount
at least equal to (i) the sum of (A) 95% of the Company's "REIT taxable
income" (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and its net
capital gain) and (B) 95% of the net income (after tax), if any, from
foreclosure property, minus (ii) the sum of certain items of noncash income.
Such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or
in the following taxable year if declared before the Company timely files its
tax return for such year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend
payment after such declaration. To the extent that the Company does not
distribute all of its net capital gain or distributes at least 95%, but less
than 100%, of its "REIT taxable income," as adjusted, it will be subject to
tax on the undistributed amount at regular capital gains and ordinary
corporate tax rates. Furthermore, if the Company should fail to distribute
during each calendar year at least the sum of (i) 85% of its REIT ordinary
income for such year, (ii) 95% of its REIT capital gain net income for such
year (other than long-term capital gain the Company elects to retain and treat
as having been distributed to stockholders), and (iii) any undistributed
taxable income from prior periods, the Company will be subject to a 4%
nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the
amounts actually distributed. In addition, during its Recognition Period, if
the Company disposes of any assets subject to the Built-in Gain Rules, the
Company will be required, pursuant to guidance issued by the IRS, to
distribute at least 95% of the Built-in Gain (after tax), if any, recognized
on the disposition of the asset.
 
  It is expected that the Company's REIT taxable income will be less than its
cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non-cash deductions
in computing REIT taxable income. Accordingly, the Company
 
                                      19
<PAGE>
 
anticipates that it generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to
enable it to satisfy the 95% distribution requirement. It is possible,
however, that the Company, from time to time, may not have sufficient cash or
other liquid assets to meet the 95% distribution requirement or to distribute
such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation,
as a result of timing differences between (i) the actual receipt of income and
actual payment of deductible expenses and (ii) the inclusion of such income
and deduction of such expenses in arriving at the Company's taxable income, or
as a result of nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or
repayments, or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions. In the
event that such timing differences occur, the Company may find it necessary to
borrow funds or to issue equity securities (there being no assurance that it
will be able to do so) or, if possible, to pay taxable stock dividends in
order to meet the REIT distribution requirements. The Company's debt
facilities may restrict the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness
under certain circumstances, thereby preventing the Company from borrowing
funds in order to make such distributions. In addition, the failure of Vencor
to make rental payments under the Master Leases would impair materially the
ability of the Company to make distributions. Consequently, there can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to make distributions at the required
distribution rate or any other rate.
 
  Under certain circumstances, the Company may be able to rectify a failure to
meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying "deficiency dividends"
to stockholders in a later year, which may be included in the Company's
deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year. Although the Company may be
able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends, it
will be required to pay interest to the IRS based upon the amount of any
deduction taken for deficiency dividends.
 
 Annual Record Keeping Requirements
 
  In its first taxable year in which it qualifies as a REIT and thereafter,
the Company is required to maintain certain records and request on an annual
basis certain information from its stockholders designed to disclose the
actual ownership of its outstanding shares. The Company intends to comply with
these requirements. The Company will be subject to a penalty of $25,000
($50,000 for intentional violations) for any year in which it does not comply
with the rules.
 
 Failure to Qualify
 
  If the Company does not make an election to be taxed as a REIT because it
cannot meet the applicable requirements for REIT qualification, the Company
will be subject to tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on
its taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders
will not be deductible by the Company, nor will they be required to be made.
To the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits, all
distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income, and, subject
to certain limitations in the Code, corporate stockholders may be eligible for
the dividends received deduction. If the Company does not make an election to
be taxed as a REIT with respect to the current taxable year (1999), it will
not for that reason be prevented from making an election to be taxed as a REIT
with respect to any subsequent taxable year.
 
  If the Company elects to be taxed as a REIT and that election is revoked or
terminated (e.g., due to a failure to meet the REIT qualification tests), the
Company and its stockholders generally would be subject to the same tax
consequences that are described in the preceding paragraph in the taxable year
in which the Company ceased to qualify as a REIT. In addition, the Company
would be prohibited from re-electing REIT status for the four taxable years
following the year during which the Company ceased to qualify as a REIT,
unless certain relief provisions of the Code applied. It is impossible to
predict whether the Company would be entitled to such statutory relief.
 
 Taxation of U.S. Stockholders
 
  As used herein, the term "U.S. Stockholder" means a holder of the Company's
common stock (the "Common Stock") that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is
(i) a citizen or resident of the United States,
 
                                      20
<PAGE>
 
(ii)  a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision thereof,
(iii) an estate whose income from sources without the United States is
includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of
its connection with the conduct of a trade or business within the United
States or (iv) any trust with respect to which (A) a U.S. court is able to
exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and (B) one
or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions
of the trust.
 
  As long as the Company qualifies as a REIT, distributions made to the
Company's taxable U.S. Stockholders out of current or accumulated earnings and
profits (and not designated as capital gain dividends) will be taken into
account by such U.S. Stockholders as ordinary income and will not be eligible
for the dividends received deduction generally available to corporations.
Distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as a
capital gain (to the extent such distributions do not exceed the Company's
actual net capital gain for the taxable year) without regard to the period for
which the stockholder has held its shares. The tax rates applicable to such
capital gains are discussed below. However, corporate stockholders may be
required to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary
income. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and
profits will not be taxable to a stockholder to the extent that they do not
exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholder's shares, but rather will reduce
the adjusted basis of such shares. To the extent that distributions in excess
of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a
stockholder's shares, such distributions will be included in income as capital
gains assuming the shares are capital assets in the hands of the stockholder.
The tax rate applicable to such capital gain will depend on the stockholder's
holding period for the shares. In addition, any distribution declared by the
Company in October, November or December of any year and payable to a
stockholder of record on a specified date in any such month shall be treated
as both paid by the Company and received by the stockholder on December 31 of
such year, provided that the distribution is actually paid by the Company
during January of the following calendar year.
 
  The Company may elect to treat all or a part of its undistributed net
capital gain as if it had been distributed to its stockholders (including for
purposes of the 4% excise tax discussed above under "Requirements for
Qualification--Annual Distribution Requirements"). If the Company should make
such an election, the Company's stockholders would be required to include in
their income as long-term capital gain their proportionate share of the
Company's undistributed net capital gain, as designated by the Company. Each
such stockholder would be deemed to have paid its proportionate share of the
income tax imposed on the Company with respect to such undistributed net
capital gain, and this amount would be credited or refunded to the
stockholder. In addition, the tax basis of the stockholder's shares would be
increased by its proportionate share of undistributed net capital gains
included in its income, less its proportionate share of the income tax imposed
on the Company with respect to such gains.
 
  Stockholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any net
operating losses or capital losses of the Company. Instead, such losses would
be carried over by the Company for potential offset against its future income
(subject to certain limitations). Taxable distributions from the Company and
gain from the disposition of the Common Stock will not be treated as passive
activity income and, therefore, stockholders generally will not be able to
apply any "passive activity losses" (such as losses from certain types of
limited partnerships in which the stockholder is a limited partner) against
such income. In addition, taxable distributions from the Company generally
will be treated as investment income for purposes of the investment interest
limitations. Capital gains from the disposition of the shares (or
distributions treated as such) will be treated as investment income only if
the stockholder so elects, in which case such capital gains will be taxed at
ordinary income rates. The Company will notify stockholders after the close of
the Company's taxable year as to the portions of the distributions
attributable to that year that constitute ordinary income, return of capital
and capital gain.
 
  In general, any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of the
Common Stock by a stockholder who is not a dealer in securities will be
treated as capital gain or loss. Lower marginal tax rates for individuals may
apply in the case of capital gains, depending on the holding period of the
shares that are sold. However, any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares by a
stockholder who has held such shares for six months or less (after
 
                                      21
<PAGE>
 
applying certain holding period rules) will be treated as a long-term capital
loss to the extent of distributions from the Company required to be treated by
such stockholder as long-term capital gain. All or a portion of any loss
realized upon a taxable disposition of shares may be disallowed if other
shares are purchased within 30 days before or after the disposition.
 
  For non-corporate taxpayers, the tax rate differential between capital gain
and ordinary income may be significant. The highest marginal individual income
tax rate applicable to ordinary income is 39.6%. Any capital gain generally
will be taxed to a non-corporate taxpayer at a maximum rate of 20% with
respect to capital assets held for more than one year. The tax rates
applicable to ordinary income apply to gain attributable to the sale or
exchange of capital assets held for one year or less. In the case of capital
gain attributable to the sale or exchange of certain real property held for
more than one year, an amount of such gain equal to the amount of all prior
depreciation deductions not otherwise required to be taxed as ordinary
depreciation recapture income will be taxed at a maximum rate of 25%. With
respect to distributions designated by a REIT as capital gain dividends
(including deemed distributions of retained capital gains), the REIT also may
designate (subject to certain limits) whether the dividend is taxable to non-
corporate stockholders as a 20% rate gain distribution or an unrecaptured
depreciation distribution taxed at a 25% rate.
 
  The characterization of income as capital or ordinary may affect the
deductibility of capital losses. Capital losses not offset by capital gains
may be deducted against a non-corporate taxpayer's ordinary income only up to
a maximum annual amount of $3,000. Non-corporate taxpayers may carry forward
their unused capital losses. All net capital gain of a corporate taxpayer is
subject to tax at ordinary corporate rates. A corporate taxpayer can deduct
capital losses only to the extent of capital gains, with unused losses being
carried back three years and forward five years.
 
 Treatment of Tax-Exempt Stockholders
 
  Tax-exempt organizations, including qualified employee pension and profit
sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts, (collectively, "Exempt
Organizations") generally are exempt from federal income taxation. However,
they are subject to taxation on their UBTI. While many investments in real
estate generate UBTI, the IRS has issued a published ruling that dividend
distributions by a REIT to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute
UBTI, provided that the shares of the REIT are not otherwise used in an
unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust. Based on
that ruling, and subject to the exceptions discussed below, amounts
distributed by the Company to Exempt Organizations generally should not
constitute UBTI. However, if an Exempt Organization finances its acquisition
of the Common Stock with debt, a portion of its income from the Company will
constitute UBTI pursuant to the "debt-financed property" rules. Furthermore,
social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental
unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans that are
exempt from taxation under paragraphs (7), (9), (17) and (20), respectively,
of Section 501(c) of the Code are subject to different UBTI rules, which
generally will require them to characterize distributions from the Company as
UBTI. In addition, in certain circumstances, a pension trust that owns more
than 10% of the Company's stock is required to treat a percentage of the
dividends from the Company as UBTI (the "UBTI Percentage"). The UBTI
Percentage is the gross income, less related direct expenses, derived by the
Company from an unrelated trade or business (determined as if the Company were
a pension trust) divided by the gross income, less related direct expenses, of
the Company for the year in which the dividends are paid. The UBTI rule
applies to a pension trust holding more than 10% of the Company's stock only
if (i) the UBTI Percentage is at least 5%, (ii) the Company qualifies as a
REIT by reason of the modification of the 5/50 Rule that allows the
beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares of the
Company in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and
(iii) either (A) one pension trust owns more than 25% of the value of the
Company's stock or (B) a group of pension trusts individually holding more
than 10% of the value of the Company's stock collectively own more than 50% of
the value of the Company's stock.
 
 Special Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Stockholders
 
  The rules governing U.S. federal income taxation of nonresident alien
individuals, foreign corporations, foreign partnerships and other foreign
stockholders (collectively, "Non-U.S. Stockholders") are complex, and
 
                                      22
<PAGE>
 
no attempt will be made herein to provide more than a summary of such rules.
Non-U.S. stockholders should consult with their own tax advisors to determine
the impact of federal, state and local income tax laws with regard to their
ownership of the Common Stock, including any reporting requirements.
 
  For purposes of this discussion, the term "Non-U.S. Stockholder" does not
include any foreign stockholder whose investment in the Company's stock is
"effectively connected" with the conduct of a trade or business in the United
States. Such a foreign stockholder, in general, will be subject to United
States federal income tax with respect to its investment in the Company's
stock in the same manner as a U.S. Stockholder is taxed (subject to applicable
alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of
nonresident alien individuals). In addition, a foreign corporation receiving
income that is treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business
also may be subject to an additional 30% "branch profits tax," unless an
applicable tax treaty provides a lower rate or an exemption. Certain
certification requirements must be satisfied in order for effectively
connected income to be exempt from withholding.
 
  Distributions to Non-U.S. Stockholders that are not attributable to gain
from sales or exchanges by the Company of U.S. real property interests and are
not designated by the Company as capital gain dividends (or deemed
distributions of retained capital gains) will be treated as dividends of
ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of current or accumulated
earnings and profits of the Company. Such distributions ordinarily will be
subject to a withholding tax equal to 30% of the gross amount of the
distribution unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates that tax.
Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits of the
Company will not be taxable to a stockholder to the extent that such
distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholder's shares,
but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of such shares. To the extent that
distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed
the adjusted basis of a Non-U.S. Stockholder's shares, such distributions will
give rise to tax liability if the Non-U.S. Stockholder would otherwise be
subject to tax on any gain from the sale or disposition of its shares, as
described below.
 
  For any year in which the Company qualifies as a REIT, distributions that
are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by the Company of U.S. real
property interests will be taxed to a Non-U.S. Stockholder under the
provisions of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980
("FIRPTA"). Under FIRPTA, distributions attributable to gain from sales of
U.S. real property interests are taxed to a Non-U.S. Stockholder as if such
gain were effectively connected with a U.S. business. Non-U.S. Stockholders
thus would be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to U.S.
Stockholders (subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special
alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals).
Distributions subject to FIRPTA also may be subject to a 30% branch profits
tax in the hands of a foreign corporate stockholder not entitled to treaty
relief or exemption.
 
  Unless a reduced rate of withholding applies under an applicable tax treaty,
the Company generally will withhold from distributions to Non-U.S.
Stockholders, and remit to the IRS, 30% of all distributions out of current or
accumulated earnings and profits, subject to the application of FIRPTA
withholding rules discussed below. In addition, the Company is required to
withhold 10% of any distribution in excess of its current and accumulated
earnings and profits. Because the Company generally cannot determine at the
time a distribution is made whether or not it will be in excess of earnings
and profits, the Company intends to withhold 30% of the entire amount of any
distribution (other than distributions subject to the 35% withholding
discussed below). Generally, however, a Non-U.S. Stockholder will be entitled
to a refund from the IRS to the extent an amount is withheld from a
distribution that exceeds the amount of U.S. tax owed by such Non-U.S.
Stockholder.
 
  Under FIRPTA, the Company is required to withhold 35% of any distribution
that is designated as a capital gain dividend or which could be designated as
a capital gain dividend. Thus, if the Company designates previously made
distributions as capital gain dividends, subsequent distributions (up to the
amount of such prior distributions) will be treated as capital gain dividends
for purposes of FIRPTA withholding.
 
  Under Regulations that are currently in effect, dividends paid to an address
in a country outside the United States generally are presumed to be paid to a
resident of such country for purposes of determining the
 
                                      23
<PAGE>
 
applicability of withholding discussed above and the applicability of a tax
treaty rate. Regulations issued in October 1997, however, provide that a Non-
U.S. Stockholder who wishes to claim the benefit of an applicable treaty rate
must satisfy certain certification and other requirements. Such Regulations
generally will be effective for distributions made after December 31, 1999.
 
  For so long as the Common Stock continues to be regularly traded on an
established securities market, the sale of such stock by any Non-U.S.
Stockholder who is not a Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder (as defined below)
generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax (unless the
Non-U.S. Stockholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the
United States for more than 182 days during the taxable year of the sale and
certain other conditions apply, in which case such gain will be subject to a
30% tax on a gross basis). A "Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder" is a Non-U.S.
Stockholder who, at some time during the five-year period preceding such sale
or disposition, beneficially owned (including under certain attribution rules)
more than 5% of the total fair market value of the Common Stock (as
outstanding from time to time) or owned shares of another class of stock of
the Company that represented value greater than 5% of the Common Stock
(measured at the time such shares were acquired).
 
  In general, the sale or other taxable disposition of the Common Stock by a
Five Percent Non-U.S. Stockholder (as defined below) also will not be subject
to United States federal income tax if the Company is a "domestically
controlled REIT." A REIT is a "domestically controlled REIT" if, at all times
during the five-year period preceding the relevant testing date, less than 50%
in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by Non-U.S. Stockholders
(taking into account those persons required to include the Company's dividends
in income for United States federal income tax purposes). Although the Company
believes that it currently qualifies as a "domestically controlled REIT,"
because the Common Stock is publicly traded, no assurance can be given that
the Company will qualify as a domestically controlled REIT at any time in the
future. If the Company does not constitute a domestically controlled REIT, a
Five Percent Non- U.S. Stockholder will be taxable in the same manner as a
U.S. Stockholder with respect to gain on the sale of the Common Stock (subject
to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in
the case of nonresident alien individuals).
 
 Information Reporting Requirements and Backup Withholding Tax
 
  The Company will report to its U.S. Stockholders and to the IRS the amount
of distributions paid during each calendar year, and the amount of tax
withheld, if any. Under the backup withholding rules, a stockholder may be
subject to backup withholding at the rate of 31% with respect to distributions
paid unless such holder (i) is a corporation or comes within certain other
exempt categories and, when required, demonstrates this fact or (ii) provides
a taxpayer identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from
backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of
the backup withholding rules. A stockholder who does not provide the Company
with its correct taxpayer identification number also may be subject to
penalties imposed by the IRS. In addition, the Company may be required to
withhold a portion of capital gain distributions to any stockholders who fail
to certify their non-foreign status to the Company.
 
  U.S. Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their
qualifications for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for
obtaining such an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax.
Rather, the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a
U.S. Stockholder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Stockholder's
United States federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S.
Stockholder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished
to the IRS.
 
  Backup withholding tax and information reporting generally will not apply to
distributions paid to Non-U.S. Stockholders outside the United States that are
treated as (i) dividends subject to the 30% (or lower treaty rate) withholding
tax discussed above, (ii) capital gain dividends or (iii) distributions
attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by the Company of U.S. real
property interests. As a general matter, backup withholding and information
reporting will not apply to a payment of the proceeds of a sale of the Common
Stock by or through a foreign office of a foreign broker. Information
reporting (but not backup withholding) will apply, however, to a payment of
the proceeds of a sale of the Common Stock by a foreign office of a broker
that (i) is a United
 
                                      24
<PAGE>
 
States person, (ii) derives 50% or more of its gross income for certain
periods from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or (iii)
is a "controlled foreign corporation" for United States tax purposes, unless
the broker has documentary evidence in its records that the holder is a Non-
U.S. Stockholder and certain other conditions are satisfied, or the
stockholder otherwise establishes an exemption. Payment to or through a United
States office of a broker of the proceeds of a sale of the Common Stock is
subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the
stockholder certifies under penalties of perjury that the stockholder is a
Non- U.S. Stockholder or otherwise establishes an exemption. A Non-U.S.
Stockholder may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS.
 
  The Treasury Department issued final Regulations in October 1997 concerning
the withholding of tax and information reporting for certain amounts paid to
non-resident alien individuals and foreign corporations. These new withholding
rules alter the current withholding regime, and generally will be effective
for distributions made after December 31, 1999. Stockholders should consult
their tax advisors concerning the impact, if any, of these new Regulations on
their ownership of shares of the Common Stock.
 
 Other Tax Considerations
 
  The Company and its stockholders may be subject to state and local tax in
states and localities in which they do business or own property. The tax
treatment of the Company and the stockholders in such jurisdictions may differ
from the federal income tax treatment described above. Consequently,
stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of
state and local tax laws on their ownership of shares of the Common Stock.
 
Employees
 
  As of December 31, 1998, the Company had seven full-time employees. The
Company considers its relationship with its employees to be good.
 
Insurance
 
  The Company maintains, or causes its operators to maintain, appropriate
liability and casualty insurance on its assets and operations. Under the
Master Leases, Vencor is required to maintain, at its expense, certain
insurance coverages related to the properties under the Master Leases and
Vencor's operations at the related facilities. See "Relationship with Vencor--
Master Lease Agreements with Vencor." There can be no assurance that Vencor
will maintain such insurance and any failure by Vencor to do so could have a
material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition
of the Company and on the ability of the Company to meet the terms of its
credit agreements and could prevent the Company from paying dividends to its
stockholders as required to maintain its status as a REIT.
 
  The Company believes that its insurance protection is adequate in amount and
coverage. There can be no assurance that in the future such insurance will be
available at a reasonable price or that the Company will be able to maintain
adequate levels of insurance coverage.

<PAGE>
 
                                 RISK FACTORS
 
Going Concern
 
  Because the operations of Vencor have been negatively impacted by changes in
reimbursement rates, by its current level of indebtedness and by certain other
factors, and because of the potential effect of such events on Vencor's
ability to meet its rent obligations to the Company, the Company's auditors
have included an explanatory paragraph in its report to the Company's
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1998 that
expresses substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern. See "Business--Recent Developments," "--Government Regulation," and
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations." The inclusion of the explanatory paragraph regarding the ability
of the Company to continue as a going concern could have a material adverse
effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the Company and
on the ability of the Company to meet the terms of its credit agreements.
 
Dependence of the Company on Vencor
 
  The Company leases substantially all its properties to Vencor and,
therefore, Vencor is the primary source of the Company's revenues. Vencor's
financial condition and ability to meet its rent obligations will determine
the Company's revenues and its ability to service its indebtedness and to make
distributions to its stockholders. In addition, any failure by Vencor to
conduct its operations effectively could have a material adverse effect on its
business reputation and on its ability to enlist or maintain patients in its
facilities. There can be no assurance that Vencor will have sufficient assets,
income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under
the Master Leases. Since the Company derives approximately 98.7% of its
revenue from Vencor and since the Master Leases are triple-net leases under
which Vencor is responsible for all insurance, taxes and maintenance and
repair expenses required in connection with the leased properties, the
inability of Vencor to satisfy its obligations under the Master Leases would
have a material adverse effect on the condition of the leased properties, as
well as on the results of operations and financial condition of the Company
and on the ability of the Company to meet the terms of its credit agreements,
and could prevent the Company from paying dividends to its stockholders as
required to maintain its status as a REIT. In addition, the credit standing of
the Company is affected by the general creditworthiness of Vencor.
 
  Due to the Company's dependence on Vencor's rental payments as the primary
source of the Company's revenues, the Company may be negatively affected by
enforcing its rights under the Master Leases or by terminating a Master Lease.
If Vencor fails to comply with the terms of a Master Lease or to comply with
applicable healthcare regulations and, in either case, Vencor or its lenders
fail to cure such default within the specified cure period, the Company may
have to find another lessee/operator for the properties covered by one or all
of the Master Leases. While the Company is attempting to locate one or more
lessee/operators there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments by
Vencor. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to locate
another suitable lessee/operator or that if the Company is successful in
locating such an operator, that the rental payments from such new operator
would not be materially less than the existing rental payments. The ability of
the Company to locate another suitable lessee/operator may be materially
delayed or limited by various state licensing, receivership, CON or other
laws, as well as by Medicare and Medicaid change of ownership rules.
 
  In addition, pursuant to the Reorganization, the Company assigned to Vencor
and Vencor assumed leases, and the rights, obligations and duties as a tenant
thereunder, to seven long-term acute care hospitals and 76 nursing centers
(the "Third Party Leases"), as well as certain third party guarantees (the
"Third Party Guarantees"). The rent obligation under the Third Party Leases
for the 1999 fiscal year is expected to be approximately $39.2 million. See
Note 8 to Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with these
assignments, the Company remained primarily liable for substantially all of
the obligations under the Third Party Leases and the Third Party Guarantees.
Vencor has indemnified the Company for any losses, claims, liabilities and the
like which may be incurred by or asserted against the Company in connection
with the Third Party Leases and the Third Party Guarantees. There can be no
assurance that Vencor will have sufficient assets, income and access to
financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the arrangements or
the indemnification. If Vencor
 
                                      26
<PAGE>
 
is unable to satisfy such obligations, the Company will be obligated to
satisfy the Third Party Lease obligations and the Third Party Guarantees. The
Company's performance of these obligations could have a material adverse
effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the Company and
on the ability of the Company to meet the terms of its credit agreements and
could prevent the Company from paying dividends to its stockholders as
required to maintain its status as a REIT.
 
  In connection with the Reorganization, Vencor agreed to assume and to
indemnify the Company for any and all liabilities that may arise out of the
ownership or operation of the healthcare operations either before or after the
date of the Reorganization. The indemnification provided by Vencor also covers
losses, including costs and expenses, which may arise from any future claims
asserted against the Company based on these healthcare operations. In
addition, at the time of the Reorganization, Vencor agreed to assume the
defense, on behalf of the Company, of any claims that were pending at the time
of the Reorganization, and which arose out of the ownership or operation of
the healthcare operations. Vencor also agreed to defend, on behalf of the
Company, any claims asserted after the Reorganization which arise out of the
ownership and operation of the healthcare operations. There can be no
assurance that Vencor will have sufficient assets, income and access to
financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations incurred in connection with
the Reorganization. If Vencor is unable to satisfy the obligations under these
arrangements, then the Company will be liable for the payment and performance
of such obligations and will have to assume the defense of such claims. The
Company's performance of these obligations and/or the assumption of the
defense of such claims could have a material adverse effect on the results of
operations and financial condition of the Company and on the ability of the
Company to meet the terms of its credit agreement and could prevent the
Company from paying dividends to its stockholders as required to maintain its
status as a REIT.
 
  Vencor maintains insurance for certain professional liability claims and
losses through a wholly owned captive insurance company that insures the first
$2 million of claims and losses. Losses in excess of $2 million are insured
through unrelated commercial insurance carriers.
 
Lack of Operating History
 
  In connection with the Reorganization, the Company ceased being one of the
largest providers of long-term healthcare services and instead has limited its
activities to owning and acquiring real estate and real estate related assets.
With the exception of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, management has no
experience operating a REIT, and management has no experience in operating a
REIT in the healthcare industry. The Company has relied, and for the
foreseeable future will need to rely, on Vencor to generate sufficient cash
flow from its healthcare operations to enable Vencor to meet the rent
obligations under the Master Leases.
 
Substantial Leverage and Ability to Raise Capital
 
  The Company is highly leveraged and a substantial portion of its cash flow
from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on
indebtedness. The Company is substantially dependent upon lease payments from
Vencor to meet its interest expense and principal repayment obligations under
its current debt facilities. These obligations will need to be met before
distributions for any period are made to holders of Common Stock, except that
the Company is permitted under its credit agreements to make such
distributions as are necessary to maintain its status as a REIT. In addition,
the credit standing of the Company will be affected by the general
creditworthiness of Vencor.
 
 
                                      27
<PAGE>
 
  The Company has $275 million of indebtedness that matures on October 30,
1999. The Company will have to refinance the indebtedness, extend the maturity
date of such indebtedness, raise equity, liquidate assets to pay such
indebtedness, or implement a plan which includes a combination of the
foregoing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to
successfully implement such alternatives and any failure to do so could lead
to an event of default under the Company's indebtedness.
 
  Adverse economic conditions could cause the terms on which the Company can
obtain additional borrowings to become unfavorable. In such circumstances, if
the Company is in need of capital to repay indebtedness as it matures or to
otherwise finance indebtedness, the Company may be required to liquidate one
or more investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of
the maximum return on such investments, and which could result in adverse tax
consequences to the Company. In addition, certain healthcare regulations may
constrain the ability of the Company to sell assets. There can be no
assurances that the Company
 
                                     27--1
<PAGE>
 
will be able to meet its debt service obligations and, to the extent that it
cannot, the Company risks the loss of some or all of its assets.
 
Lack of Control Over Properties
 
  The Company is dependent on the ability of Vencor, as triple-net lessee
under the Master Leases, and its other lessees to manage and maintain the
leased properties. The Company may be unable to take action if it believes
Vencor is operating one of the leased properties inefficiently or in a manner
adverse to the Company's interests, unless a specific material default exists
under a Master Lease. In the case of such a default, the Company's redress may
be limited to terminating the applicable Master Lease and seeking to recover
damages from Vencor. See "--Relationship with Vencor--Master Lease
Agreements." In such event, the Company would have to locate a suitable
lessee/operator for the property under the applicable Master Lease. There can
be no assurance that the Company will be able to locate another suitable
lessee/operator or that if the Company is successful in locating such an
operator, that the rental payments from such new operator would not be
materially less than the existing rental payments. In addition, the ability of
the Company to locate another suitable lessee/operator may be materially
delayed or limited by various state licensing, receivorship, CON or other
laws, as well as Medicare and Medicaid change of ownership rules.
 
Conflicts of Interest
 
  While the Company believes that the terms of the Master Leases and the other
agreements with Vencor reflect terms that would have been obtained in arm's
length negotiations, the Company and Vencor may be subject to conflicts of
interest and loyalties when enforcing such terms. Because of the pre-existing
and continuing ownership interests and interrelationships between certain
members of management and directors of the Company and Vencor, there may be
conflicts of interest and loyalties with respect to the ongoing operations of
the Company and Vencor. W. Bruce Lunsford is currently Chairman of the Board
of the Company and was Chief Executive Officer of the Company until December
1998. Mr. Lunsford was also Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
of Vencor through January 1999 and President of Vencor through November 1998.
Currently, however, there are no common members of management or common
directors. In the event that the Master Leases or other agreements are not
enforced on an arm's length basis, the Company's results of operations could
be affected adversely. There can be no assurance that the enforcement of the
terms of such agreements will occur in a manner similar to that which would
occur between unrelated parties, although the Independent Committee of the
Company's Board of Directors has taken and will continue to take steps to
ensure arm's length enforcement by the Company of all agreements with Vencor.
 
Healthcare Industry Risks
 
 Dependence on Healthcare Industry
 
  Because all of the properties are used as healthcare facilities, the Company
is directly affected by the risks associated with the healthcare industry. The
ability of Vencor and the Company's other tenants and operators to generate
profits and pay rent under their leases may be adversely affected by such
risks. See "Business-- Governmental Regulation."
 
  Vencor and the other lessees derive a substantial portion of their net
operating revenues from third-party payors, including the Medicare and
Medicaid programs. Such programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent
and substantial changes. The Budget Act is intended to reduce the increase in
Medicare payments by $115 billion and reduce the increase in Medicaid payments
by $13 billion between 1998 through 2002 and made extensive changes in the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, private payors, including managed
care payors, increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures and the
assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk
of operating a healthcare facility. Efforts to impose greater discounts and
more stringent cost controls by private payors are expected to continue. There
can be no assurances that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be
available for services to be provided by Vencor and other lessees which
 
                                      28
<PAGE>
 
are currently being reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or private payors.
Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement
rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity,
financial condition and results of operations of Vencor and other lessees.
 
 Extensive Regulation
 
  The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local
laws and regulations including, but not limited to, laws and regulations
relating to licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities,
addition of facilities, services, prices for services and billing for
services. These laws authorize periodic inspections and investigations, and
deficiencies which if not corrected can result in sanctions which include loss
of licensure to operate and loss of rights to participate in the Medicare and
Medicaid programs. Regulatory agencies have substantial powers to affect the
actions of operators of the Company's properties if the agencies believe that
there is an imminent threat to patient welfare, and in some state these powers
can include assumption of interim control over facilities through
receiverships. The Anti-kickback Laws prohibit certain business practices and
relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services
reimbursable under Medicare and Medicaid, including the payment or receipt of
remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid by Medicare
or other governmental programs. Sanctions for violating the Anti-kickback Laws
include criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and possible
exclusion from government programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
In the ordinary course of its business, the Company's operators are subject
regularly to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state
agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. See "Business--Governmental
Regulation."
 
  The Company is unable to predict the future course of federal, state and
local regulation or legislation, including Medicare and Medicaid statutes and
regulations. Changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse
effect on the operators' results of operations, financial condition, and their
ability to make rental payments to the Company.
 
  In the event that any operator of the Company's properties fails to make
rental payments to the Company or to comply with the applicable healthcare
regulations and, in either case, such,operators or their lendors fail to cure
the default prior to the expiration of the applicable cure period, the ability
of the Company to evict that operator and substitute another operator or
operators may be materially delayed or limited by various state licensing,
receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by Medicare and Medicaid change-
of-ownership rules. Such delays and limitations could have a material adverse
effect on the Company's ability to collect rent, to obtain possession of
leased properties, or otherwise to exercise remedies for tenant default. In
addition, the Company may also incur substantial additional expenses in
connection with any such licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership
proceedings.
 
 Healthcare Reform
 
  Healthcare is one of the largest industries in the United States and
continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention. The
Budget Act, enacted in August 1997, contains extensive changes to the Medicare
and Medicaid programs intended to reduce the projected amount of increase in
payments under those programs by $115 billion and $13 billion, respectively,
between 1998 and 2002. Under the Budget Act, annual growth rates for Medicare
will be reduced from over 10% to approximately 7.5% for the period between
1998 and 2002 based on specific program baseline projections from the last
five years. Virtually all spending reductions will come from healthcare
operators and changes in program components.
 
  The Budget Act reduced payments made to the hospitals operated by Vencor by
reducing incentive payments pursuant to TEFRA, allowable costs for capital
expenditures and bad debts, and payments for services to patients transferred
from a PPS hospital. The reductions in allowable costs for capital
expenditures became effective October 1, 1997. The reductions in the TEFRA
incentive payments and allowable costs for bad debts became effective between
May 1, 1998 and September 1, 1998 with respect to the Company's hospitals. The
reductions for payments for services to patients transferred from a PPS
hospital became effective October 1, 1998. The Budget Act also established
Nursing Center PPS for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1,
1998. During a nursing center's first three cost reporting periods under
Nursing Center PPS, the per diem rates will be based on a blend of facility-
specific costs and federal costs. Thereafter, the per diem rates will be
 
                                      29
<PAGE>
 
based solely on federal costs. The rates for such services were published by
HCFA in the Federal Register on May 12, 1998. The payments received under
Nursing Center PPS cover all services for Medicare patients, including all
ancillary services, such as respiratory therapy, physical therapy,
occupational therapy, speech therapy and certain covered drugs. The payments
that Vencor is receiving under Nursing Center PPS are substantially less than
before enactment of the Budget Act. Vencor has been subject to Nursing Center
PPS since July 1, 1998.
 
  The Budget Act established the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future
of Medicare, which held its first meeting on March 6, 1998, and charged it
with reviewing and analyzing financial conditions of Medicare, identifying
problems that threaten the financial integrity of the Medicare Trust Fund, and
making recommendations to address the program's long-term financing
challenges. This Commission recently concluded its deliberations without
making an official recommendation, but proposals considered by the commission
are now under independent consideration by the Congress. The Budget Act also
afforded states more flexibility in administering their Medicaid plans,
including the ability to shift most Medicaid enrollees into managed care plans
without first obtaining a federal waiver. Accordingly, the Medicare and
Medicaid programs, including payment levels and methods, are in a state of
change and are less predictable than before enactment of the Budget Act.
 
  There can be no assurance that the Budget Act, future healthcare legislation
or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental
healthcare programs will not have a material adverse effect on the liquidity,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company's operators which
could have a material adverse effect on their ability to make rental payments
to the Company.
 
Implementation of Original Business Strategy
 
  At the time of the Reorganization, the business strategy of the Company was
to diversify itself from its Vencor tenant concentration. However, current
conditions have impeded this strategy. If and when Vencor has stabilized its
financial condition and the Company has resolved its short-term debt
maturities, the Company intends to re-implement its original business
strategy. Accordingly, if the Company does begin to pursue acquisitions or
development of additional healthcare or other properties, it may encounter
certain risks and/or financing constraints. Acquisitions entail general
investment risk associated with any real estate investments, including risks
that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations, the
estimates of the cost of improvements necessary for acquired properties will
prove inaccurate, and the inability of the lessee/operator to meet performance
expectations. The Company does not presently contemplate any development
projects, although if the Company were to pursue new development projects,
such projects would be subject to numerous risks, including risks of
construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs, new
project commencement risks such as receipt of zoning, occupancy and other
required governmental approvals and permits and the incurrence of development
costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion. The fact
that the Company must distribute 95% of its net taxable income in order to
maintain its qualification as a REIT may limit the Company's ability to rely
upon rental payments from its properties or subsequently acquired properties
to finance acquisitions or new developments. As a result, if debt or equity
financing is not available on acceptable terms, further acquisitions or
development activities might be curtailed or cash available for distribution
would be affected adversely.
 
  The Company competes for investment opportunities with entities that have
substantially greater financial resources than the Company. The Company's
ability to compete successfully for such opportunities is affected by many
factors, including the cost to the Company of obtaining debt and equity
capital at rates comparable to or better than its competitors. Competition
generally may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available
to the Company and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to
sell, thereby impeding the implementation of the Company's business strategy.
 
Risks Associated with REIT Status
 
 Failure to Qualify
 
  If the Company does not make an election to be taxed as a REIT because it
cannot meet the applicable requirements for REIT qualification, the Company
will be subject to tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on
its taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders
will not be deductible by the Company, nor will they be required to be made.
To the extent of current and accumulated
 
                                      30
<PAGE>
 
earnings and profits, all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as
ordinary income, and, subject to certain limitations in the Code, corporate
stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction. If the
Company does not make an election to be taxed as a REIT with respect to the
current taxable year (1999), it will not for that reason be prevented from
making an election to be taxed as a REIT with respect to any subsequent
taxable year.
 
  If the Company elects to be taxed as a REIT and that election is revoked or
terminated (e.g., due to a failure to meet the REIT qualification tests), the
Company and its stockholders generally would be subject to the same tax
consequences that are described in the preceding paragraph in the taxable year
in which the Company ceased to qualify as a REIT. In addition, the Company
would be prohibited from re-electing REIT status for the four taxable years
following the year during which the Company ceased to qualify as a REIT,
unless certain relief provisions of the Code applied. It is impossible to
predict whether the Company would be entitled to such statutory relief.
 
 Inability to Maintain Required Distributions
 
  The Company is required to make distributions to its stockholders to comply
with the 95% distribution requirement and to avoid the nondeductible excise
tax. See "Business--Federal Income Tax Considerations--Annual Distribution
Requirements." The Company's funds from operations will be generated primarily
by rental income from the Master Leases. Differences in timing between taxable
income and cash flow could require the Company to borrow funds on a short-term
basis to meet the 95% distribution requirement. The Company's debt facilities
may restrict the ability of the Company to incur additional indebtedness under
certain circumstances, thereby preventing the Company from borrowing funds in
order to make such distributions. In addition, the failure of Vencor to make
rental payments under the Master Leases would impair materially the ability of
the Company to make distributions. Consequently, there can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to make distributions at the required
distribution rate or any other rate.
 
Potential Liabilities Due to Fraudulent Transfer Considerations and Legal
Dividend Requirements
 
  The Reorganization and the simultaneous distribution of the Vencor common
stock to the Ventas stockholders (the "Distribution") are subject to review
under state fraudulent conveyance laws, and in the event of a bankruptcy
proceeding, federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Under these laws, if a court
in a lawsuit by an unpaid creditor or a representative of creditors (such as a
trustee or debtor-in-possession in bankruptcy of the Company or any of its
respective subsidiaries) were to determine that, as of the Reorganization, the
Company did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for
distributing the stock distributed in the Distribution and, at the time of the
Distribution, the Company or any of its subsidiaries (i) was insolvent or was
rendered insolvent, (ii) had unreasonably small capital with which to carry on
its business and all businesses in which it intended to engage, or (iii)
intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to
repay such debts as they would mature, then such court could order the holders
of the stock distributed in the Distribution to return the value of the stock
and any dividends paid thereon, bar future dividend and redemption payments on
the stock, and invalidate, in whole or in part, the Distribution as a
fraudulent conveyance.
 
  In addition, the Distribution is subject to review under state corporate
distribution and dividend statutes. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not
pay a dividend to its stockholders if (i) the net assets of the corporation do
not exceed its capital, unless the amount proposed to be paid as a dividend is
less than the corporation's net profits for the current and/or preceding
fiscal year in which the dividend is to be paid, or (ii) the capital of the
corporation is less than the aggregate amount allocable to all classes of its
preferred stock.
 
  The Company believes that (i) the Company and each of its subsidiaries were
solvent (in accordance with the foregoing definitions) at the time of
Distribution, were able to repay their debts as they matured following the
Reorganization and the Distribution and had sufficient capital to carry on
their respective businesses and (ii) the Distribution was made entirely in
compliance with Delaware Law.
 
                                      31
<PAGE>
 
There is no certainty, however, that a court would reach the same conclusions
in determining whether the Company was insolvent at the time of, or after
giving effect to, the Reorganization and the Distribution or whether lawful
funds were available for the Distribution.
 
  The agreement between the Company and Vencor pursuant to which the
Reorganization was effected (the "Reorganization Agreement") and certain of
the ancillary agreements to the Reorganization Agreement provide for the
allocation, immediately prior to the Distribution, of certain debt of the
Company. Further, pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, from and after the
date of the Reorganization and the Distribution, each of the Company and
Vencor is responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related
to the businesses which it owns and operates following the consummation of the
Reorganization and the Distribution. It is possible that a court would
disregard the allocation agreed to among the parties, and require the Company
or Vencor to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to the other,
particularly if the other were to refuse or to be unable to pay or perform the
subject allocated obligations.
 
Unasserted Claims
 
  During the Company's discussions with Vencor, Vencor has asserted various
potential claims against the Company arising out of the Reorganization. The
Company intends to vigorously defend these claims if they are asserted in a
legal or mediation proceeding. If these claims were to prevail, it could have
material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition
of the Company and on the ability of the Company to meet the terms of its
credit agreement and could prevent the Company from paying dividends to its
stockholders required to maintain its status as a REIT.
 
Effects of Bankruptcy Proceedings
 
  The Company's ability to manage its assets and operations is subject to
state laws that limit creditors' rights and remedies available to real
property owners to collect delinquent rents, and with respect to tenants of
the Company who are subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, to federal bankruptcy
laws. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection, the tenant, including
without limitation, Vencor, will have an obligation to pay rent to the Company
as landlord during the pendancy of the proceeding. The tenant will also have
the right to assume or reject any real property lease to which the tenant is a
party. If the tenant assumes a real property lease, it must do so pursuant to
the original contract terms and it must cure all pre-petition and all post-
petition defaults under the lease. If the tenant rejects a real property
lease, the Company may lease the property to another tenant. If a tenant
becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy protection, there can be no
assurances that the Company will be able to timely recover the premises from
the tenant or from a trustee or debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy
proceeding relating to that tenant. There can also be no assurances that the
Company will receive rent in the proceeding equal to the amount set forth in
the leases or sufficient to cover the Company's expenses with respect to the
premises. If a tenant becomes subject to bankruptcy protection, the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code will apply, which may restrict the amount and recoverability
of the Company's claims against the tenant. These proceedings could have a
material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition
of the Company and on the ability of the Company to meet the terms of its
credit agreements and could prevent the Company from paying dividends to its
stockholders as required to maintain its status as a REIT.
 
  If Vencor were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case commenced under the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, then Vencor as a debtor in possession or any trustee
appointed for it could seek to avoid transfers made and obligations incurred
as part of the Reorganization. Under fraudulent transfer laws, such transfers
and obligations could be avoided if they were made or incurred with the actual
intent to delay, hinder or defraud creditors. They also could be avoided if,
as of the Reorganization, Vencor did not receive fair consideration or
reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfers and obligations made
and incurred by it and, at the time of the Reorganization, Vencor (i) was
insolvent or was rendered insolvent, (ii) had unreasonably small capital with
which to carry on its business and all businesses in which it intended to
engage, or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond
its ability to repay such debts as they would mature.
 
                                      32
<PAGE>
 
  The Company believes that Vencor was solvent (in accordance with the
foregoing definitions) at the time of Reorganization, was able to repay its
debts as they matured following the Reorganization and had sufficient capital
to carry on its business. Moreover, the Company at the time of the
Reorganization received third party opinions as to Vencor's solvency and the
adequacy of Vencor's capitalization. There is no certainty, however, that a
court would reach the same conclusions in determining whether Vencor was
insolvent or adequately capitalized at the time of, or after giving effect to,
the Reorganization.
 
Item 2. Properties
 
  The Company believes that it has a high quality portfolio of healthcare
facilities, diversified in terms of geography and healthcare services provided
at such facilities. The Company believes that the geographic diversity of the
leased properties makes the portfolio less susceptible to adverse changes in
state regulation and regional economic downturns. The long-term acute care
hospitals owned by the Company primarily provide long-term acute care to
medically complex, chronically ill patients, covering approximately 4,194 beds
in 45 hospitals. The nursing centers owned by the Company are leading
providers of rehabilitation services, including physical, occupational and
speech therapies, and care for patients with Alzheimer's disease, covering
approximately 28,492 beds in 219 nursing centers. The personal care facilities
owned by the Company provide services including supporting living services,
neurorehabilitation, neurobehavioral management and vocational programs,
covering approximately 136 beds in eight centers.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings
 
  The following litigation and other matters arose from the Company's
operations prior to the Reorganization. In connection with the Reorganization,
Vencor agreed to assume the defense, on behalf of the Company, of any claims
that were pending at the time of the Reorganization and which arose out of the
ownership or operation of the healthcare operations. Vencor also agreed to
defend, on behalf of the Company, any claims asserted after the Reorganization
which arose out of the ownership and operation of the healthcare operations.
However, there can be no assurance that Vencor will continue to defend the
Company in such proceedings and actions or that Vencor will have sufficient
assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy such
indemnification obligations or its obligations incurred in connection with the
Reorganization. In addition, the following descriptions are based on
information provided to the Company by Vencor. Because the Company and Vencor
have been unable to agree to date on acceptable terms for the sharing of
certain information, the Company has not been able to and has not conducted an
independent investigation to verify the facts surrounding these proceedings or
actions.
 
  On October 21, 1998, Vencor was notified by HCFA Administrator in Chicago,
Illinois and the State of Wisconsin that the Medicare and Medicaid
certification for its 657-bed skilled nursing facility known as Mt. Carmel
Health & Rehabilitation Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (the "Facility") would
be terminated effective November 6, 1998. The State of Wisconsin Department of
Health and Family Services also informed Vencor that the Facility's license
would be terminated as of February 13, 1999. The Facility appealed that
termination. These actions resulted from the Facility's failure to attain
substantial compliance with federal and state requirements by an October 12,
1998 deadline. On November 6, 1998, Vencor filed an action against HCFA in
Federal District Court in Washington, D.C. and obtained an order enjoining
HCFA and its agents, including the State of Wisconsin, from terminating the
Facility's certification and from relocating any of the Facility's
 
                                      40
<PAGE>
 
residents. That case was dismissed after Vencor reached agreements with state
and federal authorities to settle all fines and penalties and extend the
threatened certification termination date to January 29, 1999. Vencor has paid
state and federal fines totaling $500,000. On January 29, 1999, the Facility
was determined to be in substantial compliance with federal and state
requirements, which removed the threat of Medicare and Medicaid
decertification. On January 29, 1999, the Facility's license and operations
were transferred to Benedictine Health Dimensions ("BHD"), an unrelated
entity, under a management agreement with Vencor. There was no reduction in
the rent under the applicable Master Lease in connection with the transfer of
the licenses and operations to BHD, and Vencor remains primarily liable for
the payment of the full rental amount and the performance of all the tenant's
obligations under the applicable Master Lease. Vencor pays BHD a management
fee under the management agreement.
 
  On April 7, 1998, the Circuit Court of the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit for
Hillsborough County, Florida, issued a temporary injunction order against the
Company's nursing center in Tampa, Florida (which was subsequently transferred
to Vencor in the Reorganization), which ordered the nursing center to cease
notifying and requiring the discharge of any resident. The Company
discontinued requiring the discharge of any resident from its Tampa nursing
center on April 7, 1998. Following the conduct of a complaint survey at the
facility, the State of Florida Agency for Health Care Administration ("AHCA")
imposed a fine of $270,000 for related regulatory violations. In addition,
HCFA imposed a fine of $113,000. Vencor, on behalf of the Company, appealed
both the AHCA and HCFA fines and has settled both appeals for a total of
$370,000. Vencor, on behalf of the Company, submitted an acceptable plan of
correction at the Tampa nursing center and was informed by AHCA that
"immediate jeopardy" no longer existed. The threatened termination of the
Tampa nursing center's Medicare provider agreement also was reversed. The
temporary injunction order has been dissolved, and that legal action has been
dismissed.
 
  The Tampa Prosecuting Attorney's office has indicated to Vencor that it was
conducting an independent criminal investigation into the circumstances
surrounding the Tampa resident discharges. Vencor cooperated fully with this
investigation and has been informed that no action will be taken against
Vencor.
 
  Vencor received notice in June 1998 that the State of Georgia found
regulatory violations with respect to patient discharges, among other things,
at one of Vencor's nursing centers in Savannah, Georgia. The state recommended
a federal fine of $543,000 for these violations, which HCFA has imposed.
Vencor has appealed this fine.
 
  The HCFA Administrator of the Medicare and Medicaid programs indicated in
April 1998 that the operations at the Company's facilities in other states
also are being monitored.
 
  On April 9, 1998, a class action lawsuit captioned Mongiovi et al. v.
Vencor, Inc., et al., Case No. 98-769-CIV-T24E, was filed in the United States
District Court for the Middle District of Florida on behalf of a purported
class consisting of certain residents of the Tampa nursing center and other
residents in the Company's nursing centers nationwide (which were subsequently
transferred to Vencor in the Reorganization). The complaint alleges various
breaches of contract, and statutory and regulatory violations including
violations of federal and state RICO statutes. The original complaint has been
amended to delineate several purported subclasses. The plaintiffs seek class
certification, unspecified damages, attorneys' fees and costs. Vencor, on
behalf of the Company, is defending this action vigorously.
 
  A class action lawsuit entitled A. Carl Helwig v. Vencor, Inc., et al., was
filed on December 24, 1997 in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Kentucky (Civil Action No. 3-97CV-8354). The class action claims
were brought by an alleged stockholder of the Company against the Company and
certain executive officers and directors of the Company. The complaint alleges
that the Company and certain current and former executive officers of the
Company during a specified time frame violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Exchange Act, by, among other things, issuing to the investing public a series
of false and misleading statements concerning the Company's current operations
and the inherent value of the Company's common stock. The complaint further
alleges that as a result of these purported false and misleading statements
concerning the Company's revenues and successful acquisitions, the price of
the Company's common stock was artificially
 
                                      41
<PAGE>
 
inflated. In particular, the complaint alleges that the Company issued false
and misleading financial statements during the first, second and third
calendar quarters of 1997 which misrepresented and understated the impact that
changes in Medicare reimbursement policies would have on the Company's core
services and profitability. The complaint further alleges that the Company
issued a series of materially false statements concerning the purportedly
successful integration of its recent acquisitions and prospective earnings per
share for 1997 and 1998 which the Company knew lacked any reasonable basis and
were not being achieved. The suit seeks damages in an amount to be proven at
trial, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, reasonable attorneys' fees,
expert witness fees and other costs, and any extraordinary equitable and/or
injunctive relief permitted by law or equity to assure that the plaintiff has
an effective remedy. On January 22, 1999, the court granted Vencor's motion,
acting on behalf of the Company, to dismiss the case. The plaintiff has
appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit. Vencor, on behalf of the Company, is defending this action
vigorously.
 
  A stockholder derivative suit entitled Thomas G. White on behalf of Vencor,
Inc. and Ventas, Inc. v. W. Bruce Lunsford, et al., Case No. 98CI03669, was
filed in June 1998 in the Jefferson County, Kentucky, Circuit Court. The suit
was brought on behalf of Vencor and the Company against certain current and
former executive officers and directors of Vencor and the Company. The
complaint alleges that the defendants damaged the Vencor and the Company by
engaging in violations of the securities laws, engaging in insider trading,
fraud and securities fraud and damaging the reputation of Vencor and the
Company. The plaintiff asserts that such actions were taken deliberately, in
bad faith and constitute breaches of the defendants' duties of loyalty and due
care. The complaint is based on substantially similar assertions to those made
in the class action lawsuit entitled A. Carl Helwig v. Vencor, Inc., et al.,
discussed above. The suit seeks unspecified damages, interest, punitive
damages, reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees and other costs, and
any extraordinary equitable and/or injunctive relief permitted by law or
equity to assure that Vencor and the Company have an effective remedy. Vencor
and the Company each believe that the allegations in the complaint are without
merit and Vencor, on behalf of the Company, intends to defend this action
vigorously.
 
  A class action lawsuit entitled Jules Brody v. Transitional Hospital
Corporation, et al., Case No. CV-S-97-00747-PMP, was filed on June 19, 1997 in
the United States District Court for the District of Nevada on behalf of a
class consisting of all persons who sold shares of Transitional common stock
during the period from February 26, 1997 through May 4, 1997, inclusive. The
complaint alleges that Transitional purchased shares of its common stock from
members of the investing public after it had received a written offer to
acquire all of Transitional's common stock and without making the required
disclosure that such an offer had been made. The complaint further alleges
that defendants disclosed that there were "expressions of interest" in
acquiring Transitional when, in fact, at that time, the negotiations had
reached an advanced stage with actual firm offers at substantial premiums to
the trading price of Transitional's stock having been made which were actively
being considered by Transitional's Board of Directors. The complaint asserts
claims pursuant to Sections 10(b), 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and
common law principles of negligent misrepresentation and names as defendants
Transitional as well as certain former senior executives and directors of
Transitional. The plaintiff seeks class certification, unspecified damages,
attorneys' fees and costs. On June 18, 1998, the court granted Vencor's
motion, acting on behalf of the Company, to dismiss with leave to amend the
Section 10(b) claim and the state law claims for misrepresentation. The court
denied Vencor's motion to dismiss the Section 14(e) and Section 20(a) claims.
Vencor, on behalf of the Company, has filed a motion for reconsideration and
intends to defend vigorously this action.
 
  Vencor's subsidiary, American X-Rays, Inc. ("AXR"), which was previously a
subsidiary of the Company, is the defendant in a civil qui tam lawsuit which
was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Arkansas and served on the Company on July 7, 1997. The United States
Department of Justice has intervened in the suit which was brought under the
Federal Civil False Claims Act. AXR provided portable X-ray services to
nursing facilities (including those operated by the Company) and other
healthcare providers. The Company acquired an interest in AXR when Hillhaven
was merged into the Company in September 1995 and purchased the remaining
interest in AXR in February 1996. The civil law suit alleges that AXR
submitted false claims to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The suit seeks
damages in an amount of not less than
 
                                      42
<PAGE>
 
$1,000,000, treble damages and civil penalties. In a related criminal
investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of
Arkansas indicted four former employees of AXR; those individuals were
convicted of various fraud related counts in January 1999. AXR had been
informed previously that it was not a target of the criminal investigation,
and AXR was not indicted. Vencor, on behalf of the Company, cooperated fully
in the criminal investigation. Vencor, on behalf of the Company, is defending
vigorously the qui tam action.
 
  On June 6, 1997, Transitional announced that it had been advised that it was
the target of a federal grand jury investigation being conducted by the United
States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts arising from
activities of Transitional's formerly owned dialysis business. The
investigation involves an alleged illegal arrangement in the form of a
partnership which existed from June 1987 to June 1992 between Damon
Corporation and Transitional. Transitional spun off its dialysis business, now
called Vivra, Incorporated, on September 1, 1989. In January 1998, the Company
was informed that no criminal charges would be filed against the Company. In
March 1998, the Company was added as a defendant to a previously pending qui
tam lawsuit against the other partners related to the partnerships' former
Medicare billing practices. Vencor, on behalf of the Company, is vigorously
defending the action.
 
  Vencor's subsidiary, TheraTx, which was previously a subsidiary of the
Company, was a defendant and counterclaimant in an action pending in state
court in Jacksonville, Florida entitled Highland Pines Nursing Center, Inc.,
et al. v. TheraTx, Incorporated, et al. The plaintiffs claimed that they were
entitled to up to $40 million in earnout compensation from TheraTx's purchase
of several businesses from the plaintiffs in 1995 and to damages from related
tort claims. TheraTx asserted fraud counterclaims against the plaintiffs
relating to the original purchase. This case, along with other pending claims
between TheraTx and the various plaintiffs, was settled in January 1999 by
TheraTx's payment of $16.2 million in cash and other consideration to the
plaintiffs. All legal actions between the parties have been dismissed pursuant
to the settlement.
 
  Vencor has been informed by the U.S. Department of Justice that it is the
subject of ongoing investigations into various aspects of its Medicare billing
practices. This investigation also includes the Company's healthcare
operations prior to the date of the Reorganization. Vencor is cooperating
fully in the investigations.
 
  Vencor is a party to certain legal actions and regulatory investigations
arising in the normal course of its business. Neither the Company nor Vencor
is able to predict the ultimate outcome of pending litigation and regulatory
investigations. In addition, there can be no assurance that HCFA or other
regulatory agencies will not initiate additional investigations related to
Vencor's business in the future, nor can there be any assurance that the
resolution of any litigation or investigations, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on Vencor's liquidity,
financial position or results of operations, which in turn could have a
material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition
of the Company and on the ability of the Company to meet the terms of its
credit agreements and could prevent the Company from paying dividends to its
stockholders as required to maintain its status as a REIT.

  The Company declared its first dividend of $0.39 per share on January 13,
1999 payable to stockholders of record on January 29, 1999. The Company
currently intends to make distributions to its stockholders on a quarterly
basis and anticipates that its quarterly dividends will be equal to a payout
ratio of approximately 80% of funds from operations (the "Distribution
Policy"). There can be no assurances that the Company will meet or maintain
its Distribution Policy. See "Business--Risk Factors."
 
  The Company's Distribution Policy and the frequency and amounts of any
dividends could be affected by an adverse change in the results of operations
of the Company, an adverse change in economic conditions affecting the
Company's business or the business of Vencor and the other operators of its
properties or adverse changes in market and competitive factors that the
Company's Board deems relevant in setting a distribution policy. In
particular, any nonpayment of rent by Vencor under the Master Leases, or any
expectation that such nonpayment will occur in the future, would have a
material impact on the amount of the Company's distributions. Subject to
restrictions under the Company's debt facilities and other obligations, the
Board, in its sole discretion, will determine the actual distribution amount
and rate.
 
  In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Company must make
annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 95% of its REIT taxable
income (which does not include net capital gains). Under certain
circumstances, the Company may be required to make distributions in excess of
funds from operations in order to meet such distribution requirements. In such
event, the Company presently would expect to borrow funds, or to sell assets
for cash, to the extent necessary to obtain cash sufficient to make the
distributions required to retain its qualification as a REIT for federal
income tax purposes, although there can be no assurance that the Company would
be successful in such efforts. Although the Company is currently expected to
qualify as a REIT for the year ending December 31, 1999, it is possible that
economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause the Company to
fail to qualify as a REIT. See "Business--Federal Income Tax Considerations--
Annual Distribution Requirements."

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations
 
  The following is a discussion of background information on the Company and a
discussion of the consolidated results of operations, financial position and
liquidity and capital resources of the Company, which should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes
thereto.
 
Background Information
 
  The Company has announced its intention to operate and be treated as a self-
administered, self-managed REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning
January 1, 1999. The Company is a real estate company that owns or leases 45
hospitals (comprised of two acute care hospitals and 43 long-term care
hospitals), 219 nursing centers and eight personal care facilities as of
December 31, 1998. The Company's portfolio of properties are located in 36
states and are leased and operated primarily by Vencor or its subsidiaries.
The Company conducts all of its business through a wholly owned operating
partnership,Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership.
 
  The Company was incorporated in Kentucky in 1983 as Vencare, Inc. and
commenced operations in 1985. It was reorganized as a Delaware corporation in
1987 and changed its name to Vencor, Incorporated in 1989 and to Vencor, Inc.
in 1993. On September 28, 1995, The Hillhaven Corporation merged with and into
the Company. On March 21, 1997, the Company acquired TheraTx, Incorporated, a
provider of subacute rehabilitation and respiratory therapy program management
services to nursing centers and an operator of 26 nursing centers. On June 24,
1997, the Company acquired Transitional Hospitals Corporation, an operator of
16 long-term acute care hospitals and three satellite facilities located in 13
states.
 
                                      46
<PAGE>
 
  On May 1, 1998, the Company effected the Reorganization pursuant to which
the Company was separated into two publicly held corporations. A new
corporation, subsequently renamed Vencor, Inc., was formed to operate the
hospital, nursing center and ancillary services businesses. Pursuant to the
terms of the Reorganization, the Company distributed the common stock of
Vencor to stockholders of record of the Company as of April 27, 1998. The
Company, through its subsidiaries, continued to hold title to substantially
all of the real property and to lease such real property to Vencor. At such
time, the Company also changed its name to Ventas, Inc. and refinanced
substantially all of its long-term debt. For financial reporting periods
subsequent to the Reorganization, the historical financial statements of the
Company were assumed by Vencor and the Company is deemed to have commenced
operations on May 1, 1998. Accordingly, the Company does not have comparable
financial results for prior periods. In addition, for certain reporting
purposes under this Form 10-K and other filings, the Commission treats the
Company as having commenced operations on May 1, 1998.
 
  The Company's principal objectives are to maximize funds from operations for
distribution to stockholders, to enhance capital growth through the
appreciation of the residual value of its portfolio of properties, and to
preserve and maintain the stockholders' capital.
 
Results of Operations
 
  Rental income for the eight months ended December 31, 1998 totaled $149.9
million, of which $147.9 million resulted from leases with Vencor. Income from
operations was $34.8 million, or $0.51 per share. The Company incurred an
extraordinary loss for the eight months of $8.1 million, or $0.12 per share,
net of income taxes, related to the extinguishment of debt. Net income for the
eight months was $26.8 million, or $0.39 per share.
 
  The Company considers funds from operations ("FFO") an appropriate measure
of performance of an equity REIT, and with the exception of non-cash
compensation expense, the Company uses the National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. Pro forma FFO assumes that the
Company qualified to be taxed as a REIT on May 1, 1998, and the provision for
income taxes was therefore excluded. Pro forma FFO is defined to mean net
income available to common stockholders determined in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), excluding income taxes,
gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of property, plus
depreciation of real estate assets and certain non-cash compensation expense.
FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other
real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use
the same definition. Pro forma FFO should not be considered as an alternative
to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the
Company's financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities
(determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity,
nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the
Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear
understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company,
pro forma FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented
in the consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere in this
Form 10-K.
 
  Pro forma FFO for the eight months ended December 31, 1998 are summarized in
the following table:

  On a pro forma basis, excluding the provision for income taxes based upon
the assumption that the Company qualified to be taxed as a REIT on May 1,
1998, FFO for the eight months would have totaled $84.8 million, or $1.25 per
share. Pro forma income from operations would have been $56.0 million, or
$0.82 per share. Rental income would not have changed on a pro forma basis for
the eight-month period.
 
  Interest expense includes interest of $53.9 million on the Company's Bank
Credit Agreement (described below), swap payments of $1.2 million on the
Company's interest rate swap agreement (described below) and $0.9 million of
interest on other obligations.
 
Asset/Liability Management
 
  Asset/liability management is a key element of the Company's overall risk
management program. The objective of asset/liability management is to support
the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk
levels. The asset/liability management process focuses on a variety of risks,
including market risk (primarily interest rate risk) and credit risk.
Effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the
absolute levels and variability of FFO and net worth. The following discussion
addresses the Company's integrated management of assets and liabilities,
including the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not
use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
 
 Market Risk
 
  The Company earns revenue by leasing its assets under long-term triple net
leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators,
subject to certain limitations. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. The Company's debt obligations are floating rate obligations whose
interest rate and related cash flows vary with the movement in the London
Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). See "--Liquidity and Capital Resources." The
general fixed nature of the Company's assets and the variable nature of the
Company's debt obligations creates interest rate risk. If interest rates were
to rise significantly, the Company's lease revenue might not be sufficient to
meet its debt obligations. In order to mitigate this risk, at or about the
date the Company spun off its healthcare operations under the Reorganization,
it also entered into interest rate swaps to convert most of its floating rate
debt obligations to fixed rate debt obligations. Interest rate swaps generally
involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments on an
underlying notional amount. As of December 31, 1998, the Company had $900
million of interest rate swaps outstanding with a highly rated counterparty in
which the Company pays a fixed rate of 5.985% to the counterparty and receives
LIBOR from the counterparty. When interest rates rise the interest rate swap
agreement increases in market value to the Company and when interest rates
fall the interest rate swap agreement declines in value to the Company. Since
the interest rate swap agreement was executed, interest rates have generally
been lower and the market value of the interest rate swap agreement has been
an unrealized loss to the Company. As of December 31, 1998, the interest rate
swap agreement was in an unrealized loss position to the Company of
approximately $39.2 million. To highlight the sensitivity of the interest rate
swap agreement to changes in interest rates the following summary shows the
effects of an instantaneous change of 100 basis points (BPS) in interest rates
as of December 31, 1998:

</TABLE>
 
  The terms of this interest rate swap agreement require that the Company make
a cash payment or otherwise post collateral, such as a letter of credit from
one of the banks identified in the Bank Credit Agreement to the counterparty
if the market value loss to the Company exceed certain levels (the "threshold
levels"). See "--Liquidity and Capital Resources." The threshold levels vary
based on the relationship between the Company's debt obligations and the
tangible fair market value of its assets as defined in the Bank Credit
Agreement. As of December 31, 1998, the threshold level under the interest
rate swap agreement was a market value loss of $35 million and the interest
rate swap agreement was in an unrealized loss position to the Company of $39.2
million. Under the interest rate swap agreement, if collateral must be posted,
the principal amount of
 
                                      48
<PAGE>
 
such collateral must equal the difference between the market value of the
interest rate swap at the time of such determination and the threshold amount.
As of December 31, 1998, the Company had a letter of credit outstanding as
posted collateral under the interest rate swap agreement in the amount of
$10.9 million, which reduced the availability of the Company's revolving line
of credit under its Bank Credit Agreement as of that date by a similar amount.
As of March 19, 1999, the market value unrealized loss of the interest rate
swap agreement had declined below the $35 million threshold to $15 million and
the letter of credit outstanding had been reduced to one dollar ($1). Under
the Bank Credit Agreement, the maximum amount that may be outstanding under
such letters of credit at anytime is $25 million.
 
 Credit Risk
 
  The Company monitors credit risk under its lease agreements with its lessees
by monitoring publicly available financial information, discussions with its
lessees and review of information otherwise available to the Company. Pursuant
to the Reorganization, the Company has a significant concentration of credit
risk under its four Master Lease Agreements with Vencor. For the eight months
ended December 31, 1998, lease revenues from Vencor comprised $147.9 million,
or approximately 98.7% of the Company's total lease revenues of $149.9
million. Accordingly, Vencor's financial condition and ability to meet its
rent obligations will determine the Company's revenues and its ability to make
distributions to its stockholders. The operations of Vencor have been
negatively impacted by changes in reimbursement rates, by its current level of
indebtedness and by certain other factors. See "Business--Recent Developments"
and "Business--Governmental Regulation." In addition, any failure by Vencor to
effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its
business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its
facilities. There can be no assurance that Vencor will have sufficient assets,
income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under
the Master Leases. Since the Company derives in excess of 98% of its revenues
from Vencor and since the Master Leases are triple-net leases under which
Vencor is responsible for all insurance, taxes and maintenance and repair
expenses required in connection with the leased properties, the inability of
Vencor to satisfy its obligations under the Master Leases would have a
material adverse effect on the condition of the leased properties, as well as
on the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company and on
the ability of the Company to meet the terms of the Bank Credit Agreement, and
could prevent the Company from paying dividends to its stockholders as
required to maintain its status as a REIT.

  In addition to diversification of lease revenues from geographic
diversification of the portfolio, the majority of the Company's facilities are
located in states which have certificate of need requirements. Certain states
require state approval for development and expansion of healthcare facilities
and services, including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare
facilities or services. A certificate of need ("CON"), which is issued by
governmental agencies with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities, is at
times required for expansion of existing facilities, construction of new
facilities, addition of beds, acquisition of major items of equipment or
introduction of new services. The CON rules and regulations may restrict an
operator's ability to expand the Company's properties in certain
circumstances.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
  Cash provided by operations totaled $86.8 million for the eight months ended
December 31, 1998. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $.9
million. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $85.5 million.
 
  In connection with the Reorganization, the Company refinanced substantially
all of its long-term debt. In connection with the refinancing arrangements,
the Company entered into a $1.2 billion bank credit agreement, dated April 29,
1998, with NationsBank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the "Bank Credit
Agreement") and retained approximately $6 million of prior debt obligations.
The Bank Credit Agreement comprises (i) a three year $250 million Revolving
Credit Facility priced at LIBOR plus 2 to 2 1/2% (the "Revolving Credit
Facility"), (ii) a $200 million Term A Loan payable in various installments
over three years priced at LIBOR plus 2 1/4 to 2 1/2%, (iii) a $350 million
Term B Loan payable in various installments over five years priced at LIBOR
plus 2 3/4 to 3%, and (iv) a $400 million loan due on October 30, 1999 priced
at LIBOR plus 2 3/4 to 3%. For the eight months ended December 31, 1998, the
Company paid $12 million in financing fees related to establishing the Bank
Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 1998, the outstanding balances under the
Bank Credit Agreement and related principal payments due in 1999 are as

a combination of the foregoing. However, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be successful in its efforts to pay down or refinance the $275
million loan and to meet its other liquidity requirements. As of March 19,
1999, the Company had outstanding borrowings and available borrowings under
its Revolving Credit Facility of $202.7 million and $47.3 million,
respectively. The $47.3 million is subject to certain restrictions under the
Bank Credit Agreement. In addition, as of March 19, 1999, cash and overnight
investments in banks totaled $65.8 million.
 
  The Company leases substantially all its properties to Vencor and,
therefore, Vencor is the primary source of the Company's revenues. Vencor's
financial condition and ability to satisfy its rent obligations under the
 
                                      51
<PAGE>
 
Master Leases will impact the Company's revenues and its ability to service
its indebtedness and to make distributions to its stockholders. Because the
operations of Vencor have been negatively impacted by changes in reimbursement
rates, by its current level of indebtedness and by certain other factors, and
because of the potential effect of such events on Vencor's ability to meet its
rent obligations to the Company, the Company's auditors have included an
explanatory paragraph in its report to the Company's consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 1998 that expresses substantial
doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The
existence of the explanatory paragraph may have a material adverse affect on
the Company's relationships with its creditors and could have a material
adverse affect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of
operations.
 
  Management has taken certain initiatives to address these issues. The
Company has retained Merrill Lynch & Co., as financial advisor, to assist it
in its review of Vencor's financial condition and its ability to comply with
the covenants in its bank credit facility. Merrill Lynch is also assisting the
Company in its review of alternatives to repaying the $275 million portion of
its credit facility that matures on October 30, 1999 and to assess other
strategic alternatives for the Company.
 
  The Company has increased its cash position so that it has cash and
overnight investment, in banks, totaling $65.8 million as of March 19, 1999.
 
  The Company and Vencor have discussed Vencor's recent results of operations
and Vencor's need to amend or restructure its existing indebtedness. In those
discussions, Vencor has requested interim rent concessions under the Master
Leases and the Company has rejected that request. The Company will consider
appropriate action to take in response to any further proposals by Vencor as
may be in the best interests of the Company. The Company has entered into an
agreement with Vencor whereby the Company has agreed not to exercise remedies
for non-payment of rent, which is due from Vencor on April 1, 1999, for a
period ending on April 12, 1999. During the Company's discussions with Vencor,
Vencor has asserted various potential claims against the Company arising out
of the Reorganization. The Company intends to vigorously defend these claims
if they are asserted in a legal mediation or proceeding.
 
  As of March 31, 1998, the Company was in compliance with the covenants
contained in the Bank Credit Agreement. Continued payment of rent by Vencor
under the Master Leases is essential to the Company's ability to remain in
compliance with the covenants contained in the Bank Credit Facility.
 
  In connection with the Reorganization, the Company entered into an interest
rate swap agreement to eliminate the impact of changes in interest rates on
its floating rate debt obligations. The agreement expires in varying amounts
through December 2006 and provides for the Company to pay a fixed rate at
5.985% and receive LIBOR (floating rate). The fair value of the swap agreement
is not recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements. See "--
Asset/Liability Management" and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
  In connection with the Reorganization, the Company sought to obtain
necessary consents to assign its former third party lease obligations to
Vencor. The Company has not and does not expect to receive consents for
assignments on one long-term care hospital and 16 nursing centers. The Company
remains primarily liable on substantially all lease obligations assigned to
Vencor, as well as certain third party guarantees. Vencor has contractually
indemnified the Company for these leases and guaranty obligations. See
"Business--Relationship with Vencor" and Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
 
  The Company loaned, with interest provisions, approximately $3.9 million to
certain former executive officers of the Company to finance the income taxes
payable by them as a result of the Reorganization. The loans are payable over
a ten year period.
 
  In connection with the Reorganization, the Company also received newly
issued Vencor Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock. The Company
sold the preferred stock to certain of its employees, which
 
                                      52
<PAGE>
 
includes both current Vencor employees and employees of the Company, for $17.7
million and used the proceeds to refinance long-term debt.
 
  In order to qualify as a REIT, the Company must make annual distributions to
its stockholders of at least 95% of its "REIT taxable income" (excluding net
capital gain). Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to
make distributions in excess of FFO in order to meet such distribution
requirements. In such event, the Company presently would expect to borrow
funds, or to sell assets for cash, to the extent necessary to obtain cash
sufficient to make the distributions required to retain its qualification as a
REIT for federal income tax purposes although there can be no assurance that
the Company would be successful in such efforts. Although the Company is
currently expected to qualify as a REIT for the year ending December 31, 1999,
it is possible that economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may
cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT. See "Market for Registrant's
Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters."
 
  Capital expenditures to maintain and improve the leased properties generally
will be incurred by the tenants. Accordingly, the Company does not believe
that it will incur any major expenditures in connection with the leased
properties. After the terms of the leases expire, or in the event that the
tenants are unable to meet their obligations under the leases, the Company
anticipates that any expenditures for which it may become responsible to
maintain the leased properties will be funded by cash flows from operations
and, in the case of major expenditures, through additional borrowings, asset
sales or issuances of equity. To the extent that unanticipated expenditures or
significant borrowings are required, the Company's liquidity may be affected
adversely.
 
  The Company has invested $14.5 million for the eight months ended December
31, 1998 to acquire healthcare-related properties. The properties purchased
include two skilled nursing centers and eight personal care facilities. One of
the properties acquired was a skilled nursing facility purchased from Vencor
under the Development Agreement for $6.2 million in the third quarter of 1998.
The Company does not currently intend to acquire any additional properties in
1999.
 
  Available sources of capital to finance any future growth will include cash
flows from operations, available borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Facility, the issuance of public or private debt or equity and asset sales, or
a combination of the foregoing. Availability and terms of any such issuance
will depend upon the market for such securities and other conditions at such
time. There can be no assurance that such additional financing or capital will
be available on terms acceptable to the Company. The Company may, under
certain circumstances, borrow additional amounts in connection with the
acquisition of additional properties, and as necessary to meet certain
distribution requirements imposed on REITs under the Code. To the extent the
Company uses equity as consideration for future acquisitions, the Company will
not require additional liquidity to finance such acquisitions. The Company
does not currently intend to acquire any additional properties in 1999.
 
 Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure--The Company
 
  The year 2000 ("Y2K") issue is a result of computer programs and embedded
computer chips using two digits rather than four digits to define the
applicable year. Without corrective action, computer programs and embedded
chips potentially could recognize the date ending in "00" as the year 1900 (or
some other year)
rather than 2000, causing many computer applications to fail or to create
erroneous results. The Company's information technology systems ("IT") and
non-IT systems such as building infrastructure components (e.g., elevators,
alarm systems, electrical systems and other systems) are affected by the Y2K
issue.
 
  During 1998, the Company outsourced all of its information systems support
to Vencor under its Transition Services Agreement which terminated on December
31, 1998. After December 31, 1998, Vencor continued to provide the Company
with certain administrative and support services (primarily computer systems,
telephone networks, mail delivery and other office services). Effective March
15, 1999, the Company moved to new office space and those services are no
longer provided by Vencor.
 
  In January 1999, the Company purchased a new file server and is converting
to a new financial information system platform that is Y2K compliant. The
Company expects that the conversion should be completed during
 
                                      53
<PAGE>

 
the first quarter of 1999. The Company also may be required to replace its
computer hardware with new equipment that is Y2K compliant. The Company has
received certification from all of its significant software and operating
systems vendors that the versions of their products currently being installed
are Y2K compliant. The Company has not and does not anticipate independently
verifying such compliance. The Company estimates that the total cost it will
incur to install a new server, financial system platform and update its
computer hardware is less than $100,000.
 
  The Company also has Y2K exposure in non-IT applications with respect to its
real estate properties. Computer technology employed in elevators, alarm
systems, electrical systems, built-in healthcare systems and similar
applications involved in the operations of the Company's properties may cause
interruptions of service with respect to those properties. Under the terms of
the Master Leases, Vencor is responsible for upgrading all building
infrastructure components to be Y2K compliant. As of December 31, 1998, Vencor
advised the Company that it has tested and verified as Y2K compliant
approximately 70% of the facility components. Vencor has indicated to the
Company that it does not expect any material Y2K issues with respect to the
Company's facility components. Consequently, the Company does not expect that
its costs for Y2K remediation of its building infrastructure components will
be material. However, there can be no assurance that Vencor's estimate with
respect to estimated costs of remediation is accurate. In addition, there can
be no assurance that Vencor will continue to honor its obligations under the
Master Leases to upgrade all building components to be Y2K compliant or that
Vencor will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable
it to satisfy such obligations.
 
  The most reasonably likely worse case scenario for the Company associated
with the Y2K issue is the risk of significant disruptions of Vencor's business
resulting from either (i) Vencor's failure to upgrade all building
infrastructure components to be Y2K compliant or (ii) the failure of Vencor's
significant third party payors, business partners, suppliers and vendors to be
fully Y2K compliant. Failures of critical utility systems could also lead to
significant business disruptions for Vencor. These occurrences could
negatively impact Vencor's ability to operate the Company's properties and/or
make rental payments under the Master Leases thereby negatively impacting the
Company's liquidity and results of operations. The Y2K issues facing Vencor
and Vencor's Y2K compliance program are discussed below under "--Year 2000
Readiness Disclosure--Vencor."
 
  To date, the Company has not established any contingency plan for the Y2K
issue. Because the Company's most significant risks associated with the Y2K
issue relate to significant disruptions of Vencor's business, the Company
anticipates developing contingency plans during 1999, as is appropriate, based
upon its continuing assessment of Vencor's progress in implementing its Y2K
compliance program and developing its own contingency plans.
 
  The Company's analysis of the Y2K issues affecting the Company is based on
information currently available and information provided from third party
vendors and suppliers. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to Y2K
compliance, there can be no assurance that the Company has accurately or
timely assessed all Y2K issues or that the estimated costs to remediate the
Y2K issues will not be exceeded. While the Company believes it has
substantially completed its assessment of all Y2K issues, its estimate of the
costs to address such issues may change as it proceeds with the remediation
and implementation of its new financial systems. The Company's ability to
identify and remediate critical Y2K issues and the availability and cost of
external resources will impact the Company's total Y2K costs and the impact of
Y2K on the Company's results of operations.
 
 Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure--Vencor
 
  As a result of the Company's dependence upon Vencor as its primary tenant,
the Company may also be impacted negatively by Y2K issues facing Vencor. If
Vencor is unable to meet its Y2K compliance schedules or incurs costs
substantially higher than its current expectations, Vencor's ability to
operate the properties and/or make rental payments under the Master Leases
could be impaired thereby impacting negatively the Company's liquidity and
results of operations. The following discussion briefly describes the Y2K
program instituted by Vencor. The information contained in this section was
provided to the Company by Vencor. The Company is
 
                                      54
<PAGE>
 
not the source of this information, has not verified independently the
activities of Vencor, and there can be no assurance that Vencor has provided
the Company with complete and accurate information in all instances. The
Company is in contact with Vencor to monitor its progress.
 
  In response to the Y2K issue, Vencor established five teams to address Y2K
issues in the following specific areas: (i) IT software and hardware; (ii)
third party relationships; (iii) facility components; (iv) medical equipment;
and (v) telephone systems. Each team is responsible for all phases of Vencor's
Y2K compliance program for both IT and non-IT systems in its designated area.
 
  Vencor's Y2K compliance program consists of five phases: (i) business
assessment; (ii) inventory and assessment; (iii) remediation and testing; (iv)
implementation and rollout; and (v) post-implementation. The business
assessment phase identified potential Y2K issues confronting Vencor. The
inventory and assessment phase consisted of a company-wide assessment of all
facility systems and components, medical devices, and IT software and
hardware. During the remediation and testing phase, Vencor is repairing,
upgrading or replacing any non-compliant IT and non-IT systems. Additionally,
Vencor is performing verification and validation testing of IT and non-IT
systems that have been remediated and those Vencor believes are Y2K compliant.
For IT and non-IT systems that are internally developed, Vencor verifies
compliance status directly with the development staff and performs validation
testing to confirm its status. For IT and non-IT systems that are purchased
from outside vendors, Vencor is requesting written assurances of compliance
directly from the vendors. When non-compliant systems are identified, Vencor
will either replace, upgrade or remediate the system. The implementation and
rollout phase involves the installation of the new financial information and
patient accounting systems and any IT or non-IT systems that have been
remediated and tested to Vencor's corporate office and its facilities. The
final phase, post-implementation, involves finalizing the documentation of the
Y2K program and any corrective efforts surrounding date issues associated with
the year 2000 being a leap year. Vencor has indicated that it has employed and
will continue to employ external consultants to assist it through each of the
phases.
 
 
                                      55
<PAGE>
 
  Vencor derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the Medicare and
Medicaid programs. Vencor relies on these entities for accurate and timely
reimbursement of claims, often through the use of electronic data interfaces.
Vencor has indicated that it believes that while many commercial insurance
carriers will be Y2K compliant, federal and state agencies are more likely to
have system failures caused by Y2K issues. Vencor is contacting all of its
significant reimbursement sources to determine their Y2K compliance status in
order to make a determination of this potential risk. Vencor has not received
assurance that systems used by Medicare and Medicaid will be Y2K compliant.
The failure of information systems of federal and state governmental agencies
and other third party payors could have a material adverse effect on Vencor's
liquidity and financial condition, which in turn could have a material adverse
effect on the Company's liquidity and financial condition.
 
  Vencor also has initiated communications with its critical suppliers and
vendors. Vencor is evaluating information provided by third party vendors and
is conducting limited independent testing of critical systems and
applications. In most cases, Vencor is relying on information being provided
to it by such third parties. While Vencor is attempting to evaluate the
information provided, there can be no assurance that in all instances accurate
information is being provided. If third party suppliers and vendors fail to
respond to Vencor's request for information, Vencor may seek to procure other
sources of supplies.
 
 
                                      56
<PAGE>
 
  Although Vencor is assessing the readiness of the Medicare and Medicaid
programs and other third party payers and preparing contingency plans, there
can be no guarantee that the failure of these third parties to remediate their
systems to be Y2K compliant will not have a material adverse effect on Vencor,
which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
 
  The following discussion of the Company's exposure to various market risks
contains "forward looking statements" that involve risks and uncertainties.
These projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions
considered reasonable in light of information currently available to the
Company. Nevertheless, because of the inherent unpredictability of interest
rates as well as other factors, actual results could differ materially from
those projected in such forward looking information.
 
  The Company earns revenue by leasing its assets under long-term triple net
leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators,
subject to certain limitations. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. The Company's debt obligations are floating rate obligations whose
interest rate and related cash flows vary with the movement in LIBOR. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources". The general fixed nature of the
Company's assets and the variable nature of the Company's debt obligations
creates interest rate risk. If interest rates were to rise significantly, the
Company's lease revenue might not be sufficient to meet its debt obligations.
In order to mitigate this risk, at or about the date the Company spun off its
healthcare operations under the Reorganization, it also entered into interest
rate swaps to convert most of its floating rate debt obligations to fixed rate
debt obligations. Interest rate swaps generally involve the exchange of fixed
and floating rate interest payments on an underlying notional amount. As of
December 31, 1998, the Company had $900 million of interest rate swaps
outstanding with a highly rated counterparty in which the Company pays a fixed
rate of 5.985% and receives LIBOR from the counterparty. When interest rates
rise the interest rate swap agreement increases in market value to the Company
and when interest rates fall the interest rate swap agreement declines in
value to the Company. Since the interest rate swap agreement was executed,
interest rates have generally been lower and the market value of the interest
rate swap agreement has been an unrealized loss to the Company. As of December
31, 1998, the interest rate swap agreement was in an unrealized loss position
to the Company of approximately $39.2 million. To highlight the sensitivity of
the interest rate swap agreement to changes in interest rates the following
summary shows the effects of an instantaneous change of 100 basis points (BPS)
in interest rates as of December 31, 1998:

  The terms of this interest rate swap agreement require that the Company make
a cash payment or otherwise post collateral, such as a letter of credit from
one of the banks identified in the Bank Credit Agreement to the counterparty
if the market value loss to the Company exceed certain levels (the "threshold
levels"). See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources." The threshold levels
vary based on the relationship between the Company's debt obligations and the
tangible fair market value of its assets as defined in the Bank Credit
Agreement. As of December 31, 1998, the threshold level under the interest
rate swap agreement was a market value loss of $35 million and the interest
rate swap agreement was in an unrealized loss position to the Company of $39.2
million. Under the interest rate swap agreement, if collateral must be posted,
the principal amount of such collateral must equal the difference between the
market value of the interest rate swap at the time of such determination and
the threshold amount. As of December 31, 1998, the Company had a letter of
credit outstanding as posted collateral under the interest rate swap agreement
in the amount of $10.9 million, which reduced the availability of the
Company's revolving line of credit under its Bank Credit Agreement as of that
date by a similar amount. As of March 19, 1999, the market value unrealized
loss of the interest rate swap agreement had declined below the $35 million
threshold to $15 million and the letter of credit outstanding had been reduced
to one dollar ($1). Under the Bank Credit Agreement, the maximum amount that
may be outstanding under such letters of credit at any time is $25 million.

              ITEM X. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA
 
                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
 
Board of Directors
Ventas, Inc.
 
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Ventas, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for the
period May 1, 1998 through December 31, 1998. Our audit also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 14. These
consolidated financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and schedule based on our audit.
 
  We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
 
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Ventas, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1998, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for the period May 1, 1998
through December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.
 
  As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements,
approximately 98.7% of the Company's 1998 rental income was received from
Vencor, Inc. As a result thereof, the Company is financially dependent upon
Vencor's ability to pay the rental income which is contractually due the
Company. Vencor has also announced that it will incur a significant loss for
1998. This could have a material adverse effect on Vencor's financial
condition and adversely affect its ability to make contractual and timely
rental payments to the Company. Vencor has also received approval to extend
its credit facility and a waiver of covenant violations through March 31,
1999, and there is no assurance that Vencor's lenders will further extend the
credit facility or provide additional waivers. As discussed in Notes 4 and 12,
the Company has a bridge loan in the amount of $275 million which is due on
October 30,1999, which will either have to be extended, refinanced or repaid.
These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue
as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
                               December 31, 1998
 
1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies
 
Organization
 
  Ventas, Inc. (the Company), formerly named Vencor, Inc., is a real estate
company that owns or leases 45 hospitals, 219 nursing centers and eight
personal care facilities in 36 states as of December 31, 1998. The Company
conducts all of its business through a wholly-owned operating partnership,
Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership. The Company anticipates that it will meet
the requirements to qualify as a real estate investment trust (REIT) for
Federal income tax purposes for the tax year beginning January 1, 1999. The
Company expects to use an operating partnership (UPREIT) upon election of REIT
status. The Company operates in one segment which consists of owning and
leasing healthcare facilities to third parties.
 
  On April 30, 1998, the Company changed its name to Ventas, Inc. and on May
1, 1998, refinanced substantially all of its long-term debt in connection with
the spin off of its healthcare operations through the distribution of the
common stock of a new entity (which assumed its former name), Vencor, Inc.
(Vencor) to stockholders of the Company of record as of April 27, 1998 (the
Reorganization Transactions). The distribution was effected on May 1, 1998
(the Distribution Date). For financial reporting periods subsequent to the
Distribution Date, the historical financial statements of the Company were
assumed by Vencor and the Company is deemed to have commenced operations on
May 1, 1998. Accordingly, the Company does not have comparable financial
results for prior periods. The beginning balances in shareholders' equity at
May 1, 1998 reflect the net historical balances of the Company's real estate
investments, long-term borrowings and other real estate related assets and
liabilities after giving effect to the Reorganization Transactions.
 
New Accounting Pronouncements
 
  In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which is required to be adopted in years
beginning after June 15, 1999. SFAS 133 permits early adoption as of the
beginning of any fiscal quarter after its issuance. The Company expects to
adopt SFAS 133 effective January 1, 2000. SFAS 133 will require the Company to
recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that
are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the
derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the
fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair
value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings
or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is
recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in
fair value will be recognized immediately in earnings. Based on the Company's
derivative positions and their related fair values at December 31, 1998, the
Company estimates that if adopted on December 31, 1998 it would report a
reduction of $39.2 million in other comprehensive income. The Company was not
required to report this $39.2 million unrealized loss in 1998.
 
Consolidation
 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company,
Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership (the Partnership) and other subsidiaries
after elimination of all material intercompany accounts and transactions.
 
Real Estate Investments
 
  Investments in real estate properties are recorded at cost. The cost of the
properties acquired is allocated between land and buildings based generally
upon independent appraisals. Depreciation for buildings is recorded on the
straight-line basis, using estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 50 years.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)
 
 
Impairment of Assets
 
  Provisions for impairment losses related to long-lived assets, if any, are
recognized when expected future cash flows are less than the carrying values
of the assets. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates
the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relationship to
the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. The Company
adjusts the net book value of leased properties and other long-lived assets to
fair value, if the sum of the expected future cash flow or sales proceeds is
less than book value. No impairment losses have been recorded for the period
ended December 31, 1998.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
  Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity date
of three months or less when purchased. These investments are stated at cost
which approximates fair value.
 
Deferred Financing Costs
 
  Deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
terms of the related borrowings and are net of accumulated amortization of
approximately $3.22 million at December 31, 1998.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
  Rental income is recognized as earned over the terms of the related Master
Leases and are treated as operating leases. Such income includes periodic
increases based on pre-determined formulas as defined in the Master Lease
agreements (see Master Lease Agreements in Transactions with Vencor--Note 8).
 
Earnings Per Share
 
  Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period ended December 31, 1998. Average
shares outstanding for basic earnings per share were 67,819,205 for 1998. The
calculation of diluted earnings per share amounts reflect the additional
dilutive effect of stock options of 45,657 shares for 1998.
 
Stock Based Compensation
 
  The Company grants stock options to employees and directors with an exercise
price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of the grant. In
accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, compensation expense is not recognized for these stock
option grants.
 
  In addition, the Company grants shares of restricted stock to certain
executive officers and directors. Shares of restricted stock vest cumulatively
in four equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the
date of the grant. In accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, compensation expense is recognized
for these restricted stock grants over the vesting period.
 
Accounting Estimates
 
  The preparation of financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2. Real Estate Investments
 
  Substantially all of the Company's real estate investments are leased under
provisions of four Master Leases with Vencor with initial terms ranging from
10 to 15 years, plus renewal options. Each Master Lease provides for minimum
annual rentals which are subject to annual increases on May 1 of each calendar
year of two percent (2%) as long as net patient service revenues of the
facilities covered under the applicable Master Lease for the prior calendar
year exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of patient service revenues in the base
year of 1997. Under the terms of the Master Leases, the lessee is responsible
for all maintenance, repairs, taxes and insurance on the leased properties.
 
  The future contracted minimum rentals, excluding rent escalations, for the
remainder of the initial terms of the master leases and other leases are as
follows (in thousands):

3. Concentration of Credit Risk and Going Concern
 
  As of December 31, 1998, 70% of the Company's real estate investments
related to skilled nursing facilities. The remaining real estate investments
consist of hospitals and personal care facilities. The Company's facilities
are located in 36 states and lease revenues from operations in any one state
do not account for more than ten percent (10%). Approximately ninety-seven and
two-tenths percent (97.2%) of the Company's real estate investments, based on
the original cost of such investments, are operated by Vencor and
approximately ninety-eight and seven-tenths percent (98.7%) of rental income
is from Vencor leases. Of the remaining six operators, none operate
investments in facilities representing more than five percent (5%) of the
total real estate investments.
 
  The Company is very dependent on the financial stability of Vencor and
Vencor's financial ability to meet its obligations under the Master Lease
Agreements and the other agreements identified in Note 8. Vencor has announced
that it expects fourth quarter results to be significantly lower than the
third quarter of 1998. Vencor has also disclosed that it expects to record
additional adjustments in the fourth quarter which could have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition. Vencor has also announced that it
may be necessary to renegotiate its bank credit facility since its operating
results and fourth quarter adjustments may result in covenant violations with
its lenders. Vencor has received approval to extend its credit facility and a
waiver of its covenant violations through March 31, 1999. Vencor is also
subject to significant government regulations in connection with operating
long-term acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Further, as a result of the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Vencor is now subject to the prospective payment
system which could adversely affect Vencor's revenues as a result of reduced
reimbursements from its Medicare and Medicaid patients and reduced revenue
from ancillary services.
 
  If Vencor defaults on any of its lease payments to the Company, it will
adversely affect the Company's ability to meet its current obligations,
including the required payments on its bank credit facility, and in making the
required distributions to the stockholders required for the Company to qualify
as a REIT. Also, if Vencor is unable to meet its indemnification
responsibilities under the reorganization agreement, the agreement for

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)
 
indemnity for third party contracts and the agreement of indemnity under third
party leases, these obligations could revert back to the Company. These
obligations include, among other things, lawsuits, investigations and other
matters such as patient issues, third party contracts and the third party
leases, which arose prior to the Reorganization Transactions. The consolidated
financial statements do not contain any adjustments in the event that Vencor
defaults on any of its agreements with the Company and, therefore, would be
unable to fulfill its indemnity and other legal responsibilities to the
Company.
 
  Continuation of the Company's operations in its present form is dependent
upon Vencor's ability to fulfill its indemnity and other legal
responsibilities to the Company in accordance with the agreements between the
two entities as described in Note 8. Also, the Company is dependent upon
Vencor's ability to make its lease payments on a timely basis and in
accordance with their contractual terms. As further described in Notes 4 and
12, the Company has a bridge loan in the amount of $275 million which is due
on October 30, 1999, which will have to be extended, refinanced or repaid. The
consolidated financial statements do not contain any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of these uncertainties. If and when Vencor has
stabilized its financial condition and the Company has resolved its short-term
debt maturities, the Company intends to reimplement its business strategy in
pursuing acquisitions or development of additional healthcare or other
properties.
 
  Management has taken certain initiatives to address these issues. The
Company has retained Merrill Lynch & Co., as financial advisor, to assist in
its review of Vencor's financial condition and its ability to comply with the
covenants in its bank credit facility. Merrill Lynch is also assisting the
Company in its review of alternatives to repay the $275 million portion of its
credit facility that matures on October 30, 1999, and to assess other
strategic alternatives for the Company.
 
  The Company has subsequently increased its cash position so that it has cash
and overnight investments in banks totaling $65.8 million.
 
  The Company and Vencor have discussed Vencor's recent results of operations
and Vencor's need to amend or restructure its existing indebtedness. In those
discussions, Vencor has requested interim rent concessions under the Master
Leases and the Company has rejected that request. The Company will consider
appropriate actions to take in response to any further proposals by Vencor as
may be in the best interests of the Company.

  On April 30, 1998, the Company, through Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership,
consummated a $1.2 billion bank credit agreement (the Bank Credit Agreement).
The Bank Credit Agreement comprises (i) a three year $250 million revolving
letter of credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) priced at the London
Interbank Offered

Rate (LIBOR) plus 2 to 2 1/2%, (ii) a $200 million Term A Loan (the Term A
Loan) payable in various installments over three years priced at LIBOR plus 2
1/4 to 2 1/2%, (iii) a $350 million Term B Loan (the Term B Loan) payable in
various installments over five years priced at LIBOR plus 2 3/4 to 3%, and
(iv) a $400 million loan due October 30, 1999 and priced at LIBOR plus 2 3/4
to 3%. The Bank Credit Agreement is secured by a pledge of the Company's
general partnership interest in the operating partnership, Ventas Realty,
Limited Partnership and contains various covenants.
 
  In connection with the Reorganization Transactions and the consummation of
the Bank Credit Agreement, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
agreement ($900 million outstanding at December 31, 1998) to eliminate the
impact of changes in interest rates on approximately $1 billion of floating
rate debt. The agreement expires in varying amounts through December 2006 as
set out in the table below and provides for the Company to pay a fixed rate at
5.985% and receive LIBOR (floating rate). The fair value of the swap agreement
is not recognized in the consolidated financial statements (see New Accounting
Pronouncements in Note 1). The terms of the swap agreement require that the
Company make a cash payment or otherwise post collateral, such as a letter of
credit from one of the banks identified in the Bank Credit Agreement (which
limits the amount of any such letters of credit to $25 million) to the
counterparty if the market value loss to the Company exceed certain levels.
The threshold levels vary based on the relationship between the Company's debt
obligations and the tangible fair market value of its assets as defined in the
Bank Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 1998, the Company had a letter of
credit outstanding as posted collateral under the interest rate swap agreement
in the amount of $10.9 million, which reduced the availability of the
Revolving Credit Facility as of that date by a similar amount.

   Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year.....  931,127  970,327
</TABLE>
 
  The estimate of fair value of the Company's long-term debt includes the
effect of the interest rate swap agreement (See New Accounting Pronouncements
in Note 1) and is based upon estimates of fair value based on the present
value of discounted cash flows for the same or similar issues of long-term
debt and the related interest rate swap agreement.
 
  Fair value estimates are subjective in nature and are dependent on a number
of important assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows, risks,
discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each
financial instrument. The use of different market assumptions and estimation
methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value
amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented above are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market
exchange.
 
6. Shareholders' Equity and Stock Options
 
  The Company has plans under which options to purchase common stock may be
granted to officers, employees and certain non-employee directors. Options are
exercisable at the market price at the date of grant,

expire ten years from the date of grant, and vest over four years. The Company
also grants restricted stock to officers, employees and certain non-employee
directors that vest over four years. As of December 31, 1998, options for
5,603,136 shares had been granted to eligible participants and remained
outstanding (including options granted and held by Vencor employees--see
Organization in Note 1) under the provisions of these plans. The Company
granted 150,000 shares of restricted stock for the period May 1, 1998 through
December 31, 1998. The market value of the restricted shares on the date of
the award has been recorded as unearned compensation on restricted stock, with
the unamortized balance shown as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
Unearned compensation is amortized to expense over the vesting period, with
charges to operations of approximately $349,000 in 1998.
 
  At December 31, 1998, options currently exercisable (2,262,232) have a
weighted average exercise price of $15.74. Shares available for future grants
as of December 31, 1998 are 1,658,450.

  Under the terms of the Ventas, Inc. 1997 Incentive Compensation Plan (the
Employee Plan), the Company has reserved 3,400,000 shares for grants to be
issued to employees. Under the terms of the Ventas, Inc. 1997 Stock Option
Plan for Non-Employee Directors, the Company has reserved 200,000 shares for
grants to be issued to non-employee directors.
 
  In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
(Statement 123). This standard prescribes a fair value based method of
accounting for employee stock options or similar equity instruments and
requires certain pro forma disclosures. For purposes of the pro forma
disclosures required under Statement 123, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the option's vesting period. The
estimated weighted average fair value of options granted in 1998 was
approximately $817,000.
 
  Pro forma information follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
<TABLE>

  In determining the estimated fair value of the Company's stock options as of
the date of grant, a Black-Scholes option pricing model was used with the
following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 6%; a
dividend yield of 9%; volatility factors of the expected market price of the
Company's common stock at .25%; and a weighted-average expected life of the
options of 8 years.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)
 
  The Black-Scholes options valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in
the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock
options.
 
7. Income Taxes
 
  As part of the Reorganization Transactions, the Company entered into a Tax
Allocation Agreement with Vencor which provides that the Company will be
liable for taxes of the Company's consolidated group attributable to periods
prior to the Distribution Date with respect to the portion of such taxes
attributable to the property held by the Company after the Distribution Date
and Vencor will be liable for such pre-distribution taxes with respect to the
portion of such taxes attributable to the property held by Vencor after the
Distribution Date. The Tax Allocation Agreement further provides that the
Company will be liable for any taxes attributable to the Reorganization
Transactions except that Vencor will be liable for any such taxes to the
extent that Vencor derives certain future tax benefits as a result of the
payment of such taxes. The Company and its subsidiaries are liable for taxes
payable with respect to periods after the Reorganization Transactions that are
attributable to the Company's operations and Vencor and its subsidiaries are
liable for taxes payable with respect to periods after the Reorganization
Transactions that are attributable to Vencor's operations. If, in connection
with a tax audit or filing of an amended return, a taxing authority adjusts
the Company's or Vencor's tax liability with respect to taxes for which the
other party was liable under the Tax Allocation Agreement, such other party
would be liable for the resulting tax assessment or would be entitled to the
resulting tax refund.

8. Transactions with Vencor
 
  In order to govern certain of the relationships between the Company and
Vencor after the Reorganization Transactions and to provide mechanisms for an
orderly transition, the Company and Vencor entered into various agreements at
the time of the Reorganization Transactions. The Company believes that the
agreements contain terms which generally are comparable to those which would
have been reached in arms' length negotiations with unaffiliated parties. The
terms of the Master Lease Agreements and other related agreements are
described below:
 
Master Lease Agreements
 
  In the Reorganization Transactions, the Company retained substantially all
of its real property, buildings and other improvements (primarily long-term
care hospitals and nursing centers) and leased these facilities to Vencor
under four Master Lease Agreements. Such Master Lease Agreements contain terms
which govern the rights, duties and responsibilities of the Company and Vencor
relative to each of the leased properties. The leased properties include land,
buildings, structures, easements, improvements on the land and permanently
affixed equipment, machinery and other fixtures relating to the operations of
the facilities.
 
  The Master Leases are structured as triple-net leases pursuant to which
Vencor is required to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance
related to the properties. The base annual rents is approximately $221.5
million plus a two percent (2%) per annum escalator, which escalator is
contingent upon Vencor achieving net patient service revenue for the
applicable year in excess of seventy-five percent (75%) of patient service
revenues in the base year of 1997. The initial terms of these leases were for
periods ranging from 10 to 15 years.
 
  Except as noted below, upon the occurrence of an event of default under a
Master Lease, the Master Lease provides that the Company may, at its option,
exercise the remedies under the Master Lease on all properties included within
that Master Lease. The remedies which may be exercised under the Master Lease
by the Company, at its option, include the following: (i) after not less than
ten (10) days notice to Vencor, terminate the Master Lease, repossess the
leased property and relet the leased property to a third party and require
that Vencor pay to the Company, as liquidated damages, the net present value
of the rent for the balance of the term, discounted at the prime rate; (ii)
without terminating the Master Lease, repossess the leased property and relet
the leased property with Vencor remaining liable under the Master Lease for
all obligations to be performed by Vencor thereunder, including the
difference, if any, between the rent under the Master Lease and the rent
payable as a result of the reletting of the leased property; (iii) demand that
Vencor purchase either the property which is the subject of the default or all
of the properties included within that Master Lease, at the Company's option,
for the higher of the fair market value or the minimum repurchase price, both
as defined in the Master Lease; and (iv) any and all other rights and remedies
available at law or in equity.
 
  Each Master Lease provides that the remedies under such Master Lease may be
exercised with respect only to the properties that is the subject of the
default upon the occurrence of any one of the following events of
 
                                     F-12

default: (i) the occurrence of a final non-appealable revocation of Vencor's
license to operate a facility; (ii) the revocation of certification of a
facility for reimbursement under Medicare; or (iii) Vencor becomes subject to
regulatory sanctions at a facility and fails to cure the regulatory sanctions
within the applicable cure period. Upon the occurrence of the fifth such event
of default under a Master Lease with respect to any one or more properties,
the Master Lease permits the Company, at its option, to exercise the rights
and remedies under the Master Lease on all properties included within that
Master Lease.
 
  The occurrence of any one of the following events of default constitute an
event of default under all Master Leases permitting the Company, at its
option, to exercise the rights and remedies under all the Master Leases
simultaneously: (i) the occurrence of an event of default under the Agreement
of Indemnity--Third Party Leases between the Company and Vencor, (ii) the
liquidation or dissolution of Vencor, (iii) if Vencor files a petition of
bankruptcy or a petition for reorganization or arrangement under the Federal
bankruptcy laws, and (iv) a petition is filed against Vencor under Federal
bankruptcy laws and same is not dismissed within ninety (90) days of its
institution.
 
  Any notice of the occurrence of an event of default under the Master Lease
which the Company sends to Vencor must be sent simultaneously to Vencor's
leasehold mortgagee (the Leasehold Mortgagee). Prior to terminating a Master
Lease for all or any part of the leased property covered thereunder, the
Company must give the Leasehold Mortgagee thirty (30) days prior written
notice and an opportunity to cure the default.
 
  Vencor may, with the prior written approval of the Company, sell, assign or
sublet its interest in all or any portion of the leased property under a
Master Lease. The Company may not unreasonably withhold its approval to any
such transfer provided (i) the assignee is creditworthy, (ii) the assignee has
at least four years of operational experience, (iii) the assignee has a
favorable business and operational reputation, (iv) the assignee assumes the
Master Lease in writing, (v) the sublease is subject and subordinate to the
terms of the Master Lease and (vi) Vencor and any guarantor remains primarily
liable under the Master Lease.
 
  Each Master Lease requires Vencor to maintain liability, all risk property
and workers' compensation insurance for the properties at a level reasonable
with respect to the properties. Each Master Lease further provides that in the
event a property is totally destroyed, or is substantially destroyed such that
the damage renders the property unsuitable for its intended use, Vencor will
have the option to either restore the property at its cost to its pre-
destruction condition or offer to purchase the leased property (in either
event all insurance proceeds, net of administrative and related costs, will be
made available to Vencor). If the Company rejects the offer to purchase,
Vencor will have the option to either restore the property or terminate the
applicable Master Lease with respect to the property. If the damage is such
that the property is not rendered unsuitable for its intended use, or if it is
not covered by insurance, each Master Lease requires Vencor to restore the
property to its original condition.
 
Development Agreement
 
  Under the terms of the Development Agreement, Vencor, if it so desires, will
complete the construction of certain development properties substantially in
accordance with the existing plans and specifications for each such property.
Upon completion of each such development property, the Company has the option
to purchase the development property from Vencor at a purchase price equal to
the amount of Vencor's actual costs in acquiring and developing and such
development property prior to the purchase date. If the Company purchases the
development property, Vencor will lease the development property from the
Company. The initial annual base rent under such a lease will be ten percent
(10%) of the actual costs incurred by Vencor in acquiring and developing the
development property. The other terms of the lease for the development
property will be substantially similar to those set forth in the Master
Leases. As of December 31, 1998, the Company had acquired one skilled nursing
center under the Development Agreement for $6.2 million and has entered into
separate lease with Vencor with respect to such facility. The Development
Agreement has a five year term, and the Company and Vencor each have the right
to terminate the Development Agreement in the event of a change of control.

Participation Agreement
 
  Under the terms and conditions of the Participation Agreement, Vencor has a
right of first offer to become the lessee of any real property acquired or
developed by the Company which is to be operated as a hospital, nursing center
or other healthcare facility, provided that Vencor and the Company can
negotiate a mutually satisfactory lease arrangement and provided that the
property is not leased by the Company to the existing operator of such
facility.
 
  The Participation Agreement also provides, subject to certain terms, that
the Company has a right of first offer to purchase or finance any healthcare
related real property that Vencor determines to sell or mortgage to a third
party, provided that Vencor and the Company can negotiate mutually
satisfactory terms for such purchase or mortgage. The Participation Agreement
has a three year term and the Company and Vencor each have the right to
terminate the Participation Agreement in the event of a change of control.
 
Transition Services Agreement
 
  The Transition Services Agreement, which expired pursuant to its terms on
December 31, 1998, provided that Vencor would provide the Company with
transitional administrative and support services, including but not limited to
finance and accounting, human resources, risk management, legal, and
information systems support. The Company paid Vencor $1.6 million for the
eight months ended December 31, 1998, for services provided under the
Transition Services Agreement.
 
  After December 31, 1998, Vencor continued to provide the Company with
certain administrative and support services (primarily computer systems,
telephone networks, mail delivery and other office services). Subsequent to
year end, the Company moved to new office space and those services are no
longer provided by Vencor. Vencor has also agreed to assist in the preparation
of certain tax returns and other tax filings to be made on behalf of the
Company for the period ending on or before December 31, 1998. There can be no
assurance that Vencor will continue to assist the Company in the preparation
of these tax documents or that the Company will be able to timely and
accurately complete such tax filings if Vencor should discontinue its
assistance, although the Company intends to take all actions necessary to
enable it do so.
 
Agreement of Indemnity--Third Party Leases
 
  In connection with the Reorganization Transactions, the Company assigned its
former third party lease obligations as a tenant or as a guarantor of tenant
obligations to Vencor. The Company remains primarily liable on substantially
all of the third party lease obligations assigned to Vencor. Under the terms
of the Agreement of Indemnity--Third Party Leases, Vencor and its subsidiaries
have agreed to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and against all
claims against the Company arising out of the third party lease obligations
assigned by the Company to Vencor. If Vencor is unable to satisfy the
obligations under any third party lease assigned by the Company to Vencor,
then the Company will be liable for the payment and performance of the
obligations under any such third party lease. The leases have remaining terms
ranging from 1 to 63 years.

Agreement of Indemnity--Third Party Contracts
 
  In connection with the Reorganization Transactions, the Company assigned its
former third party guaranty agreements to Vencor. The Company remains
primarily liable on substantially all of the third party guarantees assigned
to Vencor. Under the terms of the Agreement of Indemnity--Third Party
Contracts, Vencor and its

subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and
against all claims against the Company arising out of the third party
guarantees assigned by the Company to Vencor. If Vencor is unable to satisfy
the obligations under any third party guaranty agreement assigned by the
Company to Vencor, then the Company will be liable for the payment and
performance of the obligations under any such agreement. These third party
guarantees were entered into in connection with certain acquisitions and
financing transactions. The total aggregate exposure under these guarantees is
approximately $45.9 million at December 31, 1998. Atria Communications, Inc.
has also agreed to indemnify and hold the Company harmless form and against
all claims against the Company arising out of the third party contracts, which
has an aggregate principal amount of approximately $35 million.
 
9. Supplemental Disclosure of Cash Flow Information
 
  During the period May 1, 1998 through December 31, 1998, the Company paid
taxes and interest of approximately $616,000 and $52,448,000, respectively.
 
10. Litigation
 
 
  The following litigation and other matters arose from the Company's
operations prior to the Reorganization Transactions. In connection with the
Reorganization Transactions, Vencor agreed to assume the defense, on behalf of
the Company, of any claims that were pending at the time of the Reorganization
Transactions and which arose out of the ownership or operation of the
healthcare operations. Vencor also agreed to defend, on behalf of the Company,
any claims asserted after the Reorganization Transactions which arose out of
the ownership and operation of the healthcare operations. However, there can
be no assurance that Vencor will continue to defend the Company in such
proceedings and actions or that Vencor will have sufficient assets, income and
access to financing to enable it to satisfy such obligations or its
obligations incurred in connection with the Reorganization Transactions.
 
  A class action lawsuit entitled A. Carl Helwig v. Vencor, Inc., et al., was
filed on December 24, 1997 in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Kentucky (Civil Action No. 3-97CV-8354). The class action claims
were brought by an alleged stockholder of the Company against the Company and
certain executive officers and directors of the Company. The complaint alleges
that the Company and certain current and former executive officers of the
Company during a specified time frame violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Exchange Act, by, among other things, issuing to the investing public a series
of false and misleading statements concerning the Company's current operations
and the inherent value of the Company's common stock. The complaint further
alleges that as a result of these purported false and misleading statements
concerning the Company's revenues and successful acquisitions, the price of
the Company's common stock was artificially inflated. In particular, the
complaint alleges that the Company issued false and misleading financial
statements during the first, second and third calendar quarters of 1997 which
misrepresented and understated the impact that changes in Medicare
reimbursement policies would have on the Company's core services and
profitability. The complaint further alleges that the Company issued a series
of materially false statements concerning the purportedly successful
integration of its recent acquisitions and prospective earnings per share for
1997 and 1998 which the Company knew lacked any reasonable basis and were not
being achieved. The suit seeks damages in an amount to be proven at trial,
pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, reasonable attorneys' fees, expert
witness fees and other costs, and any extraordinary equitable and/or
injunctive relief permitted by law or equity to assure that the plaintiff has
an effective remedy. On January 22, 1999, the court granted the Company's
motion to dismiss the case. The plaintiff has appealed the dismissal to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Vencor, on behalf of the
Company, is defending this action vigorously.
 
  A stockholder derivative suit entitled Thomas G. White on behalf of Vencor,
Inc. and Ventas, Inc. v. W. Bruce Lunsford, et al., Case No. 98CI03669, was
filed in June 1998 in the Jefferson County, Kentucky, Circuit Court. The suit
was brought on behalf of Vencor and Ventas against certain current and former
executive officers and directors of Vencor and Ventas. The complaint alleges
that the defendants damaged Vencor and Ventas by
 
                                     F-15

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)
 
engaging in violations of the securities laws, engaging in insider trading,
fraud and securities fraud and damaging the reputation of Vencor and Ventas.
The plaintiff asserts that such actions were taken deliberately, in bad faith
and constitute breaches of the defendants' duties of loyalty and due care. The
complaint is based on substantially similar assertions to those made in the
class action lawsuit entitled A. Carl Helwig v. Vencor, Inc., et al.,
discussed above. The suit seeks unspecified damages, interest, punitive
damages, reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees and other costs, and
any extraordinary equitable and/or injunctive relief permitted by law or
equity to assure that Vencor and Ventas have an effective remedy. Vencor and
the Company each believe that the allegations in the complaint are without
merit and Vencor, on behalf of the Company, intends to defend this action
vigorously.
 
Unasserted claim--Potential Liabilities Due to Fraudulent Transfer
Considerations
 
  Transfers made and obligations incurred in the Reorganization Transactions
and the simultaneous distribution of the Vencor common stock to the Ventas
stockholders (the "Distribution") are subject to review under state fraudulent
conveyance laws, and in the event of a bankruptcy proceeding, federal
fraudulent conveyance laws. Under these laws a court in a lawsuit by an unpaid
creditor or a representative of creditors (such as a trustee or debtor-in-
possession in bankruptcy) could avoid the transfer if it determined that, as
of the time of the Reorganization Transactions, the party making the transfer
or incurring the obligation did not receive fair consideration or reasonably
equivalent value and, at the time of the Reorganization Transactions, the
party making the transfer or incurring the obligation (i) was insolvent or was
rendered insolvent, (ii) had unreasonably small capital with which to carry on
its business and all businesses in which it intended to engage, or
(iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability
to repay such debts as they would mature. In the context of the Distribution,
upon such a determination, any such court could order the holders of the stock
distributed in the Distribution to return the value of the stock and any
dividends paid thereon, bar future dividend and redemption payments on the
stock, and invalidate, in whole or in part, the Distribution as a fraudulent
conveyance. Although Vencor has not asserted a claim, Vencor's legal counsel
has raised questions relating to potential fraudulent conveyance issues
relating to the Reorganization Transactions. At the time of the Reorganization
Transactions, the Company obtained an opinion from an independent third party
that addressed issues of solvency and adequate capitalization. Nevertheless,
if a fraudulent conveyance claim is ultimately asserted by Vencor, creditors,
or others, the ultimate outcome of such a claim cannot presently be
determined. The Company intends to vigorously defend these claims if they are
asserted in a legal proceeding or mediation.
 
11. Related Party Transactions
 
  At December 31, 1998, the Company had receivables of approximately $4
million due from certain executive officers of the Company. The loans include
interest provisions and were to finance the income taxes payable by the
executive officers as a result of the Reorganization Transactions. The loans
are payable over a ten year period.
 
  On October 15, 1998, the Company acquired eight personal care facilities and
related facilities for approximately $7 million from Tangram Rehabilitation
Network, Inc. (Tangram). Tangram is a wholly owned subsidiary of Res-Care,
Inc. (Res-Care) of which a director of the Company is the Chairman, President
and Chief Executive Officer. The Company leases the Tangram facilities to
Tangram pursuant to a Master Lease Agreement which is guaranteed by Res-Care.
Through December 31, 1998, Tangram has paid the Company approximately $155,000
in rent payments.
 
12. Subsequent Events
 
  Subsequent to December 31, 1998, the amount Due from Vencor, Inc. was paid
in full. Subsequent to December 31, 1998, the Company drew $125 million under
the revolving line of credit and used the proceeds to pay down the bridge
facility loan due October 30, 1999 reducing the balance of that loan to $275
million. In addition, the Company drew $50 million under the revolving line of
credit to use for working capital purposes.

$136,855.68                                                 Louisville, Kentucky
                                                              October 22, 1998


     FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned STEVEN T. DOWNEY (hereinafter referred
to as "Maker"), hereby promises and agrees to pay to the order of VENTAS, INC.
(hereinafter referred to as "Payee"), with an address of 3300 Aegon Center,
Louisville, Kentucky, the aggregate principal sum of ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX
THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS AND SIXTY EIGHT CENTS ($136,855.68) in
lawful money of the United States of America, in the manner set forth herein, on
or before February 15, 2003 (the "Maturity Date").

     Principal of this note (the "Note") shall not bear interest; provided that
upon the occurrence of an event of default the outstanding principal balance of
this Note shall bear interest as provided below.

     Principal on this Note shall be paid in four (4) equal annual installment
of THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN DOLLARS AND NINETY TWO CENTS
($34,213.92) each, commencing on the 15th day of February, 2000, and continuing
on the 15th day of February of each successive year thereafter until the
Maturity Date, on which date all of the remaining unpaid principal of this Note
shall be paid. Notwithstanding the above, the unpaid principal balance of this
Note shall be forgiven and this Note shall be extinguished if any of the
following events shall occur on or prior to the Maturity Date: (a) upon a
"Change in Control," as defined in the 1997 Incentive Compensation Plan of the
Payee, (b) if the Payee shall terminate Maker's employment with the Payee for
any reason other than "Cause," as defined below, (c) if the Maker's employment
with the Payee is terminate by reason of death or disability of the Payee, or
(d) if Maker shall terminate his employment with the Payee for "Good Reason," as
defined below. The terms "Cause" and "Good Reason" as used herein shall have the
meaning ascribed to those terms in the Employment Agreement dated September 21,
1998, between the Maker and the Payee. In connection with any such
extinguishment of this Note, the Payee shall pay to the Maker an amount (the
"Gross-Up Payment") equal to all taxes required to be paid by the Maker with
respect to the forgiveness of the principal of this Note under the terms of any
federal, state or local government or taxing authority, including any tax
imposed on the Gross-Up Payment.

     All payments of principal and any other sums due under this Note shall be
made to Payee at the address written above or to such other person or at such
other address as may be designated in writing by the holder of this Note. All
payments on this Note shall be applied first to the payment of any expenses or
charges payable hereunder, and then to the principal balance hereof, or in such
other order as Payee may elect in Payee's sole discretion.

     The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute
a default under this Note: (i) the failure of Maker to pay principal or interest
of this Note as and when due, or within five (5) days thereafter; or (ii) the
insolvency of, the appointment of a custodian or trustee
<PAGE>
 
for, or an assignment for the benefit of creditors by or the filing of a
petition under bankruptcy, insolvency or debtor's relief law by or against,
Maker.

     Whenever there is a default under this Note the entire principal balance of
this Note, shall, at the option of the holder hereof, become forthwith due and
payable, without presentment, notice, protest or demand of any kind (all of
which are expressly waived by Maker).  Upon the occurrence of any such default,
at the option of the Payee, the entire unpaid principal balance of this Note
shall thereafter bear interest at the highest rate permitted by applicable law
and shall continue to bear interest at such rate until the default is cured or
until this Note is paid in full.

     This Note is hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event
whatsoever, whether by reason of acceleration of the maturity hereof, or
otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to Payee for the use,
forbearance or detention of the money loaned hereunder, or advanced for the
performance or payment of any covenant or obligation contained herein or in any
other document evidencing, securing or pertaining to the indebtedness evidenced
hereby, exceed the maximum amount permissible under applicable law.  If from any
circumstances whatsoever fulfillment of any provision hereof or of any such
other document, at the time performance of such provisions shall be due, shall
involve transcending the limit of validity prescribed by law, then ipso facto
                                                                   ----------
the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity,
and if from such circumstance the holder hereof shall ever receive anything of
value deemed by applicable law to be interest in any amount that would exceed
the highest lawful rate payable hereunder, an amount equal to any excessive
interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing
hereunder and not to the payment of interest, and if the amount that would be
excessive interest exceeds the principal balance then owing, such excess shall
be refunded to the party paying same.

     Failure of the holder of this Note to exercise any of such holder's rights
and remedies shall not constitute a waiver of the right to exercise the same at
that or any other time. All rights and remedies of the holder for default under
this Note shall be cumulative to the greatest extent permitted by law. Time
shall be of the essence in the payment of all amounts under this Note and the
performance of Maker's other obligations under this Note.

     If there is any default under this Note, and this Note is placed in the
hands of an attorney for collection, or is collected through any court,
including any bankruptcy court, Maker promises to pay to the holder hereof such
holder's reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs incurred in collecting or
attempting to collect or securing or attempting to secure this Note or enforcing
the holder's rights in any collateral securing this Note, provided the same is
legally allowed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky or any state where
the collateral or any part thereof is situated.

     This Note has been delivered in, and shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky without reference to
its conflict of laws rules.  This Note has substantial contacts with the
Commonwealth of Kentucky.  All actions, suits or other proceedings with respect
to this Note shall be brought only in a court of competent 

                                       2
<PAGE>
 
jurisdiction in Jefferson County, Kentucky. In any such action, suit or
proceeding, such court shall have personal jurisdiction over all of the parties
hereto, and service of process upon them under any applicable statutes, laws and
rules shall be deemed valid and good.

     Maker and any other party who is or may become primarily or secondarily
liable for any of the obligations of Maker hereunder hereby waive presentment,
demand, notice of dishonor, protest, notice of protest and nonpayment, and
further waive all exemptions to which they may now or hereafter be entitled
under the laws of this or any other state or of the United States, and further
agree that the holder of this Note shall have the right without notice, to deal
in any way, at any time, with Maker, or any guarantor of this Note or with any
other party who may become primarily or secondarily liable for any of the
obligations of Maker under this Note without waiving any rights the holder of
this Note may have hereunder or by virtue of the laws of the state of Kentucky
or any other state of the United States.

arising out of or due to the failure to pay, perform or discharge in due
course the Healthcare Company Liabilities by any member of the Healthcare
Company Group who has an obligation with respect thereto.
 
  (c) The amount which an Indemnifying Party is required to pay to any
Indemnitee pursuant to Section 3.03(a) or (b) shall be reduced (including,
without limitation, retroactively) by any Insurance Proceeds and other amounts
(including, without limitation, amounts received from Third Parties in respect
of other indemnification or contribution obligations of Third Parties)
actually recovered by such Indemnitee in reduction of the related
Indemnifiable Loss, it being understood and agreed that each member of the
Vencor Group and the Healthcare Company Group shall use its reasonable best
efforts, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, to collect any such
proceeds or other such amounts to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is
entitled, without regard to whether it is the Indemnified Party hereunder. If
an Indemnitee receives an Indemnity Payment in respect of an Indemnifiable
Loss and subsequently receives Insurance Proceeds or other amounts in respect
of such Indemnifiable Loss, then such Indemnitee shall pay to such
Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the difference between (i) the sum of
the amount of such Indemnity Payment and the amount of such Insurance Proceeds
or other amounts actually received and (ii) the amount of such Indemnifiable
Loss. An insurer or a Third Party (including, without limitation, purchasers
under any assets purchase agreements, real estate agreements or any other
agreements relating to Healthcare Company Liabilities or Vencor Liabilities)
who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the
responsibility with respect thereto, or, solely by virtue of the
indemnification provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights with respect
thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or any other
Third Party shall be entitled to a benefit they would not be entitled to
receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions set forth herein by
virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof.
 
  (d) On the Distribution Date, Healthcare Company shall assume (or shall
cause one of its Subsidiaries to assume) (i) the prosecution of all claims
which relate to the Healthcare Business and are pending on the Distribution
Date; and (ii) the defense against all Third Party Claims which are Healthcare
Company Liabilities and are pending on the Distribution Date. Vencor shall use
reasonable efforts to make available and shall cause
 
                                     A-11
<PAGE>
 
its Subsidiaries to use reasonable efforts to make available to Healthcare
Company and its Subsidiaries, at Healthcare Company's expense, (i) any
personnel or any books, records or other documents within its control or which
it otherwise has the ability to make available that Healthcare Company or such
Subsidiary reasonably believes are necessary or appropriate for such
prosecution or defense as provided in this Article III; and (ii) such other
assistance in support of the prosecution or defense of such litigation as
Healthcare Company or its Subsidiaries may reasonably request, including
without limitation, the right to assert in the name of Vencor or any of its
Subsidiaries such rights, claims, counterclaims or defenses that Vencor or
Vencor's Subsidiary would be or would have been entitled to assert in such
litigation or in the prosecution of or defense against such claim had the
Distribution not occurred; provided, however, that no member of the Vencor
Group shall be required to take any action, refrain from taking any action or
make available any assistance if doing so would have the effect of increasing
Liabilities of the Vencor Group.
 
  3.04 Procedure For Indemnification.
 
  (a) If any Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion of any Third Party
Claim with respect to which an Indemnifying Party is obligated under this
Agreement to provide indemnification, such Indemnitee shall give such
Indemnifying Party notice thereof promptly after becoming aware of such Third
Party Claim; provided, however, that the failure of any Indemnitee to give
notice as provided in this Section 3.04 shall not relieve any Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under this Article III, except to the extent that
such Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice.
Such notice shall describe such Third Party Claim in reasonable detail and, if
practicable, shall indicate the estimated amount of the Indemnifiable Loss
that has been or may be sustained by such Indemnitee. Thereafter, such
Indemnitee shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the
Indemnitee's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including
court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to such Third Party Claim.
 
  (b) An Indemnifying Party, at such Indemnifying Party's own expense and
through counsel chosen by such Indemnifying Party (which counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee), may elect to defend any Third
Party Claim. If an Indemnifying Party elects to defend a Third Party Claim,
then, within fifteen Business Days after receiving notice of such Third Party
Claim or sooner (but in no event less than five Business Days) if the nature
of such Third Party Claim so requires, such Indemnifying Party shall notify
the Indemnitee of its intent to do so. Such Indemnitee shall thereupon use
reasonable efforts to make available to such Indemnifying Party, at such
Indemnifying Party's expense, such assistance in support of the prosecution or
defense of such litigation as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request,
including without limitation, the right to assert in the name of the
Indemnitee such rights, claims, counterclaims or defenses that such Indemnitee
would be or would have been permitted to assert in such litigation or in the
prosecution of a claim or counterclaim against a Third Party or in defense
against such Third Party Claim had the Distribution not occurred. Such
Indemnifying Party shall pay such Indemnitee's reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with such cooperation consistent with the
provisions of Article III. Except as provided herein, after notice from an
Indemnifying Party to an Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such
Indemnitee under this Article III for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof. If an
Indemnifying Party elects not to defend against a Third Party Claim, or fails
to notify an Indemnitee of its election as provided in this Section 3.04
within the period of fifteen (or five, if applicable) Business Days described
above, such Indemnitee may defend, compromise and settle such Third Party
Claim; provided, however, that no such Indemnitee may compromise or settle any
such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
 
  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, settle or compromise any Third
Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the
Indemnitee of a written release from all Liability in respect of such Third
Party Claim.
 
  (d) If an Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or to seek to compromise any
Third Party Claim, the related Indemnitee shall make available to such
Indemnifying Party any personnel or any books, records or other
 
                                     A-12
<PAGE>
 
documents within its control or which it otherwise has the ability to make
available that are necessary or appropriate for such defense.
 
  (e) Any claim on account of an Indemnifiable Loss arising out of or due to
the failure to pay, perform or discharge in due course its respective
Liabilities by any member of the Indemnifying Party's Group who has an
obligation with respect thereto but which does not result from a Third Party
Claim shall be asserted by written notice given by the Indemnitee to the
related Indemnifying Party. Such Indemnifying Party shall have a period of 30
days after the receipt of such notice within which to respond thereto. If such
Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 30-day period, such
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have refused to accept responsibility to
make payment. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 30-day
period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, such Indemnitee shall be
free to pursue such remedies as may be available to such party under Article
VI of this Agreement.
 
  (f) If the amount of any Indemnifiable Loss shall, at any time subsequent to
the payment required by this Agreement, be reduced by recovery, settlement or
otherwise, the amount of such reduction, less any expenses incurred in
connection therewith, shall promptly be repaid by the Indemnitee to the
Indemnifying Party.
 
  (g) In the event of payment by an Indemnifying Party to any Indemnitee in
connection with any Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events
or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnitee may have any right or
claim relating to such Third Party Claim against any claimant or plaintiff
asserting such Third Party Claim. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such
Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such
Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right or claim, including
without limitation, permitting the Indemnifying Party to bring suit against
such Third Party in the name of the Indemnitee.
 
                                  ARTICLE IV
 
                         CERTAIN ADDITIONAL COVENANTS
 
  4.01 Further Assurances.
 
  (a) In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this
Agreement and in the Ancillary Agreements, each of the parties hereto shall
use its reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable laws, regulations and agreements to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to confirm
Healthcare Company's title to all of the Healthcare Company Assets and
assumption of all Healthcare Company Liabilities, to put Healthcare Company in
actual possession and operating control of the Healthcare Company Assets, and
to permit Healthcare Company to exercise all rights and to perform its
obligations with respect to the Healthcare Business. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party hereto shall cooperate with the other party, and execute
and deliver, or use its reasonable efforts to cause to be executed and
delivered, all instruments, including instruments of conveyance, assignment
and transfer, and to make all filings with, and to obtain all consents,
approvals or authorizations of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person
under any permit, license, agreement, indenture or other instrument, and take
all such other actions as such party may reasonably be requested to take by
any other party hereto from time to time, consistent with the terms of this
Agreement, in order to effectuate the provisions and purposes of this
Agreement, the Corporate Restructuring Transactions, the assumption of
Liabilities and the other transactions contemplated hereby. If the Corporate
Restructuring Transactions or assumption of Liabilities, including but not
limited to, assignments of contracts, is not consummated prior to or at the
Distribution Date for any reason, including but not limited to, the absence of
receipt of any Consents, then the party hereto retaining such asset or
Liability shall thereafter hold such asset in trust for the use and benefit of
the party entitled thereto (at the expense of the party entitled thereto), or
shall retain such Liability for the account of the party by whom such
Liability is to be assumed pursuant hereto, as the case may be, and shall take
such other action as may be reasonably requested by the party to whom such
asset is to be transferred, or by whom such Liability is to be assumed, as the
case may be, in order to place such party,
 
                                     A-13
<PAGE>
 
insofar as reasonably possible, in the same position as if such asset or
Liability had been transferred as contemplated hereby. If and when any such
asset or Liability becomes transferable, such transfer shall be effected
forthwith. The parties hereto agree that, as of the Distribution Date, as
between the parties, Healthcare Company shall be deemed to have acquired
complete and sole beneficial ownership of all of the Healthcare Company
Assets, together with all rights, powers and privileges incident thereto, and
shall be deemed to have assumed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
all of the Healthcare Company Liabilities, and all duties, obligations and
responsibilities incident thereto.
 
  (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 4.01(a), Vencor, as the sole
stockholder of Healthcare Company prior to the Distribution, shall ratify any
actions which are reasonably necessary or desirable to be taken by Healthcare
Company to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement
or such Ancillary Agreements.
 
  (c) In the event any registration, licenses, permits or other rights granted
by Governmental Authorities to the Vencor Group must be transferred, amended
or issued in order to conduct operations of the Healthcare Company Business
after the Distribution Date, and such permit transfer, amendment or issuance
has not been accomplished as of such date, Vencor shall permit Healthcare
Company to use the registration, license or permit of the Vencor Group to
continue to operate the Healthcare Company Business until such transfer,
amendment or issuance is accomplished, at Healthcare Company's expense, if
permitted by Law, until such permit is transferred or issued to Healthcare
Company. Healthcare Company shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain such
registrations, licenses, permits or other rights granted by Governmental
Authorities as soon as reasonably practicable. Healthcare Company shall
indemnify and hold harmless Vencor from and against any and all Third Party
Claims arising from or related to Healthcare Company's use of the
registration, license or permit or other rights granted to the Vencor Group by
Governmental Authorities.
 
  (d) If Healthcare Company elects to pursue any claim or right relating to
the Healthcare Business, Vencor, upon request and at Healthcare Company's
expense, shall use reasonable efforts to make available to Healthcare Company
such assistance in support of the prosecution of such litigation as Healthcare
Company may reasonably request, including without limitation, the right to
assert, as needed, in the name of Vencor or any member of the Vencor Group
such rights and claims that Vencor or such member would be or would have been
permitted to assert in such litigation had the Distribution not occurred;
provided, however, that no member of the Vencor Group shall be required to
take any action, refrain from taking any action or make available any
assistance if doing so would have the effect of increasing Liabilities of the
Vencor Group.
 
  4.02 Receivables Collection And Other Payments. If after the Distribution
Date, either party receives payments belonging to the other party, the
recipient shall promptly account for and remit same to the other party.
 
                                   ARTICLE V
 
                             ACCESS TO INFORMATION
 
  5.01 Provision of Corporate Records. From and after the Distribution Date,
all such books, records and copies (where copies are delivered in lieu of
originals) transferred to Healthcare Company Group whether or not delivered
shall be the property of the Healthcare Company Group; provided, however, that
all such Information contained in such books, records or copies relating to
the Vencor Group, the Real Estate Business, the Vencor Liabilities, or the
Ancillary Agreements shall be subject to the applicable confidentiality
provisions and restricted use provisions, if any, contained in this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements and any confidentiality restrictions imposed by
law. Vencor, if it so elects, may retain copies of any original books and
records delivered to Healthcare Company along with those original books and
records of the Vencor Group authorized herein to be retained; provided,
however, that all such Information contained in such books, records or copies
(whether or not delivered by the Vencor Group) relating to the Healthcare
Company Group, the Healthcare Company Business, and the Healthcare Company
Liabilities shall be subject to the applicable confidentiality provisions
 
                                     A-14
<PAGE>
 
and restricted use provisions, if any, contained in this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements and any confidentiality restrictions imposed by law.
 
  5.02 Access to Information. In addition to the provisions set forth in
Section 5.01 above, from and after the Distribution Date and upon reasonable
notice, each of the Vencor Group and the Healthcare Company Group shall afford
to the other and to the other's Representatives at the expense of the other
party, reasonable access and duplicating rights during normal business hours
to all Information developed or obtained prior to the Distribution Date within
such party's possession relating to the other party or its businesses, its
former businesses, its assets, its Liabilities, or the Ancillary Agreements,
insofar as such access is reasonably requested by such other party, but
subject to the applicable confidentiality provisions and restricted use
provisions, if any, contained in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements
and any confidentiality restrictions imposed by law. In addition, without
limiting the foregoing, Information may be requested under this Section 5.02
for audit, accounting, claims, intellectual property protection, litigation
and Tax purposes, as well as for purposes of fulfilling disclosure and
reporting obligations. In each case, the requesting party agrees to cooperate
with the other party to minimize the risk of unreasonable interference with
the other party's business. In the event access to any Information otherwise
required to be granted herein or in the Ancillary Agreements is restricted by
law or otherwise, the parties agree to take such actions as are reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to have such restrictions removed or to seek an
exemption therefrom or to otherwise provide the requesting party with the
benefit of the Information to the same extent such actions would have been
taken on behalf of the requesting party had such a restriction existed and the
Distribution not occurred.
 
  5.03 Litigation Support And Production of Witnesses. After the Distribution
Date, each member of the Vencor Group and the Healthcare Company Group shall
use reasonable efforts to provide assistance to the other with respect to
Litigation Matters and to make available to the other, upon written request:
(a) such employees who have expertise or knowledge with respect to the other
party's business or products or matters in litigation, for the purpose of
consultation and/or as a witness; and (b) its directors, officers, other
employees and agents, as witnesses, in each case to the extent that the
requesting party believes any such Person may reasonably be useful or required
in connection with any legal, administrative or other proceedings in which the
requesting party may from time to time be involved. The employing party agrees
that such consultant or witness shall be made available to the requesting
party upon reasonable notice to the same extent that such employing party
would have made such consultant or witness available if the Distribution had
not occurred. The requesting party agrees to cooperate with the employing
party in giving consideration to business demands of such Persons.
 
  5.04 Reimbursement. Except to the extent otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, a party providing Information,
consultant, or witness services to the other party under this Article V shall
be entitled to receive from the recipient, upon the presentation of invoices
therefor, payments for such amounts, relating to supplies, disbursements,
travel expenses, and other out-of-pocket expenses (including the direct and
indirect costs of employees providing consulting and expert witness services
in connection with litigation, but excluding direct and indirect costs of
employees who provide Information or are fact witnesses) as may be reasonably
incurred in providing such Information, consulting or witness services.
 
  5.05 Retention of Records. Except as otherwise required by law or agreed in
writing, or as otherwise provided in the Tax Sharing Agreement, each member of
the Vencor Group and the Healthcare Company Group shall retain, for a period
of five years or such longer period as may be required by law, this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements, all significant Information in such party's
possession or under its control relating to the business, former business,
assets or Liabilities of the other party or this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements and, after the expiration of such applicable period, prior to
destroying or disposing of any of such Information, (a) the party proposing to
dispose of or destroy any such Information shall provide no less than 30 days'
prior written notice to the other party, specifying the Information proposed
to be destroyed or disposed of, and (b) if, prior to the scheduled date for
such destruction or disposal, the other party requests in writing that any of
the Information proposed to be destroyed or disposed of be delivered to such
other party, the party proposing to dispose of or destroy such Information
promptly shall arrange for the delivery of the requested Information to a
location specified by, and at the expense of, the requesting party.

  5.06 Privileged Information. In furtherance of the rights and obligations of
the parties set forth in this Article V:
 
  (a) Each party hereto acknowledges that (i) each of the Vencor Group on the
one hand, and the Healthcare Company Group on the other hand, has or may
obtain Information regarding a member of the other Group, or any of its
operations, employees, assets or Liabilities (whether in documents or stored
in any other form or known to its employees or agents), as applicable, that is
or may be protected from disclosure pursuant to the attorney-client privilege,
the work product doctrine or other applicable privileges ("Privileged
Information"); (ii) there are a number of actual, threatened or future
litigations, investigations, proceedings (including arbitration proceedings),
claims or other legal matters that have been or may be asserted by or against,
or otherwise affect, each or both of Vencor and Healthcare Company (or members
of either Group) ("Litigation Matters"); (iii) Vencor and Healthcare Company
have a common legal interest in Litigation Matters, in the Privileged
Information, and in the preservation of the confidential status of the
Privileged Information, in each case relating to the Real Estate Business or
the Healthcare Business or any former businesses, the assets or the
Liabilities of each party as it or they existed prior to the Distribution Date
or relating to or arising in connection with the relationship between the
constituent elements of the Groups on or prior to the Distribution Date; and
(iv) Vencor and Healthcare Company intend that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and any transfer of Privileged
Information in connection herewith or therewith shall not operate as a waiver
of any potentially applicable privilege.
 
  (b) Each of Vencor and Healthcare Company agrees, on behalf of itself and
each member of the Group of which it is a member, not to disclose or otherwise
waive any privilege attaching to any Privileged Information relating to the
Real Estate Business or the Healthcare Business or any former businesses or
assets or Liabilities of either party or relating to or arising in connection
with the relationship between the Groups on or prior to the Distribution Date,
without providing prompt written notice to and obtaining the prior written
consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and
shall not be withheld if the other party certifies that such disclosure is to
be made in response to a likely threat of suspension or debarment or similar
action; provided, however, that Vencor and Healthcare Company may make such
disclosure or waiver with respect to Privileged Information if such Privileged
Information relates, in the case of Vencor, solely to the Real Estate Business
or the Vencor Liabilities as each existed prior to the Distribution Date or,
in the case of Healthcare Company, solely to the Healthcare Business, its
former businesses (other than the Real Estate Business) or the Healthcare
Company Liabilities, as each existed prior to the Distribution Date. In the
event of a disagreement between any member of the Vencor Group and any member
of the Healthcare Company Group concerning the reasonableness of withholding
such consent, no disclosure shall be made prior to (i) a final, nonappealable
resolution of such disagreement by a court of competent jurisdiction if such
requirement to disclose is part of a pending judicial proceeding; or (ii) a
final determination by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to Article VI if such
requirement to disclose is not part of a pending judicial proceeding.
 
  (c) Upon any member of the Vencor Group or any member of the Healthcare
Company Group receiving any subpoena or other compulsory disclosure notice
from a court, other governmental agency or otherwise which requests disclosure
of Privileged Information, in each case relating to the Real Estate Business
or the Vencor Liabilities (in the case of the Healthcare Company Group) or the
Healthcare Business, its former businesses (other than the Real Estate
Business) or the Healthcare Company Liabilities (in the case of the Vencor
Group), as they or it existed prior to the Distribution Date or relating to or
arising in connection with the relationship between the constituent elements
of the Groups on or prior to the Distribution Date, the recipient of the
notice shall promptly provide to Vencor, in the case of receipt by a member of
the Healthcare Company Group, or to Healthcare Company, in the case of receipt
by a member of the Vencor Group, a copy of such notice, the intended response,
and all materials or information relating to the other Group that might be
disclosed. In the event of a disagreement as to the intended response or
disclosure, unless and until the disagreement is resolved as provided in
paragraph (b) above, Vencor and Healthcare Company shall cooperate to assert
all defenses to disclosure claimed by either Group, at the cost and expense of
the Group claiming such defense to disclosure, and shall not disclose any
disputed documents or information until all legal defenses and claims of
privilege have been finally determined.

  5.07 Confidentiality. From and after the Distribution Date, each of Vencor
and Healthcare Company shall hold, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its employees, Affiliates and Representatives to hold, in strict
confidence all Information concerning or belonging to the other party obtained
by it prior to the Distribution Date or furnished to it by such other party
pursuant to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and shall not release
or disclose such Information to any other Person, except its Representatives,
who shall be bound by the provisions of this Section 5.07; provided, however,
that Vencor and Healthcare Company and their respective employees, Affiliates
and Representatives may disclose such Information to the extent that (a)
disclosure is compelled by judicial or administrative process or, in the
opinion of such party's counsel, by other requirements of law, or (b) such
party can show that such Information was (i) available to such party after the
Distribution Date from Third Party sources other than employees or former
employees of either party, their Affiliates, former Affiliates,
Representatives or former Representatives, on a nonconfidential basis prior to
its disclosure to such party after the Distribution Date by the other party,
(ii) in the public domain through no fault of such party, (iii) lawfully
acquired by such party from Third Party sources other than employees or former
employees of either party, their Affiliates, former Affiliates,
Representatives or former Representatives, after the time that it was
furnished to such party pursuant to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements
or (iv) is independently discovered or developed after the Distribution Date
by employees of such party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Vencor and
Healthcare Company and their respective Representatives and Affiliates shall
be deemed to have satisfied its obligations under this Section 5.07 with
respect to any Information if it exercises the same care with regard to such
Information as it takes to preserve confidentiality for its own similar
Information.

  6.01 Mediation. In the event of a controversy, dispute or claim arising out
of, in connection with, or in relation to the interpretation, performance,
nonperformance, validity or breach of this Agreement or of any Ancillary
Agreements or otherwise arising out of, or in any way related to this

or thereby, including, without limitation, any claim based on contract, tort,
statute or constitution (collectively, "Agreement Disputes"), the general
counsels (or other chief legal officers) of the relevant parties shall
negotiate in good faith for a reasonable period of time to settle such
Agreement Dispute.
 
  6.02 Arbitration. If after a reasonable period of time the relevant general
counsels (or other chief legal officers) are unable to settle an Agreement
Dispute as provided in Section 6.01, such Agreement Dispute shall be settled
by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in
accordance with its applicable Rules for Commercial Arbitration and judgment
on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof. Any such arbitration shall be commenced and all the
proceedings thereof conducted in Louisville, Kentucky.

understands and agrees that no member of the Vencor Group is, in this
Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, representing or warranting to the
Healthcare Company Group in any way as to the Healthcare Business, the
Healthcare Company Liabilities, or the Healthcare Company Assets, or as to any
consents or approvals required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, it being agreed and understood as
between the Groups, the members of the Healthcare Company Group shall take all
of the Healthcare Business "as is, where is" and that, except as provided in
this Section 7.01 or in Section 4.01, the members of Healthcare
 
                                     A-17
<PAGE>
 
Company Group shall bear the economic and legal risk that conveyances of the
Healthcare Business shall prove to be insufficient or that the title of any
member of the Healthcare Company Group to any Healthcare Business shall be
other than good and marketable and free from encumbrances. Real property in
the United States being transferred to Healthcare Company will be conveyed by
Special Warranty Deed, in recordable form and warranting title to be free and
clear from all lawful claims of those claiming by, through or under Vencor,
but not otherwise; provided, however, such Special Warranty Deed shall be
subject to deed restrictions, easements, rights-of-way, and all other matters
of record.

     (a) Minimum Rent:  The annual sum of $_______, payable in advance in equal,

Fixed Term and each Extended Term; provided, however, that the first monthly
payment of Minimum Rent shall be payable on the Commencement Date and that the
first and last monthly payments of Minimum Rent shall be prorated as to any

14.6 below).  In the event that this Lease is terminated as to a particular
Leased Property, or a substitute master lease is entered into as to a particular
Leased Property pursuant to the provisions of this Lease, the Minimum Rent
payable hereunder shall be reduced by the amount opposite the applicable Leased
Property on Exhibit C annexed hereto.  The amount of Minimum Rent payable
            ---------

         ------------------                                               
respect to the applicable Leased Property, Tenant shall pay and discharge as and
when due and payable the following (collectively "Additional Charges"):
                                                  ------------------

                    any fine, penalty, interest or cost may be added for non-

                    authorities where

                    copies of official receipts or other satisfactory proof
                    evidencing such payments. If any such Imposition may, at the
                    option of the taxpayer, lawfully be paid in installments
                    (whether or not interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance
                    of such Imposition), subject to the terms of any applicable
                    Facility Mortgage, Tenant may exercise the option to pay
                    same (and any accrued interest on the unpaid balance of such
                    Imposition) in installments and, in such event, shall pay
                    such installments during the Term as the same may become due
                    and before any fine, penalty, premium, further interest or
                    cost may be added thereto.

                    (2) Utility Charges.  Tenant shall pay all charges for
                        ---------------                                   
                    electricity, power, gas, oil, water, sanitary and storm
                    sewer, refuse collection, medical waste disposal and other
                    utilities used or consumed in connection with each Leased
                    Property during the Term.

                    (3) Insurance Premiums.  Tenant shall pay all premiums for
                        ------------------                                    
                    the insurance coverage required to be maintained pursuant to
                    Article XIII hereof.

                    (4) Other Charges.  Tenant shall pay all other amounts,
                        -------------                                      
                    liabilities and obligations that Tenant assumes or agrees to
                    pay under this Lease, including, without limitation, all
                    agreements to indemnify Lessor under Sections 12.1 and 24.1
                    and any and all fees, costs and expenses incurred by Tenant
                    in the operation of its business at the Facility.

                    (5) Late Payment of Rent.  If any installment of Minimum
                        --------------------                                
                    Rent, or Additional Charges (but only as to those Additional
                    Charges which are payable directly to Lessor or Lessor's
                    agent or assignee) shall not be paid within five (5)
                    Business Days after its due date, Tenant will pay to Lessor
                    on demand a late charge (to the extent permitted by law)
                    computed at the Overdue Rate (or at the maximum rate
                    permitted by law, whichever is the lesser) on the amount of
                    such installment, from the due date of such installment to
                    the date of payment thereof.

To the extent that Tenant pays any Additional Charges to Lessor pursuant to any
requirement of this Lease, Tenant shall be relieved of its obligation to pay
such Additional Charges to the entity to which they would otherwise be due.  If
any Facility Mortgagee shall so require, or if any Additional Charges shall not
be paid to a third party 

                                       12

payee within five (5) Business Days after its due date, Lessor may at any time
thereafter, at Lessor's option, require Tenant to deposit into an escrow account
under the sole dominion and control of Lessor (or the applicable Facility
Mortgagee), on the first day of each and every month, an amount sufficient to
insure that such escrow account shall contain an amount sufficient to make such
payment on its next due date, in which event Lessor shall make all future
payments for such expense from the escrow account. In the event of any failure
by Tenant to pay any Additional Charges when due, Tenant shall promptly pay and
discharge, as Additional Charges, every fine, penalty, interest and cost that
may be added for non-payment or late payment of such items. Lessor shall have
all legal, equitable and contractual rights, powers and remedies provided either
in this Lease or by statute or otherwise in the case of non-payment of the
Minimum Rent.

      Section 3.2.  Net Lease.  The Rent shall be paid absolutely net to Lessor,
                    ---------                                                   
without any rights of deduction, set-off or abatement, so that this Lease shall
yield to Lessor the full amount of the installments of Minimum Rent and
Additional Charges, throughout the Term, subject to any other provisions of this
Lease which expressly provide for termination of this Lease with respect to a
Leased Property.

      Section 4.1.  Payment of Impositions.  Subject to Article XII relating to
                    ----------------------                                     
permitted contests, Tenant will pay all Impositions as set forth in Section
3.1(b)(1). Tenant's obligation to pay such Impositions shall be deemed
absolutely fixed upon the date such Impositions become a lien upon the Leased
Property or any part thereof. Lessor, at  its expense, shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, prepare and file all tax returns and reports as may
be required by governmental authorities in respect of Lessor's net income, gross
receipts, franchise taxes and taxes on its capital stock, and Tenant, at its
expense, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations,
prepare and file all other tax returns and reports in respect of any Imposition
as may be required by governmental authorities.  If any refund shall be due from
any taxing authority in respect of any Imposition paid by Tenant, the same shall
be paid over to or retained by Tenant if no Event of Default shall have occurred
hereunder and be continuing.  Any such funds retained by Lessor due to an Event
of Default shall be applied as provided in Article XVI.  Lessor and Tenant
shall, upon request of the other, provide such data as is maintained by the
party to whom the request is made with respect to the Leased Property as may be
necessary to prepare any required returns and reports. In the event governmental
authorities classify any property covered by this Master Lease as personal
property, Tenant shall file all personal property tax returns in such
jurisdictions where it may legally so file.  Lessor, to the extent it possesses
the same, and Tenant, to the extent it possesses the same, will provide the
other party, upon request, with cost and depreciation records necessary for
filing returns for any property so classified as personal property.  Where
Lessor is legally required to file personal property 

                                       13
<PAGE>
 
tax returns, Tenant will be provided with copies of assessment notices
indicating a value in excess of the reported value in sufficient time for Tenant
to file a protest. Tenant may, upon notice to Lessor, at Tenant's option and at
Tenant's sole cost and expense, protest, appeal, or institute such other
proceedings as Tenant may deem appropriate to effect a reduction of real estate
or personal property assessments and Lessor, at Tenant's expense as aforesaid,
shall fully cooperate with Tenant in such protest, appeal, or other action.
Billings for reimbursement by Tenant to Lessor of personal property taxes shall
be accompanied by copies of a bill therefor and payments thereof which identify
the personal property with respect to which such payments are made.

      Section 4.2.  Notice of Impositions.  Lessor shall give prompt notice to
                    ---------------------                                     
Tenant of all Impositions payable by Tenant hereunder of which Lessor at any
time has knowledge, but Lessor's failure to give any such notice shall in no way
diminish Tenant's obligations hereunder to pay such Impositions.

      Section 4.3.  Adjustment of Impositions.  Impositions imposed in respect
                    -------------------------                                 
of the tax-fiscal period during which the Term terminates shall be adjusted and
prorated between Lessor and Tenant, whether or not such Imposition is imposed
before or after such termination, and Tenant's obligation to pay its prorated
share thereof shall survive such termination.

specifically provided in this Master Lease, Tenant, to the extent permitted by
law, shall remain bound by this Lease in accordance with its terms and shall
neither take any action without the consent of Lessor to modify, surrender or
terminate the same, nor seek nor be entitled to any abatement, deduction,
deferment or reduction of Rent, or set-off against the Rent, nor shall the
respective obligations of Lessor and Tenant be otherwise affected by reason of
(a) any damage to, or destruction of, any Leased Property or any portion thereof
from whatever cause or any Taking of any Leased Property or any portion thereof,
(b) the interruption or discontinuance of any service or utility servicing any
Leased Property (c) the lawful or unlawful prohibition of, or restriction upon,
Tenant's use of any Leased Property, or any portion thereof, the interference
with such use by any person, corporation, partnership or other entity, or by
reason of eviction by paramount title, (d) any claim which Tenant has or might
have against Lessor or by reason of any default or breach of any warranty by
Lessor under this Master Lease or any other agreement between Lessor and Tenant,
or to which Lessor and Tenant are parties, (e) any bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution, winding up
or other proceedings affecting Lessor or any assignee or transferee of Lessor,
or (f) for any other cause whether similar or dissimilar to any of the foregoing
other than a discharge of Tenant from any such obligations as a matter of law.

Property or any portion thereof, or (ii) entitle Tenant to any abatement,
reduction, suspension or deferment of the Rent or other sums payable by Tenant
hereunder.  The obligations of Lessor and Tenant hereunder shall be separate and
independent covenants and agreements and the Rent and all other sums payable by
Tenant hereunder shall continue to be payable in all events unless the
obligations to pay the same shall be terminated by termination of this Lease as

provided hereinbelow), at its expense, install, affix or assemble or place on
any parcels of the Land or in any of the Leased Improvements, any items of
Tenant's Personal Property and Tenant may, subject to the  conditions set forth

All of Tenant's Personal Property not removed by Tenant within twenty-one days

          Section 7.2.2.  After the Commencement Date and during the entire
Term, Tenant shall use each Leased Property and the Leased Improvements thereof
as a hospital or a nursing home and each Facility that is being used as a
hospital on the Commencement Date shall continue to be used as a hospital during

permitted to be made of the applicable Leased Property, and no acts shall be
done, that will cause the cancellation of any insurance policy covering such
Leased Property or any part thereof, nor shall Tenant sell or otherwise provide
to residents or patients therein, or permit to be kept, used or sold in or about
such Leased Property any article which may be prohibited by law or by the
standard form of fire insurance policies, or any other insurance policies
required to be carried hereunder, or fire underwriters regulations. Tenant
shall, at its sole cost, comply with all of the requirements pertaining to the
applicable Leased Property or other improvements of any insurance board,
association, organization or company necessary for the maintenance of insurance,
as herein provided, covering the Leased Property and Tenant's Personal Property.

          Section 7.2.3.  Tenant shall during the Term operate continuously each
Leased Property as a provider of health care services in accordance with its
Primary Intended Use and maintain its certifications for reimbursement and
licensure and its accreditation, if compliance with accreditation standards is
required to maintain the operations of the Facility and if a failure to comply
would adversely affect operations of the Facility.

          Section 7.2.4.  Tenant shall not commit or suffer to be committed any
waste on any Leased Property, or in any Facility, nor shall Tenant cause or
permit any nuisance thereon. Tenant shall not take or omit to take any action,
the taking or omission of which may materially impair the value or the
usefulness of such Leased Property or any part thereof for its Primary Intended
Use.

          Section 7.2.5.  Tenant shall neither suffer nor permit any Leased
Property or any portion thereof, including any Capital Addition whether or not

as (i) might reasonably tend to impair Lessor's (or Tenant's, as the case may
be) title thereto or to any portion thereof, or (ii) may reasonably make
possible a claim or claims of adverse usage or adverse possession by the public,
as such, or of implied dedication of the applicable Leased Property or any

documentation such party reasonably shall deem necessary and an Officer's
Certificate stating that such grant, release, dedication, transfer, petition or
amendment is not detrimental to the proper conduct of the business of Tenant on

Requirements and Insurance Requirements in respect of the use, operation,
maintenance, repair and restoration of the applicable Leased Property, whether
or not compliance therewith shall require structural changes in any of the
Leased Improvements or interfere with the use and enjoyment of such Leased
Property and (b) procure, maintain and comply with all licenses, certificates of
need and other authorizations required for any use of the applicable Leased
Property and Tenant's Personal Property then being made, and for the proper
erection, installation, operation and maintenance of the applicable Leased
Property or any part thereof, including without limitation any Capital
Additions.  In the event that Tenant shall receive notice from any state
authority that Tenant is not in compliance with any license, permit, approval,
certificate of need or certification for reimbursement under medicare or
medicaid (with respect to any Facility that participates in such programs),
Tenant shall promptly send notice to Lessor and Tenant shall remedy any
condition causing such noncompliance no later than thirty (30) days after Tenant
shall have received such notice.

In addition, Tenant shall promptly send to Lessor any material deficiency report
Tenant receives from any state or federal licensure board or certification
authority with respect to any Facility if Tenant has not cured such deficiency
within the applicable cure period.

      Section 8.2.  Legal Requirement Covenants.  Tenant covenants and agrees
                    ---------------------------                              
that none of the Leased Properties nor any of Tenant's Personal Property shall
be used for any unlawful purpose.  Tenant shall acquire and maintain all
licenses, certificates, permits, provider agreements and other authorizations
and approvals needed to operate the applicable Leased Property in its customary
manner for the Primary Intended Use, and any other use conducted on such Leased
Property as may be permitted from time to time hereunder.  Tenant further
covenants and agrees that Tenant's use of each Leased Property and maintenance,
alteration, and operation of the same, and all parts thereof, shall at all times
conform to all applicable local, state, and federal laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations unless the same are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unlawful.  Tenant may, however, upon prior written notice to Lessor, contest the
legality or applicability of any such law, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any
licensure or certification decision if Tenant maintains such action in good
faith, with due diligence, without prejudice to Lessor's rights hereunder, and
at Tenant's own expense. If by the terms of any such law, ordinance, rule or
regulation, compliance therewith pending the prosecution of any such proceeding
may legally be delayed without the occurrence of any lien, charge or liability
of any kind against the applicable Facility or Tenant's leasehold interest
therein and without subjecting Tenant or Lessor to any liability, civil or
criminal, for failure so to comply therewith, Tenant may delay compliance
therewith until the final determination of such proceeding. If any lien, charge
or civil or criminal liability would be incurred by reason of any such delay,
Tenant, on the prior written consent of Lessor, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, may nonetheless contest as aforesaid and delay as
aforesaid provided that such delay would not subject Lessor to criminal
liability and Tenant both (a) furnishes to Lessor security reasonably
satisfactory to Lessor against any loss or injury by reason of such contest or
delay, and (b) prosecutes the contest with due diligence and in good faith.

private roadways, sidewalks and curbs appurtenant thereto and which are under
Tenant's control (and Tenant's Personal Property) in good order and repair,
reasonable wear and tear excepted (whether or not the need for such repairs
occurs as a result of Tenant's use, any prior use, the elements or the age of
such Leased Property, Tenant's Personal Property, or any portion thereof), and,
except as otherwise provided in Article XIV, shall promptly make all necessary
and appropriate repairs and replacements thereto, 

                                       19

of every kind and nature, whether interior or exterior, structural or non-
structural, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen or arising by
reason of a condition existing prior to the commencement of the Term (concealed
or otherwise). All repairs shall, to the extent reasonably achievable, be made
in good, workmanlike and first-class manner, in accordance with all applicable
federal, state and local statutes, ordinances, by-laws, codes, rules and
regulations relating to such work. Tenant will not take or omit to take any
action the taking or omission of which might materially impair the value or
usefulness of the applicable Leased Property or any part thereof for its Primary
Intended Use.

          (b) Lessor shall not under any circumstances be required to build or
rebuild any improvements on any Leased Property, or to make any repairs,
replacements, alterations, restorations or renewals of any nature or description
to the applicable Leased Property, whether ordinary or extraordinary, structural
or non-structural, foreseen or unforeseen, or to make any expenditure whatsoever
with respect thereto, in connection with this Lease, or to maintain any Leased
Property in any way, except as expressly provided herein.  Tenant hereby waives,
to the extent permitted by law, the right to make repairs at the expense of
Lessor pursuant to any law in effect at the time of the execution of this Lease
or thereafter enacted.

          (c) Except as expressly set forth in this Lease, nothing contained in
this Lease and no action or inaction by Lessor shall be construed as (i)
constituting the consent or request of Lessor, express or implied, to any
contractor, subcontractor, laborer, materialman or vendor to or for the
performance of any labor or services or the furnishing of any materials or other
property for the construction, alteration, addition, repair or demolition of or
to any Leased Property or any part thereof, or (ii) giving Tenant any right,
power or permission to contract for or permit the performance of any labor or
services or the furnishing of any materials or other property in such fashion as
would permit the making of any claim against Lessor in respect thereof or to
make any agreement that may create, or in any way be the basis for, any right,
title, interest, lien, claim or other encumbrance upon the estate of Lessor in
any Leased Property, or any portion thereof.

          (d) Tenant will, upon the expiration or prior termination of the Term,
vacate and surrender the applicable Leased Property to Lessor in the condition
in which such Leased Property was originally received from Lessor, except as
repaired, rebuilt, restored, altered or added to as permitted or required by the
provisions of this Lease and except for ordinary wear and tear (subject to the
obligation of Tenant to maintain the Leased Property in good order and repair
during the entire Term).

Improvements on any Leased Property shall, at any time, encroach upon any

violate the agreements or conditions contained in any lawful restrictive
covenant or other agreement affecting such Leased Property, or any part thereof,
or shall impair the rights of others under any easement or right-of-way to which
the Leased Property is subject, then promptly upon the request of Lessor or at
the behest of any person affected by any such encroachment, violation or
impairment, Tenant shall, at its expense, subject to its right to contest the
existence of any encroachment, violation or impairment and in such case, in the
event of any adverse final determination, either (i) obtain valid and effective
waivers or settlements of all claims, liabilities and damages resulting from
each such encroachment, violation or impairment, whether the same shall affect
Lessor or Tenant or (ii) make such changes in the Leased Improvements, and take
such other actions, as Tenant in good faith exercise of its judgment deems
reasonably practicable, to remove such encroachment, and to end such violation
or impairment, including, if necessary, the alteration of any of the Leased
Improvements, and in any event take all such actions as may be necessary in
order to be able to continue the operation of the Leased Improvements for the
Primary Intended Use substantially in the manner and to the extent the Leased
Improvements were operated prior to the assertion of such violation or
encroachment.  Any such alteration shall be made in conformity with the
applicable requirements of Article X.  Tenant's obligations under this Section
9.2 shall be in addition to and shall in no way discharge or diminish any
obligation of any insurer under any policy of title or other insurance and
Tenant shall be entitled to a credit for any sums recovered by Lessor under any
such policy of title or other insurance.

      Section 10.1.  Construction of Capital Additions to the Leased Property.
                     -------------------------------------------------------- 
If no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Tenant shall have
the right, upon and subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, to
construct or install Capital Additions on any Leased Property.  Prior to
commencing construction of any Capital Addition, Tenant shall submit to Lessor
in writing a proposal setting forth in reasonable detail any proposed Capital
Addition and shall provide to Lessor such plans and specifications, permits,
licenses, contracts, construction schedules, construction budgets and other
information concerning the proposed Capital Addition as Lessor may reasonably
request showing in reasonable detail the scope and nature of the Capital
Addition that Tenant desires to construct (collectively the "Plans and
                                                             ---------

is referred to in the architectural profession as "design development drawings"
as opposed to working or biddable drawings. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, such proposal shall indicate the approximate projected cost of
constructing such Capital Addition and the use or uses to which it will be put.
Prior to commencing construction of any Capital Addition, Tenant shall first
request Lessor to provide funds to pay for such Capital Addition in accordance
with the provisions of Section 10.3. If Lessor declines or is unable to provide
such financing on terms acceptable to Tenant, Tenant shall provide to Lessor,
prior to commencement of any construction, proof reasonably acceptable to Lessor
that Tenant has sufficient capital to complete the construction. Furthermore, no
Capital Addition shall be made which would tie in or connect any Leased
Improvements on the Leased Property with any other improvements on property
adjacent to the Leased Property (and not part of the land covered by this Master
Lease) including, without limitation, tie-ins of buildings or other structures
or utilities, unless Tenant shall have obtained the prior written approval of
Lessor, which approval in Lessor's sole discretion may be granted, withheld or
conditioned. Tenant shall reimburse Lessor for all costs and expenses incurred
by Lessor in reviewing the proposal and the Plans and Specifications for a
Capital Addition and for inspecting the applicable Leased Property and otherwise
monitoring the construction of the Capital Addition.

      Section 10.2.  Capital Additions Financed by Tenant.  If Tenant provides
                     ------------------------------------                     
or arranges such financing, there shall be no adjustment in the Minimum Rent by
reason of any such Capital Addition.

      Section 10.3.  Capital Additions Financed by Lessor.
                     ------------------------------------ 

          (a) Tenant shall request that Lessor provide or arrange financing for
a Capital Addition by providing to Lessor such information about the Capital
Addition as Lessor may request including without limitation all information
referred to in Section 10.1 above.  Lessor may, but shall be under no obligation
to, obtain the funds necessary to meet the request.  Within sixty (60) days
after receipt of a request, Lessor shall notify Tenant as to whether it will
finance the proposed Capital Addition and, if so, the terms and conditions upon
which it would do so, including the terms of any amendment to this Master Lease.
In no event shall the portion of the projected Capital Additions Cost comprised
of land, if any, materials, labor charges and fixtures be less than ninety
percent (90%) of the total amount of such cost.  Tenant may withdraw its request
by notice to Lessor at any time before or after receipt of Lessor's terms and
conditions.  If Tenant desires to accept Lessor's offer to finance the proposed
Capital Addition, Tenant shall notify Lessor within thirty (30) days after
Tenant's receipt of Lessor's offer.

          (b) If Lessor agrees to finance the proposed Capital Addition, Tenant
shall provide Lessor with the following prior to any advance of funds:

               (i) all customary or other reasonably required loan
     documentation;

               (ii) any information, certificates, licenses, permits or
     documents requested by either Lessor or any third party lender with whom
     Lessor has agreed or may agree to provide financing which are necessary to
     confirm that Tenant will be able to use the Capital Addition upon
     completion thereof in accordance with the Primary Intended Use, including
     all required federal, state or local government licenses and approvals;

               (iii)  an Officer's Certificate and, if requested, a certificate
     from Tenant's architect, setting forth in reasonable detail the projected
     (or actual, if available) cost of the proposed Capital Addition;

               (iv) an amendment to this Master Lease, duly executed and
     acknowledged, in form and substance satisfactory to Lessor, providing for
     any change in the Rent, the legal description of the Land, and other
     provisions as may be necessary or appropriate;

               (v) a deed (in the customary form used to convey commercial
     properties within the relevant jurisdiction) conveying title to Lessor to
     any land acquired for the purpose of constructing the Capital Additions
     free and clear of any liens or encumbrances except those approved by
     Lessor, accompanied by a final as-built survey thereof satisfactory to
     Lessor if reasonably required by Lessor;

     covering the applicable Leased Property or commitments therefore
     satisfactory in form and substance to Lessor (A) updating the same without
     any additional exception except as may be permitted by Lessor; and (B)
     increasing the coverage thereof by an amount equal to the Fair Market Value
     of the Capital Addition (except to the extent covered by the owner's policy
     of title insurance referred to in subparagraph (vii) below);

               (vii)  if appropriate, (A) an owner's policy of title insurance
     insuring fee simple title to any land conveyed to Lessor pursuant to
     subparagraph (iv) free and clear of all liens and encumbrances except those
     approved by Lessor and (B) a lender's policy of title insurance
     satisfactory in form and substance to Lessor and the lending institution
     advancing any portion of the Capital Additions Cost;

               (viii)  if deemed necessary by Lessor, an M.A.I. appraisal of the
     Leased Property indicating that the value of the applicable Leased Property
     upon completion of the Capital Addition exceeds the Fair Market Value
     thereof prior thereto by an amount not less than 95% of the Capital
     Additions Cost; and

               (ix) such other certificates (including, but not limited to,
     endorsements increasing the insurance coverage, if any, at the time
     required by Section 13.1), documents, opinions of counsel, appraisals,
     surveys, certified copies of duly adopted resolutions of the Board of
     Directors of Tenant authorizing the execution and

     delivery of the lease amendment and any other instruments as may be
     reasonably required by Lessor and any lending institution advancing or
     reimbursing Tenant for any portion of the Capital Additions Cost.

          (c) Upon making a Request to finance a Capital Addition, if and when
such financing is actually consummated, Tenant shall pay or agree to pay all

commencement and continuation of such proceedings shall suspend the collection
thereof from Lessor and from the applicable Leased Property, (b) neither the
applicable Leased Property nor any Rent therefrom nor any part thereof or

give such reasonable security as may be demanded by Lessor to insure ultimate
payment of the same and to prevent any sale or forfeiture of the affected Leased

however, the provisions of this Article XII shall not be construed to permit
Tenant to contest the payment of Rent (except as to contests concerning the
method of computation or the basis of levy of any Imposition or the basis for
the assertion of any other claim) or any other sums payable by Tenant to Lessor
hereunder, (f) in the case of an Insurance Requirement, the coverage required by

in any such contest, and, if reasonably requested by Tenant or if Lessor so
desires, Lessor shall join as a party therein.  Tenant shall indemnify and save
Lessor harmless against any liability, cost or expense of any kind that may be
imposed upon Lessor in connection with any such contest and any loss resulting
therefrom.

requested, with any Superior Lessor, Leasehold Mortgagee and Facility
Mortgagee(s). If any provision of any Facility Mortgage requires deposits of
insurance premiums to be made with such Facility Mortgagee, Tenant shall either
pay to Lessor monthly the amounts required and Lessor shall transfer such
amounts to each Facility Mortgagee, or, pursuant to written direction by Lessor,
Tenant shall make such deposits directly with such Facility Mortgagee. The
policies on each Leased Property, including the Leased Improvements, and
Fixtures and Tenant's Personal Property, shall insure against the following

policy of comprehensive general accident and public liability insurance (in the
broadest form available, including, without limitation, broad form contractual

herein, shall mean the actual replacement cost of the property requiring
replacement from time to time including an increased cost of construction
endorsement, without reduction or deduction.  Tenant shall have the full
replacement cost redetermined by an accredited appraiser approved by Lessor
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), hereinafter
referred to as "impartial appraiser", every five years during the Term, and at
such other times that either party believes that full replacement cost has
increased or decreased.  Tenant shall forthwith, on receipt of such
determination by such impartial appraiser, give written notice thereof to
Lessor.  The determination of such impartial appraiser shall be final and
binding on the parties hereto, and Tenant shall forthwith increase, or may
decrease, the amount of the insurance carried pursuant to this Section, as the
case may be, to the amount so determined by the impartial appraiser.  Each party

invalidating or making it impossible to secure insurance coverage from
responsible insurance companies doing business in the State) with respect to any
property loss that is covered by insurance then being carried by Lessor or
Tenant, respectively, the party carrying such insurance and suffering said loss
releases the other of and from any and all claims with respect to such loss; and
they further agree that their respective insurance companies shall have no right
of subrogation against the other on account thereof, even though extra premium
may result therefrom.

referred to in this Section shall be written in form satisfactory to Lessor and
any Superior Lessor and Facility Mortgagee and by insurance companies
satisfactory to Lessor and any Superior Lessor and Facility Mortgagee.  Lessor
agrees that it will not unreasonably withhold its approval as to the form of the
policies of insurance or as to the insurance companies selected by Tenant.
Tenant shall pay all of the premiums therefor, and deliver such policies or
certificates thereof to Lessor prior to their effective date (and, with respect
to any renewal policy, at least ten (10) days prior to the expiration of the
existing policy), and in the event of the failure of Tenant either to effect
such insurance in the names herein called for or to pay the premiums  therefor,
or to deliver such policies or certificates thereof to Lessor and each Superior
Lessor and Facility Mortgagee at the times required, Lessor shall be entitled,
but shall have no obligation, to effect such insurance and pay the premiums
therefor, which premiums shall be repayable to Lessor upon written demand
therefor, and failure  to repay the same shall constitute an Event of Default
within the meaning of Section 16.1(c).  Each insurer mentioned in this Section
shall agree, by endorsement on the policy or policies issued by it, or by
independent instrument furnished to Lessor and any Superior Lessor and Facility
Mortgagee, that it will give to Lessor thirty (30) days' written notice before
the policy or policies in question shall be materially altered, allowed to
expire or canceled.

at any time deem the limits of the personal injury or property damage public
liability insurance then carried to be either excessive or insufficient, the
parties shall endeavor to agree on the proper and reasonable limits for such
insurance to be carried; and such insurance shall thereafter be carried with the
limits thus agreed on until further change pursuant to the provisions of this
Section.  If the parties  shall be unable to agree thereon, the proper and
reasonable limits for such insurance to be carried shall be determined by an
impartial third party selected by the parties.  Nothing herein shall permit the
amount of insurance to be reduced below the amount or amounts required by any of
the Facility Mortgages or by any Superior Lessor.

      Section 13.7.  Blanket Policy.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
                     --------------                                           
contained in this Section but subject to any requirements of any applicable
Facility Mortgagee, Tenant's obligations to carry the insurance provided for
herein may be brought within the coverage of a so-called blanket policy or
policies of insurance carried and maintained by Tenant; provided, however, that
the coverage afforded Lessor will not be reduced or diminished or otherwise be
different from that which would exist under a separate policy meeting all other
requirements of this Lease by reason of the use of such blanket policy of
insurance, and provided further that the requirements of this Article XIII are
otherwise satisfied. Without limiting the foregoing, the amounts of insurance
that are required to be maintained pursuant to Section 13.1 shall be on a
Facility by Facility basis.

initiative or pursuant to the request or requirement of any third party, take
out separate insurance concurrent in form of contributing in the event of loss
with that required in this Article, or increase the amounts of any then existing
insurance by securing an additional policy or additional policies, unless all
parties having an insurable interest in the subject matter of the insurance,
including in all cases Lessor and all Superior Lessors and Facility Mortgagees,
are included therein as additional insureds, and the loss is payable under said
insurance in the same manner as losses are payable under this Lease.  Tenant
shall immediately notify Lessor of the taking out of any such separate insurance
or of the increasing of any of the amounts of the then existing insurance by
securing an additional policy or additional policies.

loss or damage to the applicable Leased Property, or any portion thereof, and
insured under any policy of insurance required by Article XIII shall be paid to
Lessor or a third party designated by Lessor and held by Lessor or such third
party in trust and shall be made available for reconstruction or repair, as the
case may be, of any damage to or destruction of the Leased Property, or any
portion thereof, and shall be paid out by Lessor or such third party from time
to time for the reasonable costs of such reconstruction or repair.  Any excess
proceeds of insurance remaining after the completion of the restoration or
reconstruction (or in the event neither Lessor nor Tenant is required or elects
to repair and restore, all such insurance proceeds) shall be retained by Lessor
free and clear upon completion of any such repair and restoration except as
otherwise specifically provided below in  this Article XIV.  All salvage
resulting from any risk covered by insurance shall belong to Lessor except that
any salvage  relating to Tenant's Personal Property shall belong to Tenant.

          Section 14.2.1.  If during the  Term, any Leased Property is totally
or partially destroyed from a risk covered by the insurance described in Article
XIII and the Facility located thereon is rendered Unsuitable for Its Primary
Intended Use, Tenant shall either (A) restore the Facility to substantially the
same condition as existed immediately before the damage or destruction, or (B)
offer to acquire the applicable Leased Property from Lessor for a purchase price
equal to the Fair Market Value Purchase Price of the Leased Property immediately
prior to such damage or destruction. In the event Lessor does not accept
Tenant's offer to so purchase, Tenant may either withdraw its offer to purchase
the Leased Property and proceed to restore the Facility to substantially the
same condition as existed immediately before the damage or destruction 

                                       32

or terminate this Lease as to such Leased Property, in which event Lessor shall
be entitled to retain the insurance proceeds.

          Section 14.2.2.  If during the Term, any Leased Property is totally or
partially destroyed from a risk covered by the insurance described in Article
XIII, but the Facility located thereon is not thereby rendered Unsuitable for
its Primary Intended Use, Tenant shall restore such Facility to substantially
the same condition as existed immediately before the damage or destruction.
Such damage or destruction shall not terminate this Lease as to such Leased
Property.
 
          Section 14.2.3.  If the cost of the repair or restoration of any
Leased Property exceeds the amount of proceeds received by Lessor from the
insurance required under Article XIII, Tenant shall be obligated to contribute
any excess amounts needed to restore such Leased Property.  Such difference
shall be paid by Tenant to Lessor prior to the commencement of construction and
shall be held in trust together with any other insurance proceeds for
application to the cost of repair and restoration.

          Section 14.2.4.  In the event Lessor accepts Tenant's offer to
purchase the applicable Leased Property as provided above, this Lease shall
terminate as to the applicable Leased Property upon payment of the purchase
price and Lessor shall remit to Tenant all insurance proceeds pertaining to such
Leased Property then held in trust by Lessor or any third party designated by
Lessor.

      Section 14.3.  Reconstruction in the Event of Damage or Destruction Not

insurance described in Article XIII, whether or not such damage or destruction
renders the Facility Unsuitable for Its Primary Intended Use, Tenant shall
restore the Facility to substantially the same condition it was in immediately
before such damage or destruction and such damage or destruction shall not
terminate this Lease as to such Leased Property.

other charges required under this Lease shall remain unabated during the Term

termination of this Lease as to the applicable Leased Property pursuant to and
in accordance with Section 14.2, this Lease shall terminate as to such Leased
Property.  The provisions of this Article 14 shall be considered an express
agreement governing any cause of damage or destruction to the applicable Leased
Property and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, no local or state statute,
law, rule, regulation or ordinance in effect during the Term which provides for
such a contingency shall have any application in such case.

      Section 14.7.  Restoration.   If Tenant is required or elects to restore

the applicable Leased Property as provided in Section 14.2 or 14.3, Tenant shall
promptly repair, rebuild, or restore the applicable Leased Property, so as to
make such Leased Property at least equal in value to such Leased Property as it
existed immediately prior to such occurrence and as nearly similar to it in
character as is practicable and reasonable. Prior to commencing such repairs or
rebuilding, Tenant shall submit to Lessor for Lessor's approval, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, Plans and Specifications pursuant
to Section 10.1.  Promptly after receiving Lessor's approval of the Plans and
Specifications, Tenant shall commence repairs and rebuilding and will prosecute
the repairs and rebuilding to completion with diligence, subject, however,  to
strikes, lockouts, acts of God, embargoes, governmental restrictions, and other
causes beyond Tenant's reasonable control.  Subject to the provisions of any
applicable Facility Mortgage, Lessor shall make available to Tenant the
insurance proceeds (net of all administrative and collection costs, including
reasonable attorneys' fees) paid to Lessor for such repair and rebuilding as it
progresses.  Payments shall be made against certification of the architect
approved by Lessor (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld)
responsible for the supervision of the repairs and rebuilding that the work had
been performed substantially in conformance with the Plans and Specifications
and the value of the work in place is equal to not less than 110% of the
aggregate amount advanced by Lessor for the payment of such work.  Prior to the
commencing the repairing and rebuilding, Tenant shall deliver to Lessor for
Lessor's approval a schedule setting forth the estimated monthly draws for such
work.  Subject to the provisions of any applicable Facility Mortgage, Lessor
shall contribute to such payments out of the insurance proceeds being held in
trust by Lessor an amount equal to the proportion that the total net amount so
held by Lessor bears to the total estimated cost of repairing and rebuilding,
multiplied by the payment by Tenant on account of such work.  Lessor may,
however, withhold ten percent (10%) from each payment until the work has been
completed and proof has been furnished to Lessor that no lien or liability 

                                       34

has attached or will attach to the applicable Leased Property or to Lessor in
connection with repairing and rebuilding.

termination which may arise by reason of any damage or destruction of the

under any of the provisions of this Lease.

Section 16.1, Tenant shall, to the extent permitted by law, if required by

faith efforts to relet the Leased Property or any portion thereof, (d) the
reletting of all or any portion thereof, nor (e) the failure of Lessor to
collect or receive any rentals due upon any such reletting, shall relieve Tenant
of its liability and obligations hereunder, all of which shall survive any such
termination, repossession or reletting.  In the event of any such termination,
Tenant shall forthwith pay to Lessor, at Lessor's option, as and for liquidated
and agreed current damages, either:

          (A) the sum of:

               (i) the net present value at the time of award of the unpaid Rent

               unpaid Rent for the balance of the Term without any obligation or
               deemed obligation on the part of Lessor to mitigate damages.

               In making the above determinations, the net present value at the
               time of the award shall be determined by the court having
               jurisdiction thereof using a discount rate equal to the Prime
               Rate,

               or (B)

               without termination of Tenant's right to possession of the Leased
               Property, each installment of Rent and other sums payable by
               Tenant to Lessor under this Lease as the same becomes due and
               payable, which Rent and other sums shall bear interest at the
               maximum annual rate permitted by law from the date when due until
               paid, and Lessor may enforce, by action or otherwise, any other
               term or covenant of this Lease.

 
          In case of any Event of Default, re-entry, expiration and
dispossession by summary proceedings or otherwise, Lessor may (a) relet any
Leased Property or any part or parts thereof, either in the name of Lessor or
otherwise, for a term or terms which may, at Lessor's option, be equal to, less
than or exceed the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of
the Term and may grant concessions or free rent to the extent that Lessor
considers advisable and necessary to relet the same, and (b) make such
reasonable alterations, repairs and decorations in the applicable Leased
Property or any portion thereof as Lessor, in its sole judgment, considers
advisable and necessary for the 

                                       40
<PAGE>
 
purpose of reletting the applicable Leased Property; and the making of such
alterations, repairs and decorations shall not operate or be construed to
release Tenant from liability hereunder as aforesaid. Lessor shall in no event
be liable in any way whatsoever for failure to relet any Leased Property, or, in
the event that any Leased Property is relet, for failure to collect the rent
under such reletting. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Tenant hereby
expressly waives any and all rights of redemption granted under any present or
future laws in the event of Tenant's being evicted or dispossessed, or in the
event of Lessor's obtaining possession of the applicable Leased Property, by
reason of the violation by Tenant of any of the covenants and conditions of this
Lease.

                         -------------------------------                 
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, by including such requirement in
the ten (10) day notice of termination of this Lease given to Tenant by Lessor
pursuant to the provisions of Section 16.1 or by separate notice given by Lessor
to Tenant at any time thereafter prior to the time such Event of Default shall
be cured, Lessor may require Tenant to purchase the Facility that is the subject
of the Event of Default or all Leased Properties on the first Minimum Rent
payment date occurring not less than thirty (30) days after the date of receipt
of, or such later date that is specified in, said notice requiring such purchase
for an amount equal to the higher of the then current Fair Market Value Purchase
Price or the Minimum Repurchase Price of the applicable Leased Property plus all
Rent then due and payable  (excluding the installment of Minimum Rent due on the
purchase date) as of the date of purchase.  If Lessor exercises such right,
Lessor shall convey such Leased Property to Tenant on the date fixed therefor in
accordance with the provisions of Article XVIII upon receipt of the purchase
price therefor and this Lease shall thereupon terminate.  Any purchase by Tenant
of any Leased Property pursuant to this Section shall be in lieu of the damages
specified in Sections 16.3 with respect to such Leased Property.

          Section 16.5.  Waiver.  If this Lease is terminated pursuant to
                         ------                                          
Section 16.1, Tenant waives, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
(a) any right of redemption, re-entry or repossession, (b) any right to a trial
by jury in the event of summary proceedings to enforce the remedies set forth in
this Article XVI, and (c) the benefit of any laws now or hereafter in force
exempting property from liability for rent or for debt.

          Section 16.6.  Application of Funds.  Any payments received by Lessor
                         --------------------                                  
under any of the provisions of this Lease during the existence or continuance of
any Event of Default (and such payment is made to Lessor rather than Tenant due
to the existence of an Event of Default) shall be applied to Tenant's
obligations in the order which Lessor may determine or as may be prescribed by
the laws of the State where the applicable Leased Property is located.

the account and at the expense of Tenant, and may, to the extent permitted by
law, enter upon any or each Leased Property or any portion thereof for such

necessary or appropriate therefor.  No such entry shall be deemed an eviction of
Tenant.  All reasonable sums so paid by Lessor and all costs and expenses

case, to the maximum extent permitted by law) so incurred, together with
interest thereon (to the maximum extent permitted by law) at the Overdue Rate

In the event Tenant purchases any Leased Property from Lessor pursuant to any of
the terms of this Lease, Lessor shall, upon receipt from Tenant of the
applicable purchase price, together with full payment of all Rent due and
payable or other charges due and payable with respect to any period ending on or
before the date of the purchase, deliver to Tenant an appropriate deed or other
conveyance (in the customary form used to convey commercial properties within
the relevant jurisdiction) conveying the entire interest of Lessor in and to
such Leased Property to Tenant free and clear of all encumbrances other than (i)
those that Tenant has agreed hereunder to pay or discharge, (ii) those mortgage
liens, if any, which Tenant has agreed in writing to accept and to take title
subject to and (iii) Permitted Encumbrances.  The difference between the
applicable purchase price and the total of the encumbrances assumed or taken
subject to shall be paid in cash to Lessor or as Lessor may direct, in federal
or other immediately available funds except as otherwise mutually agreed by
Lessor and Tenant other than as specifically provided above, such Leased
Property shall be conveyed to Tenant on an "as is" basis, and in its then
physical condition.  Closing of any such sale shall be contingent upon and
subject to Tenant obtaining all required governmental consents and approvals for
such transfer and if such sale shall fail to be consummated by reason of the
inability of Tenant to obtain all such approvals and consents, any options to
extend the Term of this Master Lease which

such conveyance, including, without limitation, the cost of title examination or
standard coverage title insurance, if reasonably required under the
circumstances then existing, attorneys' fees incurred [by Lessor] in connection
with such conveyance and release, and transfer taxes, shall be paid by Lessor,
except that such charges shall be paid by Tenant in case of a sale pursuant to
Section 16.4. Recording fees shall be paid for by Tenant.

days but not more than three hundred sixty (360) days prior to the termination
of the then current Term.  Tenant may not exercise its option for more than one
Extended Term at a time.  During the first such Extended Term, all of the terms
and conditions of this Lease shall continue in full force and effect, except
that the Minimum Rent for and during such Extended Term shall be equal to the
Minimum Rent in effect on the last day of the Fixed Term, plus the Escalation
Amount.  During each of the second Extended Term and the third Extended Term,
all of the terms and conditions of this Lease shall continue in full force and
effect, except that the Rent for and during the Extended Terms shall be the then
current fair market rental ("Fair Market Rental") which unless otherwise

procedure pursuant to the provisions of Article XXXV.  If Tenant fails to notify
Lessor of the exercise of any extension option which Tenant has the right to
exercise hereunder prior to the required time, its option or options to extend
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect for a period of thirty (30)
days after receipt of written notice from Lessor subsequent to the required time
setting forth the expiration date of this Lease and advising Tenant that notice
of extension has not been received.

Tenant agrees to execute and deliver promptly any commercially reasonable form

has given written notice of such act or omission to each Superior Mortgagee and
each Superior Lessor whose name and address shall have previously been furnished

party at its last address so furnished, (ii) Lessor shall have failed to cure

giving of such notice, no Superior Mortgagee and no Superior Lessor shall have
remedied such act or omission (x) in the case of an act or omission which is
capable of being remedied without possession of this Leased Property, within the
cure period available to Lessor under this Lease plus sixty (60) days and (y) in

possession of the applicable Leased Property, within sixty (60) days following

provisions of this Section shall apply in respect to each the Leasehold

debt.

          (b) The term "Leasehold Mortgagee" as used in this Section shall refer
to a holder of a Leasehold Mortgage approved by Lessor pursuant to the terms
hereof. Lessor hereby approves of Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, as
collateral agent, as the initial Leasehold Mortgagee.

From and after the time such notice has been given to a Leasehold Mortgagee, the
Leasehold Mortgagee shall have the same period, after the giving of such notice
upon it, for remedying any default or acts or omissions which are the subject
matter of such notice or causing the same to be remedied, as is given Tenant
after the giving of such notice to Tenant, plus 30 days to remedy, commence
remedying or cause to be remedied the defaults or acts or omissions which are
the subject matter of such notice specified in any such notice, provided that
such defaults are capable of being cured by the Leasehold Mortgagee or on behalf
of the Leasehold Mortgagee. Lessor shall accept such performance by or at the
instigation of the Leasehold Mortgagee as if the same had been done by Tenant.
Tenant authorizes each Leasehold Mortgagee to take any such action at the
Leasehold Mortgagee's option and does hereby authorize entry upon the Leased
Properties by the Leasehold Mortgagee for such purpose. If Leasehold Mortgagee
has failed to cure Tenant's default within the above-mentioned time period,

Leasehold Mortgagee has commenced taking steps to acquire or sell Tenant's
interest in this Lease by foreclosure of the Leasehold Mortgage or other
appropriate means, the Leasehold Mortgagee shall provide Landlord notice of the
same and shall prosecute the same to completion with due diligence.

          (b)  During such period, this Lease shall not then terminate, and the
time for completion by such Leasehold Mortgagee of its proceedings shall
continue so long as such Leasehold Mortgagee is enjoined or stayed and
thereafter for so long as such Leasehold Mortgagee proceeds to complete steps to
acquire or sell Tenant's interest in this Lease by foreclosure of the Leasehold
Mortgage or by other appropriate means with reasonable diligence and continuity.
Nothing in this Section 22.5, however, shall be construed to extend this Lease
beyond the original term thereof as extended by any options to extend the term
of this Lease properly exercised by Tenant or a Leasehold Mortgagee in
accordance with Section 19.1, nor to require a Leasehold Mortgagee to continue
such foreclosure proceedings after the default has been cured.  If the default
shall be cured and the Leasehold Mortgagee shall discontinue such foreclosure
proceedings, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect as if Tenant had
not defaulted under this Lease.

pay or cause to be paid the rent, additional rent and other monetary obligations
of Tenant under this Lease as the same become due, and continue its good faith
efforts to perform, or cause to be performed, all of Tenant's other obligations
under this Lease.

                         ---------------------------------------------       
For the purposes of this Section 22.6, the making of a Leasehold Mortgage shall
not be deemed to constitute an assignment or transfer of this Lease or of the
leasehold estate hereby created, nor shall any Leasehold Mortgagee, as such, be
deemed to be an assignee or transferee of this Lease or of the leasehold estate
hereby created so as to require the Leasehold Mortgagee, as such, to assume the
performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions on the part of the
Tenant to be performed hereunder, but the purchaser at any sale of this Lease
and of the Leasehold Estate hereby created in any proceedings for the
foreclosure of any Leasehold Mortgage, or the assignee or transferee of this
Lease and of the leasehold estate hereby created under any instrument of
assignment or transfer in lieu of the foreclosure of any Leasehold Mortgage,
shall be deemed to be an assignee or transferee within the meaning of this
Section 2264, and shall be deemed to have agreed to perform all of the terms,
covenants and conditions on the part of the Tenant to be performed hereunder
from and after the date of such purchase and assignment.

          (b) Prior to any such purchase or assignment pursuant to a foreclosure
or similar proceeding, the Leasehold Mortgagee shall notify Lessor of the
proposed transferee.  Subject to any state or other governmental requirements,
Lessor shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to any sale or assignment,
provided that (a) the purchaser or assignee (1) shall be a creditworthy entity
with sufficient financial stability to satisfy its financial obligations under
the Lease, (2) shall have not less than four years experience in operating
health care facilities for the purpose of the applicable Facility's Primary
Intended Use, (3) has a favorable business and operational reputation and
character and (4) shall assume in writing and agree to keep and perform all of
the terms of this Lease on the part of Tenant to be performed hereunder from and
after the date of such purchase and assignment and (b) an original counterpart
of each such purchase and sale agreement or instrument of assignment or transfer
in lieu of foreclosure of any Leasehold Mortgage, duly executed by Tenant and
such purchaser or assignee, as the case may be, in the form and substance
satisfactory to Lessor, shall be delivered promptly to Lessor.  Lessor's
obligation to consent to a sale or assignment is subject to any reasonable
approval rights of any Facility Mortgagee and/or the lenders under that certain
Credit Agreement, dated April 30, 1998, by and among the Lessor, NationsBank,
N.A., as administrative agent, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, as
documentation agent, JP Morgan Securities Inc. and NationsBank Montgomery
Securities LLC as co-arrangers and the banks parties thereto, as the same may be
amended and/or replaced from time to time.

and conditions (including all options to renew but excluding requirements which
are not applicable or which have already been fulfilled) identical to this
Lease, provided:

          (a) The Leasehold Mortgagee shall make written request upon Lessor for
     such New Lease within sixty (60) days after the date the Leasehold
     Mortgagee receives Lessor's Notice of Termination of this Lease given
     pursuant to this Section 22.7.

          (b) The Leasehold Mortgagee or its designee shall pay or cause to be
     paid to Lessor at the time of the execution and delivery of such New Lease,
     any and all sums which would at the time of execution and delivery thereof
     be due pursuant to this Lease but for such termination and, in addition
     thereto, all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees,
     which Lessor shall have incurred by reason of such termination and the
     execution and delivery of the New Lease and which have not otherwise been
     received by Lessor from Tenant or other party in interest under Tenant.
     Upon the execution of such New Lease, Lessor shall allow to the Tenant
     named therein as an offset against the sums otherwise due under this
     Section 22.7(b) or under the New Lease, an amount equal to the net income
     derived by Lessor from the Leased Properties during the period from the
     date of termination of this Lease to the date of the beginning of the Lease
     term of such New Lease.  In the event of a controversy as to the amount to
     be paid to Lessor pursuant to this Section 22.7(b), the payment obligation
     shall be satisfied if Lessor shall be paid the amount not in controversy,
     and the Leasehold Mortgagee or its designee shall agree to pay any
     additional sum ultimately determined to be due plus interest at the Overdue
     Rate and such obligation shall be adequately secured.

          (c) The Leasehold Mortgagee or its designee shall agree to remedy any
of Tenant's defaults of which said Leasehold Mortgagee was notified by Lessor's
Notice of Termination and which are reasonably susceptible of being so cured by
Leasehold Mortgagee or its designee.

          (d) The Tenant under such New Lease shall have the same right, title

insurance provided for in Article XIII, and without regard to the policy limits
of any such insurance, Tenant will protect, indemnify, save harmless and defend
Lessor from and against all liabilities, obligations, claims, damages,
penalties, causes of action, costs and reasonable expenses (including, without
limitation, Litigation Costs), to the maximum extent permitted by law, imposed
upon or incurred by or asserted against Lessor by reason of:  (a) any accident,
injury to or death of persons or loss of or damage to property occurring on or
about any Leased Property or adjoining sidewalks, including without limitation
any claims of malpractice, (b) any use, misuse, non-use, condition, maintenance
or repair by Tenant or anyone claiming under Tenant, including agents,
contractors, invitees or visitors of any Leased Property or Tenant's Personal
Property, (c)

applicable provisions of this Lease), (d) any failure on the part of Tenant or
anyone claiming under Tenant to perform or comply with any of the terms of this
lease, and (e) the non-performance of any of the terms and provisions of any and
all existing and future subleases of any Leased Property to be performed by the
Tenant thereunder. Any amounts which become payable by Tenant under this Section
shall be paid within ten (10) days after liability therefor on the part of
Tenant is determined by litigation or otherwise, and if not timely paid, shall
bear interest (to the extent permitted by law) at the Overdue Rate from the date
of such determination to the date of payment. Tenant, at its expense, shall
contest, resist and defend any such claim, action or proceeding asserted or
instituted against Lessor or may compromise or otherwise dispose of the same as
Tenant sees fit. Nothing herein shall be construed as indemnifying Lessor
against its own negligent acts or omissions or willful misconduct. If at any
time Lessor shall have notice of a claim, Lessor shall give reasonably prompt
written notice of such claim to Tenant; provided that (i) Lessor shall have no
                                        -------- ----     
liability for a failure to give notice of any claim of which Tenant has
otherwise been notified or has knowledge and (ii) the failure of Lessor to give
such a notice to Tenant shall not limit the rights of Lessor or the obligations
of Tenant with respect to such claim except to the extent that Tenant incurs
actual expenses or suffers actual monetary loss as a result of such failure.
Tenant shall have the right to control the defense or settlement of any Claim,
provided that (A) Tenant shall first confirm in writing to the Lessor that such
claim is within the scope of this indemnity and that Tenant shall pay any and
all amounts required to be paid in respect of such claim and (B) if the
compromise or settlement of any such claim shall not result in the complete
release of Lessor from the claim so compromised or settled, the compromise or
settlement shall require the prior written approval of Lessor. Lessor shall have
the right to approve counsel engaged to defend such claim and, at its election
and sole cost and expense, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate in the defense of any claim.

          Lessor shall indemnify, save harmless and defend Tenant from and
against all liabilities, obligations, claims, damages, penalties, causes of
action, costs and expenses imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against
Tenant as a result of the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of Lessor.

          Tenant's or Lessor's liability for a breach of the provisions of this
Article arising during the Term hereof shall survive any termination of this
Lease.

withheld or delayed, assign, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, encumber or
otherwise transfer any interest in this Lease or sublease all or any part of any
Leased Property or suffer or permit this Lease or the leasehold estate created
hereby or thereby or any other rights arising under this Lease to be assigned,
transferred, mortgaged, pledged, hypothecated or encumbered, in whole or in
part, whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law, or permit the
use or occupancy of any Leased Property to be offered or advertised for
assignment or subletting except as hereinafter provided. For purposes of this
Section 25.1, an assignment of this Lease shall be deemed to include any change
in control of Tenant, as if such change in control or transaction were an
assignment of this Lease. Changes in control of Tenant shall include, without
limitation, (a) a change in the composition of the board of directors of Tenant
or a Guarantor such that at the end of any period of twelve (12) consecutive
months the persons constituting a majority of such board of directors are not
the same as the persons constituting a majority at the start of such period (or
persons appointed by such majority), (b) the sale or other disposition by a
Guarantor of (i) any part of its interest in Tenant or (ii) all or substantially
all of the assets of a Guarantor or Tenant (other than a bona fide pledge in
connection with a financing approved by Lessor), and (c) a merger or
consolidation involving a Guarantor or Tenant, which results in the stockholders
of a Guarantor or Tenant immediately prior to such event owning less than 50% of
the capital stock of the surviving entity or any public parent of the surviving
entity.

          Section 25.1.2.  Subject to the provisions of Section 25.3 below and
any other express conditions or limitations set forth herein, Tenant may,
without the consent of Lessor, (i) assign this Lease or sublet all or any part
of any Leased Property to any Affiliate of Tenant, or (ii) sublet up to an
aggregate of 20% of the rentable square footage of any Facility (a) in the
normal course of the Primary Intended Use such as but not limited to leasing of
space for major moveable equipment or functional departments such as pathology,
pharmacy and radiology, or (b) to concessionaires or other third party users or
operators of portions of the Leased Property.  Lessor shall not unreasonably
withhold its consent to any other subletting or assignment, provided that (a) in
the case of a subletting, the subtenant shall comply with the provisions of
Section 25.2, (b) in the case of an assignment, the assignee (1) shall be a
creditworthy entity with sufficient financial stability to satisfy its
obligations under the Lease, (2) shall have not less than four years experience
in operating health care facilities for the purpose of the applicable Facility's
Primary Intended Use, (3) has a favorable business and operational reputation
and character and (4) shall assume in writing and agree to keep and perform all
of the terms of this Lease on the part of Tenant to be kept and performed and
shall be, and become, jointly and severally liable with Tenant for the
performance thereof, (c) an original counterpart of each such sublease and
assignment and assumption, duly executed by Tenant and such subtenant or
assignee, as the case may be, in the form and substance satisfactory to Lessor,
shall be delivered promptly to Lessor, and (d) in case of either an assignment
or subletting, Tenant shall remain primarily liable, as principal rather than as

                                       53

surety, for the prompt payment of the Rent and for the performance and
observance of all of the covenants and conditions to be performed by Tenant
hereunder.  Lessor's obligation to consent to a subletting or assignment is
subject to any reasonable approval rights of any Facility Mortgagee and/or the
lenders under that certain Credit Agreement, dated April 30, 1998, by and among
the Lessor, NationsBank, N.A., as administrative agent, Morgan Guaranty Trust
Company of New York, as documentation agent, JP Morgan Securities Inc. and
NationsBank Montgomery Securities LLC as co-arrangers and the banks parties
thereto, as the same may be amended and/ or replaced from time to time..

          Section 25.1.3.  If this Lease is assigned or if any Leased Property
or any part thereof is sublet (or occupied by any entity other than Tenant and
its employees), Lessor, after an Event of Default occurs and so long as it is
continuing, may collect the rents from such assignee, subtenant or occupant, as
the case may be, and apply the net amount collected to the Rent herein reserved,
but no such collection shall be deemed a waiver of the provisions set forth in
Section 25.1.1, the acceptance by Lessor of such assignee, subtenant or
occupant, as the case may be, as a tenant or release of Tenant from the future
performance of its covenants, agreements or obligations contained in this Lease.

          Section 25.1.4.  No subletting or assignment shall in any way impair
the continuing primary liability of Tenant hereunder, and no consent to any
subletting or assignment in an particular instance shall be deemed a waiver of
the prohibition set forth in this Section 25.1.  No assignment, subletting or
occupancy shall affect the Primary Intended Use.  Any subletting, assignment or
other transfer of Tenant's interest in this Lease in contravention of this
Section 25.1 shall be void at Lessor's option.

          Section 25.1.5.  If Tenant shall desire to assign this Lease or sublet
all (but not a portion) of any Leased Property other than an assignment or
sublease to an Affiliate, it shall first submit in writing to Lessor a notice
("Tenant's Notice") indicating (a) the name of the proposed assignee or
- - -----------------                                                      
subtenant, (b) the material terms of the proposed assignment or sublease, (c)
the nature and character of the business which the proposed assignee or
subtenant will conduct at the applicable Leased Property, (d) reasonable
financial data concerning the proposed assignee or subtenant, and (e) the
effective date of the proposed assignment or the commencement date and
expiration date of the proposed sublease.  Tenant shall additionally submit to
Lessor any other information concerning the proposed sublease which Lessor may
reasonably request.  If such notice is given, Lessor may, at its option
terminate this Lease in the case of an assignment or terminate this Lease as to
the applicable Leased Property in the case of a sublease.  Lessor shall exercise
its option by notice to Tenant within 30 days after Tenant's Notice (or receipt
by Lessor of all information reasonably requested by Lessor pursuant to this
Section 21.1.5), 

                                       54

and during such 30-day period, Tenant shall not have the right to assign this
Lease or sublet such space.

          Section 25.1.6.  If Lessor exercises its option under Section 21.1.5
to terminate this Lease, this Lease shall terminate (either as to each Leased
Property or as to the applicable Leased Property, whichever is applicable) on
the date which is 60 days following Tenant's Notice or on such later date as may
be specified in Tenant's Notice, and all Rent shall be paid and apportioned to
the date of such termination.  If Lessor shall exercise its options under
Section 21.1.5, Lessor may, and shall have no liability to Tenant if Lessor
shall, lease to Tenant's prospective subtenant or assignee.

          Section 25.1.7.  If Lessor shall give its consent to any assignment or
subletting, Tenant shall, in consideration therefor, pay to Lessor, as
Additional Charges as and when payable to Tenant, 20% of any consideration
received on account of the assignment and (ii) 20% of the excess of (x) any
rents, additional charges, or other consideration payable under the sublease by
the subtenant to Tenant, after deducting therefrom brokerage commissions, legal
fees incurred in connection with such subletting over (y) Rent accruing during
                                                 ----     
the term of the sublease pursuant to the terms hereof (such excess, the
"Sublease Profits").

          Section 25.1.8.  Any assignment and/or sublease must provide that (a)
it shall be subject and subordinate to all of the terms and conditions of this
Lease, (b) the use of the applicable Leased Property shall be restricted to the
applicable Primary Intended Use and shall not conflict with any Legal
Requirement, Insurance Requirement or any other provision of this Lease, (c) no
sublessee or assignee shall be permitted to further sublet all or any part of
the applicable Leased Property or assign this Lease or its sublease except as
expressly provided in this Lease and (d) in the event of cancellation or
termination of this Lease for any reason whatsoever or of the surrender of this
Lease whether voluntary, involuntary or by operation of law, prior to the
expiration date of such sublease, including extensions and renewals granted
thereunder, at Lessor's option, the subtenant shall make full and complete
attornment to Lessor for the balance of the term of the sublease, which
attornment shall be evidenced by an agreement in form and substance satisfactory
to Lessor and which the subtenant shall execute and deliver within 5 days after
request by Lessor, its successors or assigns and the subtenant shall waive the
provisions of any law now or hereafter in effect which may give the subtenant
any right of election to terminate the sublease or to surrender possession in
the event any proceeding is brought by Lessor to terminate this Lease.
 
          Section 25.1.9.  Any assignment of this Lease or sublease of the
applicable Leased Property in contravention of the express terms of this Article

from any such

unauthorized assignee or subtenant shall not constitute a recognition or
acceptance of the tenancy of such unauthorized assignee or subtenant.

Lessor's option, attorn to Lessor and waive any right the subtenant may have to
terminate the sublease or to surrender possession thereunder, as a result of the
termination of this Lease, and (c) in the event the subtenant receives a written
notice from Lessor or Lessor's assignees, if any, stating that Tenant is in
Default under this Lease, the subtenant shall thereafter be obligated to pay all
rentals accruing under said sublease directly to the party giving such notice,
or as such party may direct. All rentals received from the subtenant by Lessor
or Lessor's assignees, if any, as the case may be, shall be credited against the
amounts owing by Tenant under this Lease.

to the contrary notwithstanding, Tenant shall not sublet the Leased Property on
any basis such that the rental to be paid by the subtenant thereunder would be
based, in whole or in part, on either (i) the income or profits derived by the
business activities of the subtenant, or (ii) any other formula such that any
portion of the sublease rental received by Lessor would fail to qualify as
"rents from real property" within the meaning of Section 856(d) of the Code, or
any similar or successor provision thereto.

has been paid, that Tenant is not in default in the performance or observance of
any of the terms of this Lease and that no event exists which with the giving of

determine the Fair Market Value, Fair Market Value Purchase Price or Fair Market
Rental of any property for any purpose of this Lease, and the parties cannot
agree amongst themselves on such value, the party required or permitted to give
notice of such required determination shall include in the notice the name of a
person selected to act as appraiser on its behalf. Within 10 days after receipt
of any such notice, Lessor (or Tenant, as the case may be) shall by notice to
Tenant (or Lessor, as the case may be) appoint a second person as appraiser on
its behalf. The appraisers thus appointed, each of whom must be a member of the
American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers (or any successor organization
thereto), shall, within 45 days after the date of the notice appointing the
first appraiser, proceed to appraise the applicable Leased Property to determine
the Fair Market Value, Fair Market Value Purchase Price, Fair Market Rental,
thereof as of the relevant date (giving effect to the impact, if any, of
inflation from the date of their decision to the relevant date); provided,

appraisers shall have been so appointed but only one such appraiser shall have
made such determination within 50 days after the making of Tenant's or Lessor's
request, then the determination of such appraiser shall be final and binding
upon the parties. To the extent consistent with sound appraisal practice as then
existing at the time of any such appraisal, such appraisal shall be made on a
basis consistent with the basis on which the applicable Leased Property was
appraised for 

                                       60

purposes of determining its Fair Market Value at the time such Leased Property
was acquired by Lessor, which basis is described on Exhibit F annexed hereto. 
                                                    ---------
If two appraisers shall have been appointed and shall have made their
determinations within the respective requisite periods set forth above and if
the difference between the amounts so determined shall not exceed ten percent
(10%) of the lesser of such amounts, then the Fair Market Value, Fair Market
Value Purchase Price or Fair Market Rental shall be an amount equal to 50% of
the sum of the amounts so determined. If the difference between the amounts so
determined shall exceed ten percent (10%) of the lesser of such amounts, then
such two appraisers shall have 20 days to appoint a third appraiser, but if such
appraisers fail to do so, then either party may request the American Arbitration
Association or any successor organization thereto to appoint an appraiser within
20 days of such request, and both parties shall be bound by any appointment so
made within such 20 day period. If no such appraiser shall have been appointed
within such 20 days or within 90 days of the original request for a
determination of Fair Market Value, Fair Market Value Purchase Price or Fair
Market Rental, whichever is earlier, either Lessor or Tenant may apply to any
court having jurisdiction to have such appointment made by such court. Any
appraiser appointed by the original appraisers, by the American Arbitration
Association or by such court shall be instructed to determine the Fair Market
Value, Fair Market Value Purchase Price or Fair Market Rental within 30 days
after appointment of such Appraiser. The determination of the appraiser which
differs most in terms of dollar amount from the determination of the other two
appraisers shall be excluded, and 50% of the sum of the remaining two
determinations shall be final and binding upon Lessor and Tenant as the Fair
Market Value, Fair Market Value Purchase Price or Fair Market Rental for such
interest. This provision for determination by appraisal shall be specifically
enforceable to the extent such remedy is available under applicable law, and any
determination hereunder shall be final and binding upon the parties except as
otherwise provided by applicable law. Lessor and Tenant shall each pay the fees
and expenses of the appraiser appointed by it and each shall pay one-half of the
fees and expenses of the third appraiser and one-half of all other cost and
expenses incurred in connection with each appraisal.

          Section 36.1.1.  Tenant understands that, in order for Lessor to
qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"), the following requirements
                                            ----                              
(the "REIT Requirements") must be satisfied:

               (i) The average of the adjusted tax bases of Lessor's personal
     property that is leased to Tenant  under a lease at the beginning and end
     of a calendar year cannot exceed 15% of the average of the aggregate
     adjusted tax

     bases of all of Lessor's property that is leased to Tenant under such lease
     at the beginning and end of such calendar year.

               (ii) Tenant cannot sublet the property that is leased to it by
     Lessor, or enter into any similar arrangement, on any basis such that the
     rental or other amounts paid by the sublessee thereunder would be based, in
     whole or in part, on either (i) the net income or profits derived by the
     business activities of the sublessee or (ii) any other formula such that
     any portion of the rent paid by Tenant to Lessor would fail to qualify as
     "rents from real property" within the meaning of Section 856(d) of the
     Code.

               (iii)  Tenant cannot sublease the property leased to it by Lessor
     to, or enter into any similar arrangement with, any person in which Lessor
     owns, directly or indirectly, a 10% or more interest, within the meaning of
     Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code.

               (iv) Lessor cannot own, directly or indirectly, a 10% or more
     interest in Tenant, within the meaning of Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code.

          Section 36.1.2.  Tenant agrees, and agrees to use reasonable efforts
to cause its Affiliates, to use their best efforts to permit the REIT
Requirements to be satisfied.  Tenant agrees and agrees to use reasonable
efforts to cause its Affiliates, to cooperate in good faith with Lessor or to
ensure that the REIT Requirements are satisfied, including but not limited to,
providing Lessor with information about the ownership of Tenant, and its
Affiliates to the extent that such information is reasonably available. Tenant
agrees, and agrees to use reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates, upon
request by to take reasonable action necessary to ensure compliance with the
REIT Requirements. Immediately after becoming aware that the REIT Requirements
are not, or will not be, satisfied, Tenant shall notify, or use reasonable
efforts to cause its Affiliates to notify Lessor of such noncompliance.

Property which Lessor intends to accept (or has accepted subject to Tenant's

Leased Property for sale, Lessor shall promptly notify Tenant of the purchase
price and all other material terms and conditions of such agreement or proposed
sale and

Tenant shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice from Lessor
within which time to exercise Tenant's option to purchase. If Tenant exercises
its option, then such transaction shall be consummated within sixty (60) days

with the terms and conditions of such agreement, as to price and the other
conditions set forth therein and in accordance with the provisions of Article
XVIII hereof to the extent not inconsistent therewith, on the first day of the
first month after all permits for owning or operating the Facility on the Leased
Property have been obtained by Tenant, but in no event later than 120 days after
the date of receipt by Lessor of notice of the exercise by Tenant of this
option. If Tenant shall not exercise Tenant's option to purchase within said
thirty (30) day period after receipt of said notice from Lessor, Lessor shall be
free for a period of one year after the expiration of said 30 day period to sell
the applicable Leased Property to any third party at a price and upon terms no
less favorable to Lessor than those so offered to Tenant. Whether or not such
sale is consummated, Tenant shall be entitled to exercise its right of first
refusal as provided in this section, as to any subsequent sale of the applicable
Leased Property during the first three (3) years of the Term of this Lease. The
provisions of this Section 37.1 shall not apply to any transaction involving (i)

          Section 40.1.  _________.  Anything contained in this Lease to the
contrary notwithstanding, all claims against, and liabilities of, the Tenant or
Lessor arising prior to any date of termination of this Lease shall survive such
termination.  If any term or provision of this Lease or any application hereof
shall be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Lease and any other
application of such term or provision shall not be affected thereby.  If any
late charges provided for in any provision of this Lease are based upon a rate
in excess of the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, the parties agree
that such charges shall be fixed at the maximum permissible rate. Neither this
Lease nor any provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated
except by an instrument in writing and in recordable form signed by Lessor and
Tenant.  All the terms and provisions of this Lease shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.  The headings in this Lease are for convenience of reference only and
shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

to Lessor's assets for recovery of any judgment from Lessor, it being
specifically agreed that no constituent partner in Lessor, shall ever be
personally liable for any such judgment or for the payment of any monetary
obligation to Tenant. The provision contained in the foregoing sentence is not
intended to, and shall not, limit any right that Tenant might otherwise have to
obtain injunctive relief against Lessor or Lessor's successors in interest, or
any action not involving the personal liability of Lessor (original or
successor).

event shall Lessor (original or successor) ever be liable to Tenant for any
indirect or consequential damages suffered by Tenant from whatever cause.

Lessor or Lessor's nominee unless such termination results from an Event of

raw materials, accident, unusually sever weather or other cause similar to the

                                                     -------------

          (b) If the performance of this Agreement by either party or any
obligation hereunder is prevented, restricted or interfered with by reason of a
Force Majeure event, the party whose performance is so affected, upon giving
prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the
extent of such Force Majeure event; provided, however, that the party so
                                    --------  -------

shall have no liability hereunder resulting from failure of or a delay in
completion of development of a Project; provided, however, that Healthcare
                                        --------  -------
Company shall not be permitted to delay or cancel a Project if the reason for
such delay or cancellation is the purchase or development of another facility by
Healthcare Company in the same market, in which event Vencor shall have the
option to purchase such substitute facility at Healthcare Company's cost. If
Vencor exercises such option to purchase a substitute facility, it shall lease
such facility to Healthcare Company in accordance with Section 3.3 hereof.

          Section 8.3 Contractors.  Neither Healthcare Company, any of its 
                      -----------                
affiliates nor any of their respective present or former directors, officers, 
partners,

                                      -7-
<PAGE>
 
employees or agents shall have any liability to Vencor or any person asserting
claims on behalf of or in right of Vencor in connection with or as a result of
any obligation of Healthcare Company under this Agreement except to the extent
that any Losses (as defined herein) incurred by Vencor result from the bad
faith, gross negligence or wilful misconduct of Healthcare Company in performing
its obligations under this Agreement.  Healthcare Company shall not have any
liability for any failure of performance or refusal to perform by a Contractor,
and Healthcare Company shall not have any liability for any defects in the work
performed by a Contractor; provided, that Healthcare Company was not grossly
                           --------                                         
negligent or acting in bad faith in selecting such Contractor or in monitoring
the performance of such Contractor.

      Section 9.    Indemnification.
                    --------------- 

              (a)   Healthcare Company hereby agrees that it shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Vencor, its affiliates, and, if applicable, their
respective present and former directors, officers, partners, employees and
agents (collectively, the "Vencor Indemnified Parties") from, against and in
                           --------------------------
respect of, any damages, claims, losses, actions, suits, proceedings,
liabilities, and reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's
fees and expenses of investigation) (collectively, "Losses") directly relating
                                                    -----
to or arising from the bad faith, gross negligence or wilful misconduct of
Healthcare Company in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

          (b) Vencor shall give prompt notice to Healthcare Company of a claim
under this Section 7, and shall provide to Healthcare Company as soon as
practicable thereafter all information and documentation necessary to support
and verify, any Losses that the Vencor Indemnified Parties shall have determined
to have given or give rise to a claim for indemnification under this Section 7.
Failure by Vencor to give prompt notice of a claim under this Section 7 shall
affect the rights of Vencor hereunder only to the extent that such failure has a
prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to Healthcare
Company with respect to such claim.  Vencor shall have a right to consult in the
defense of a claim and to employ counsel, at Vencor's expense, separate from the
counsel employed by Healthcare Company to the extent such claim involves
potential conflicts of interest between or different defenses for Healthcare
Company and Vencor and Vencor reasonably determines that separate representation
would be appropriate.

supplement, discharge or waiver hereof or hereunder shall require the consent of
any person not a party to this Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the mutual covenants and undertakings
contained herein, and subject to and on the terms and conditions herein set

     Section 1.     Vencor's Purchase Right of First Offer.  (a) Vencor and any
                    --------------------------------------                     
Vencor subsidiary (including partnerships in which Vencor holds a majority
interest)  (together with Vencor, the "Vencor Entities", and each, a "Vencor
                                       ---------------                ------
Entity") shall have a right of first offer (a "Purchase Right of First Offer")
- - ------                                         -----------------------------  
to purchase any healthcare related real property  (a "Sale Property") currently
                                                      -------------            
owned by Healthcare Company or its consolidated subsidiaries (together with
Healthcare Company, the "Healthcare Company Entities", and each, a "Healthcare
                         ---------------------------                ----------
Company Entity") (other than the Development Properties) or acquired by a
- - --------------                                                           
Healthcare Company Entity in the future when such Healthcare Company Entity
determines to sell the Sale Property to a third party subject to the terms and
conditions hereof.  If a Healthcare Company Entity determines to sell a Sale
Property, it must provide written notice (the "Sale Opportunity Notice") to the
                                               -----------------------         
Vencor Entities of the purchase opportunity.  A Vencor Entity shall exercise its
Purchase Right of First Offer, if at all, by sending written notice (the "Sale
                                                                          ----
Acceptance Notice") to the Healthcare Company Entity within thirty (30) days
- - -----------------                                                           
following such Vencor Entity's receipt of the Sale Opportunity Notice.  Upon the
Healthcare Company Entity's receipt of the Sale Acceptance Notice, the
Healthcare Company Entity and the Vencor Entity shall commence negotiating in
good faith, on an exclusive basis regarding the terms and conditions of such
purchase.  During such negotiation period, the Healthcare Company Entity shall
permit the Vencor Entity to inspect the Sale Property and the books and records
relating to the Sale Property upon reasonable advance notice and during
reasonable business hours.  If the Parties fail to reach a mutually satisfactory
agreement as to the terms for such purchase within the 30-day period (or such
longer period as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties) the Vencor Entity's
Purchase Right of First Offer shall be deemed to extinguish.  Thereafter, the
Healthcare Company Entity may offer the Sale Property to third parties and is
free to negotiate with such third parties for a period of one hundred eighty
(180) days with no further obligations hereunder; provided, however, that no
                                                  --------  -------         
Healthcare Company Entity may sell a Sale Property to a third party for less
than the Vencor Entity's final offer for such property without such Vencor
Entity first being given an opportunity to match such third party offer.  The
Vencor Entity's  Purchase Right of First Offer shall revive in the event that
the Healthcare Company Entity fails to sell or otherwise transfer the Sale
Property to a third party within said 180-day period.  If

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
 
a Vencor Entity elects to exercise its Purchase Right of First Offer, it shall
in all events have not less than thirty (30) days to close its acquisition of
the Sale Property.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Purchase Right of First Offer
shall not be applicable to any property for which a Healthcare Company Entity
determines to (i) retain ownership or (ii) sell the operations of the facility
related to the real property.

     Section 2.     Vencor's Mortgage Right of First Offer.  (a) The Vencor
                    --------------------------------------                 
Entities shall have a right of first offer (a "Mortgage Right of First Offer")
                                               -----------------------------  
to finance any healthcare related real property  (a "Mortgage Property")
                                                     -----------------  
currently owned by a Healthcare Company Entity (other than the Development
Properties) or acquired by a Healthcare Company Entity in the future when such
Healthcare Company Entity determines to mortgage the Mortgage Property to a
third party subject to the terms and conditions hereof.  If a Healthcare Company
Entity determines to mortgage a Mortgage Property, it must provide written
notice (the "Mortgage Opportunity Notice") to the Vencor Entities of the
             ---------------------------                                
mortgage opportunity.  A Vencor Entity shall exercise its Mortgage Right of
First Offer, if at all, by sending written notice (the "Mortgage Acceptance

Healthcare Company Entity's receipt of the Mortgage Acceptance Notice, the
Healthcare Company Entity and the Vencor Entity shall commence negotiating in
good faith, on an exclusive basis regarding the terms and conditions of such
mortgage financing.  During such negotiation period, the Healthcare Company
Entity shall permit the Vencor Entity to inspect the Mortgage Property and the
books and records relating to the Mortgage Property upon reasonable advance
notice and during reasonable business hours.  If the Parties fail to reach a
mutually satisfactory agreement as to the terms for such mortgage within the 30-
day period (or such longer period as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties)
the Mortgage Right of First Offer shall be deemed to extinguish.  Thereafter,
the Healthcare Company Entity may offer the Mortgage Property to third parties
and is free to negotiate with such third parties for a period of one hundred
eighty (180) days with no further obligations hereunder; provided, however, that
                                                         --------  -------      
no Healthcare Company Entity may mortgage a Mortgage Property to a third party
for an interest rate higher than the Vencor Entity's final offer for such
property without the Vencor Entity first being given an opportunity to match
such third party interest rate.  The Vencor Entities'  Mortgage Right of First
Offer shall revive in the event that the Healthcare Company Entity fails obtain
a financing commitment for the Mortgage Property from a third party within said
180-day period.  If a Vencor Entity elects to 

                                      -3-

exercise its Mortgage Right of First Offer, it shall in all events have not less
than thirty (30) days to close its financing of the Mortgage Property.

     (b)  If the Healthcare Company Entities determine to mortgage a number of
Mortgage Properties as a group (a "Mortgage Group"), and a Vencor Entity elects
                                   --------------                              
to exercise its Mortgage Right of First Offer with respect to such Mortgage
Group, the Vencor Entity must finance all of the Mortgage Properties in the
Mortgage Group.

of the Healthcare Company Entities shall have a right of first offer ("Lease

Property, it must provide written notice (the "Lease Opportunity Notice") to

commence negotiating in good faith, on an exclusive basis with such Healthcare
Company Entity regarding the terms and conditions of such lease.  During such
negotiation period, the Vencor Entity shall permit the Healthcare Company Entity
to inspect the Lease Property and the books and records relating to the Lease

If the Parties fail to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement as to the terms
for such lease within thirty (30) days following the Vencor Entity's receipt of
the Lease Opportunity Notice (or such longer period as may be mutually agreed
upon by the Parties), the Lease Right of First Offer shall be deemed to
extinguish.  Thereafter, the Vencor Entity may offer the Lease Property to third
parties and is free to negotiate with such third parties for a period of one
hundred eighty (180) days with no further obligations hereunder.  The Healthcare
Company Entities' Lease Right of First Offer shall revive in the event that the
Vencor Entity fails to lease the Lease Property to a third party within said
180-day period; provided, however, that the Vencor Entity may not lease a Lease
                --------  -------                                              
Property to a third party for less than the Healthcare Company Entity's final
offer for such property without such Healthcare Company Entity first being given
an opportunity to match such third party offer.  If a Healthcare Company Entity
elects to exercise its Lease Right of First Offer, it shall in all events have
not less than thirty (30) days to finalize the terms of its lease of the Lease
Property.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Lease Right of First Offer
shall not be applicable to any property which is being operated by a third party
on the date of acquisition or completion of development.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
                              --------------------



          This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT is made as of the 13th day of January, 1999
(the "Effective Date"), by and between Ventas, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), and JOHN C. THOMPSON (the "Executive").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:
                              - - - - - - - - - - 

          WHEREAS, the Executive is employed by the Company and the parties
hereto desire to provide for Executive's continued employment by the Company;
and

          WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") have
determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to enter into this
Agreement.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the respective
covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the Company and Executive agree as follows:

          1.  Employment.  The Company hereby agrees to employ Executive and
              ----------                                                    
Executive hereby agrees to be employed by the Company on the terms and
conditions herein set forth.  The initial term of this Agreement shall be for a
one-year period commencing on the Effective Date.  The Term shall be
automatically extended by one additional day for each day beyond the Effective
Date that the Executive remains employed by the Company until such time as the
Company elects to cease such extension by giving written notice of such election
to the Executive.  In such event, the Agreement shall terminate on the first
anniversary of the effective date of such election notice.

          2.  Duties.  Executive is engaged by the Company in an executive
              ------                                                      
capacity.

          3.  Extent of Services.  Executive, subject to the direction and
              ------------------                                          
control of the Board, shall have the power and authority commensurate with his
executive status and necessary to perform his duties hereunder.  During the
term, Executive shall devote his entire working time, attention, labor, skill
and energies to the business of the Company, and shall not, without the consent
of the Company, be actively engaged in any other business activity, whether or
not such business activity is pursued for gain, profit or other pecuniary
advantage.

          4.  Compensation.  As compensation for services hereunder rendered,
              ------------                                                   
Executive shall receive during the Term:

          (a) A base salary ("Base Salary") of not less than $100,000 per year
     payable in equal installments in accordance with the Company's normal
     payroll procedures.  Executive may receive increases in his Base Salary
     from time to time, as approved by the Board.

          (b) In addition to Base Salary, Executive may be eligible to receive
     such other bonuses or incentive compensation as the Board may approve from
     time to time.

          5.  Benefits.
              -------- 

          (a) Executive shall be entitled to participate in any and all
     Executive pension benefit, welfare benefit (including, without limitation,
     medical, dental, disability and group life insurance coverages) and fringe
     benefit plans from time to time in effect for 

<PAGE>
 
     Executives of the Company and its affiliates. 

          (b) Executive shall be entitled to participate in such bonus, stock
     option, or other incentive compensation plans of the Company and its
     affiliates in effect from time to time for executives of the Company.

          (c) Executive shall be entitled to four weeks of paid vacation each
     year.  The Executive shall schedule the timing of such vacation in a
     reasonable manner.  The Executive may also be entitled to such other leave,
     with or without compensation, as shall be mutually agreed by the Company
     and Executive.

          (d) Executive may incur reasonable expenses for promoting the
     Company's business, including expenses for entertainment, travel and
     similar items.  The Company shall reimburse Executive for all such
     reasonable expenses in accordance with the Company's reimbursement policies
     and procedures.

          6.  Termination of Employment.
              ------------------------- 

          (a) Death or Disability.  Executive's employment shall terminate
              -------------------                                         
     automatically upon Executive's death during the Term.  If the Company
     determines in good faith that the Disability of Executive has occurred
     during the Term (pursuant to the definition of Disability set forth below),
     it may give to Executive written notice of its intention to terminate
     Executive's employment.  In such event, Executive's employment with the
     Company shall terminate effective on the 30th day after receipt of such
     notice by Executive (the "Disability Effective Date"), provided that,
     within the 30 days after such receipt, Executive shall not have returned to
     full-time performance of Executive's duties. For purposes of this
     Agreement, "Disability" shall mean Executive's absence from his full-time
     duties hereunder for a period of 90 days.

          (b) Cause.  The Company may terminate Executive's employment during
              -----                                                          
     the Term for Cause.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean the
     Executive's (i) conviction of or plea of nolo contendere to a crime
                                              ---- ----------           
     involving moral turpitude; or (ii) willful and material breach by Executive
     of his duties and responsibilities, which is committed in bad faith or
     without reasonable belief that such breaching conduct is in the best
     interests of the Company and its affiliates, but with respect to (ii) only
     if the Board adopts a resolution by a vote of at least 75% of its members
     so finding after giving the Executive and his attorney an opportunity to be
     heard by the Board.  Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given
     pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or based upon advice of
     counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or
     omitted to be done, by Executive in good faith and in the best interests of
     the Company.

          (c) Good Reason. Executive's employment may be terminated by Executive
              -----------                                                       
     for Good Reason.  "Good Reason" shall exist upon the occurrence, without
     Executive's express written consent, of any of the following events:

               (i) the Company shall assign to Executive duties of a
          substantially nonexecutive or nonmanagerial nature;

                                       2
<PAGE>
 
               (ii) an adverse change in Executive's status or position as an
          executive officer of the Company, including, without limitation, an
          adverse change in Executive's status or position as a result of a
          diminution in Executive's duties and responsibilities (other than any
          such change directly attributable to the fact that the Company is no
          longer publicly owned);

               (iii)  the Company shall (A) materially reduce the Base Salary or
          bonus opportunity of Executive, or (B) materially reduce his benefits
          and perquisites (other than pursuant to a uniform reduction applicable
          to all similarly situated executives of the Company);

               (iv) the Company shall require Executive to relocate Executive's
          principal business office more than 30 miles from its location on the
          Effective Date; or

               (v) the failure of the Company to obtain the assumption of this
          Agreement as contemplated by Section 11(c).

     For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall not exist until after
     Executive has given the Company notice of the applicable event within 90
     days of such event and which is not remedied within 30 days after receipt
     of written notice from Executive specifically delineating such claimed
     event and setting forth Executive's intention to terminate employment if
     not remedied; provided that if the specified event cannot reasonably be
                   --------                                                 
     remedied within such 30-day period and the Company commences reasonable
     steps within such 30-day period to remedy such event and diligently
     continues such steps thereafter until a remedy is effected, such event
     shall not constitute "Good Reason" provided that such event is remedied
     within 60 days after receipt of such written notice.

          (d) Notice of Termination.  Any termination by the Company for Cause,
              ---------------------                                            
     or by Executive for Good Reason, shall be communicated by Notice of
     Termination given in accordance with this Agreement.  For purposes of this
     Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i)
     indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon,
     (ii) sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to
     provide a basis for termination of Executive's employment under the
     provision so indicated and (iii) specifies the intended termination date
     (which date, in the case of a termination for Good Reason, shall be not
     more than thirty days after the giving of such notice).  The failure by
     Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact
     or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause
     shall not waive any right of Executive or the Company, respectively,
     hereunder or preclude Executive or the Company, respectively, from
     asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing Executive's or the
     Company's rights hereunder.

          (e) Date of Termination.  "Date of Termination" means (i) if
              -------------------                                     
     Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, or by
     Executive for Good Reason, the later of the date specified in the Notice of
     Termination or the date that is one day after the last day of any
     applicable cure period, (ii) if Executive's employment is terminated by the
     Company other than for Cause or Disability, or Executive resigns without
     Good 

                                       3
<PAGE>
 
     Reason, the Date of Termination shall be the date on which the Company or
     Executive notified Executive or the Company, respectively, of such
     termination, and (iii) if Executive's employment is terminated by reason of
     death or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date of death of
     Executive or the Disability Effective Date, as the case may be.

          7.  Obligations of the Company Upon Termination.  Following any
              -------------------------------------------                
termination of Executive's employment hereunder, the Company shall pay Executive
his Base Salary through the Date of Termination and any amounts owed to
Executive pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Executive benefit plans
and programs of the Company at the time such payments are due.  In addition,
subject to Executive's execution of a general release of claims in form
satisfactory to the Company, Executive shall be entitled to the following
additional payments:

          (a) Death or Disability.  If, during the Term, Executive's employment
              -------------------                                              
     shall terminate by reason of Executive's death or Disability, the Company
     shall pay to Executive (or his designated beneficiary or estate, as the
     case may be) the prorated portion of any Target Bonus (as defined below)
     Executive would have received for the year of termination of employment.
     Such amount shall be paid within 30 days of the date when such amounts
     would otherwise have been payable to the Executive if Executive's
     employment had not terminated.

          (b) Good Reason; Other than for Cause.  If, during the Term, the
              ---------------------------------                           
     Company shall terminate Executive's employment other than for Cause (but
     not for Disability), or the Executive shall terminate his employment for
     Good Reason:

               (1) Within fourteen (14) days of Executive's Date of Termination,
          the Company shall pay to Executive (i) the prorated portion of the
          Target Bonus for Executive for the year in which the Date of
          Termination occurs, plus (ii) an amount equal to the Executive's Base
          Salary and Target Bonus as of the Date of Termination.

               For purposes of this Agreement: "Target Bonus" shall mean the
          full amount of bonuses and/or performance compensation (other than
          Base Salary and awards under the Company's 1997 Incentive Compensation
          Plan) that would be payable to the Executive, assuming all performance
          criteria on which such bonus and/or performance compensation are based
          were deemed to be satisfied, in respect of services for the calendar
          year in which the date in question occurs.

               (2) For a period of one year following the Date of Termination,
          the Executive shall be treated as if he or she had continued to be an
          Executive for all purposes under the Company's Health Insurance Plan
          and Dental Insurance Plan; or if the Company has not yet established
          its own Health Insurance Plan and/or Dental Plan or the Executive is
          prohibited from participating in such plan, the Company shall, at its
          sole cost and expense, provide health and dental insurance coverage
          for Executive which is equivalent to the coverage provided to
          Executive as of the Date of Termination.  Following this continuation
          period, the Executive shall be entitled to receive continuation
          coverage under Part 6 of Title I or ERISA 

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
          ("COBRA Benefits") treating the end of this period as a termination of
          the Executive's employment if allowed by law.

               (3) For a period of one year following the Date of Termination,
          Company shall maintain in force, at its expense, the Executive's life
          insurance being provided by the Company as of the Date of Termination.

               (4) For a period of one year following the Executive's Date of
          Termination, the Company shall provide short-term and long-term
          disability insurance benefits to Executive equivalent to the coverage
          that the Executive would have had he remained employed under the
          disability insurance plans applicable to Executive on the Date of
          Termination.  Should Executive become disabled during such period,
          Executive shall be entitled to receive such benefits, and for such
          duration, as the applicable plan provides.

               (5) To the extent not already vested pursuant to the terms of
          such plan, the Executive's interests under the Vencor, Inc. Retirement
          Savings Plan and any 401(k), retirement savings plan or profit sharing
          plan of the Company shall be automatically fully (i.e., 100%) vested,
          without regard to otherwise applicable percentages for the vesting of
          employer matching contributions based upon the Executive's years of
          service with the Company.

               (6) The Company shall adopt such amendments to its Executive
          benefit plans, if any, as are necessary to effectuate the provisions
          of this Agreement.

               (7) Executive shall be credited with an additional one year of
          vesting for purposes of all restricted stock awards and Executive will
          have an additional one year in which to exercise all outstanding stock
          option awards.

          (c) Cause; Other than for Good Reason.  If Executive's employment
              ---------------------------------                            
     shall be terminated for Cause or Executive terminates employment without
     Good Reason (and other than due to such Executive's death) during the Term,
     this Agreement shall terminate without further additional obligations to
     Executive under this Agreement.

          (d) Death after Termination.  In the event of the death of Executive
              -----------------------                                         
     during the period Executive is receiving payments pursuant to this
     Agreement, Executive's designated beneficiary shall be entitled to receive
     the balance of the payments; or in the event of no designated beneficiary,
     the remaining payments shall be made to Executive's estate.

          8.  Disputes.  Any dispute or controversy arising under, out of, or in
              --------                                                          
connection with this Agreement shall, at the election and upon written demand of
either party, be finally determined and settled by binding arbitration in the
City of Louisville, Kentucky, in accordance with the Labor Arbitration rules and
procedures of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment upon the award
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The Company shall pay
all costs of the arbitration and all reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees
of the Executive in connection therewith, including any litigation to enforce
any arbitration award.

          9.  Successors.
              ---------- 

          (a) This Agreement is personal to Executive and without the prior
     written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by Executive
     otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  This
     Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive's
     legal representatives.

          (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon
     the Company and its successors and assigns.

          (c) The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or
     indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
     substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, or any
     business of the Company for which Executive's services are principally
     performed, to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the
     same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to
     perform it if no such succession had taken place.  As used in this
     Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as herein before defined and
     any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and
     agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise.

          10.  Other Severance Benefits.  Executive hereby agrees that in
               ------------------------                                  
consideration for the payments to be received under this Agreement, Executive
waives any and all rights to any payments or benefits under any plans, programs,
contracts or arrangements of the Company or their respective affiliates that
provide for severance payments or benefits upon a termination of employment,
other than the Change in Control Severance Agreement between the Company and
Executive (the "Severance Agreement"); provided that any payments payable to
                                       --------                             
Executive hereunder shall be offset by any payments payable under the Severance
Agreement.

          11.  Withholding.  All payments to be made to Executive hereunder will
               -----------                                                      
be subject to all applicable required withholding of taxes.

          12.  No Mitigation.  Executive shall have no duty to mitigate his
               -------------                                               
damages by seeking other employment and, should Executive actually receive
compensation from any such other employment, the payments required hereunder
shall not be reduced or offset by any such compensation.  Further, the Company's
obligations to make any payments hereunder shall not be subject to or affected
by any setoff, counterclaims or defenses which the Company may have against
Executive or others.

          13.  Notices.  Any notice required or permitted to be given under this
               -------                                                          
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when

        C. The Company wishes to amend the Change-in-Control Agreement to 
recognize Employee's continuing contribution and provide incentive for 
Employee's ongoing efforts.

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained 
herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

        AGREEMENT:

        1. Cash Payment. Section 3.a. shall be changed to the following:

           The Employee shall be paid cash equal to three times the greater of:

           (i)  the sum of the Employee's Base Salary and Prior Year's Bonus as 
of the Termination of Employment, or

           (ii) the sum of the Employee's Base Salary and Prior Year's Bonus as 
of the Change-in-Control Date.

In addition, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Company's 
bonus plan, Employee shall be paid a pro rata portion of the maximum bonus to 
which he or she would have been entitled if (i) Employee had been employed by 
the Company as of the year-end in which the Termination of Employment had 
occurred, and (ii) the Company had achieved the highest targeted goals under the
bonus plan in effect for such year. The pro rata portion shall be determined
based on the number of days within the year that Employee was employed by the
Company, divided by 365 days. Payment shall be made in a single lump sum within
ten days following the date in which Employee's Termination of Employment
occurs.
